(Nasdaq: KINS)** (the \"Company\" or \"Kingstone\"), a Northeast regional property and casualty insurance holding company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company will hold its third quarter 2024 financial results conference call on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

The simultaneous achievement of these milestones is remarkable, driven in large part by the strength of our team, as well as the favorable market conditions that emerged just months ago. The timing could not have been more advantageous for Kingstone.\n\nCore business direct premiums written increased by 39% and 25% during the quarter and year-to-date, respectively. Our objective has always been, and will continue to be, profitable growth. We are managing our new business growth in a deliberate and strategic manner to ensure that we maintain our strong profitability.\n\nOur net combined ratio improved by 38.2 percentage points to 72.0% compared to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily driven by lower frequency and severity of claims due to risk selection in our Select product, the reduction in our non-core business and our disciplined underwriting approach. Contributing further to our profitability, severe weather conditions within our footprint were limited, adding only 1.7% to our loss ratio, which was more than offset by favorable prior year reserve development of 1.9%. Our expense ratio was 33%, representing an increase of 1.3 percentage points from the prior year's third quarter, primarily driven by higher bonus and contingent commission for our talented employees and producers, based on the strong underwriting performance we achieved.\n\nMs. Golden concluded, \"With most of the year behind us and strong visibility into the fourth quarter, we are raising both our full-year 2024 and 2025 guidance. We have successfully executed our strategy and delivered meaningful, sustainable value for our shareholders. Moving forward, our priority remains maximizing value for our shareholders and ensuring the long-term success of the company.\n\n**Guidance**(see \"Disclaimer and Forward-Looking Statements\" below)\n\nFor 2024, the Company's current full year expectations are calculated based on anticipated net premiums earned of approximately $128million, and are as follows:\n\n**Guidance Metrics**| **2024 -

Such guidance remains subject to change based on management's ongoing review of the Company's 2024 and 2025 results and is a forward-looking statement (see below). Kingstone assumes no obligation to update this guidance. The actual results may be materially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in this press release and in Kingstone's annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission._\n\n_This press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. For more details on factors that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n_The risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following:_\n\n  * _the risk of significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events;_\n\n  * _risks related to the lack of a financial strength rating from A.M. Best;_\n\n  * _risks related to our indebtedness due on June 30, 2026, including due to the need to comply with certain financial covenants and limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiary to pay dividends to us;_\n\n  * _adverse capital, credit and financial market conditions;_\n\n  * _the unavailability of reinsurance at current levels and prices;_\n\n  * _the exposure to greater net insurance losses in the event of reduced reliance on reinsurance;_\n\n  * _the credit risk of our reinsurers;_\n\n  * _the inability to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital needed to grow our business;_\n\n  * _the effects of climate change on the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires;_\n\n  * _risks related to the limited market area of our business;_\n\n  * _risks related to a concentration of business in a limited number of producers;_\n\n  * _legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in insurance laws and regulations and their application by our regulators;_\n\n  * _limitations with regard to our ability to pay dividends;_\n\n  * _the effects of competition in our market areas;_\n\n  * _our reliance on certain key personnel;_\n\n  * _risks related to security breaches or other attacks involving our computer systems or those of our vendors; and_\n\n  *  _our reliance on information technology and information systems._\n\n\n\n\n_Kingstone undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law._\n\n_**Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures**_\n\n _**_Direct premiums written_** represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period._\n\n_**_Net premiums written_** are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company's policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results. Direct premiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company's net premiums earned._\n\n_**_Adjusted EBITDA_** is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA._\n\n_Management uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share_** is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share._\n\n_Management uses operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share_** is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share._\n\n_Management uses operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating return on equity_** is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity._\n\n_Management uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company's overall return on average common equity._\n\n_**_Underlying loss ratio_** is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses._\n\n_Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company's loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company's net loss ratio._\n\n_**_Net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes_** is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio._\n\n_Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company's net loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio.

(referred to herein as \"Kingstone\" or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), underwrites property and casualty insurance exclusively. KICO is\na New York domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 96.3% and\n88.5%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 95.6%\nand 88.1%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. Kingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency,\nInc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to\nthese agencies.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The principles for condensed interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited by\nan independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) but, in the\nopinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of\nthe Company’s financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 may not\nbe indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nComponents of ceded premiums written within prior year net earned premiums in Note 6 were reclassified to conform with an elected change in the prior year\npresentation during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, by recording ceded written premiums for the 12 months of the contract term at inception, rather than\nmonthly over the contract term, providing a full disclosure of the premiums ceded. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 2 – Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation; Going Concern\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further\ninformation.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern for a period of one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company’s $19,950,000 12.0% Senior Notes (the “2022 Notes”) were\ndue on December 30, 2024. The Company’s continuation as a going concern was dependent on its ability to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy such\nobligation. The 2022 Notes were refinanced on September 12, 2024, under a note exchange agreement with a refinanced balance of $14,950,000 as of\nSeptember 12, 2024 and a maturity date of June 30, 2026. (see Note 7 - Debt).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and includes the reserves for losses and\nloss adjustment expense (“LAE”), which are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate\n10\nTable of Contents\nclaim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of many years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with loss and LAE recoverable\nunder reinsurance contracts and other receivables or payable under reinsurance contracts related to contingent ceding commission revenue require judgments\nby management. On an ongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating these estimates. Actual results may differ\nsignificantly from the estimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, CMIC Properties, Inc. (“Properties”) and 15 Joys Lane, LLC (“15 Joys Lane”), which together own the land and building from which KICO\noperates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-\n09”), which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The\nstandard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. ASU-\n2023-09 is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-07), which introduces improvements\nto the information that a public entity discloses about its reportable segments and addresses investor requests for more information about reportable segment\nexpenses. ASU 2023-07 does not change the current guidance related to the identification of operating segments, the determination of reportable segments, or\nthe aggregation criteria. Rather, the new guidance introduces additional disclosure requirements and expands those requirements to entities with a single\nreportable segment, not just entities with multiple reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its disclosures.\nThe Company has determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows, or do not apply to its operations.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNote 3 - Investments\nFixed-Maturity Securities\nThe amortized cost, estimated fair value, and gross unrealized gains and losses on investments in fixed-maturity securities classified as available-for-sale for\nwhich an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCost or Gross Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Net\nAmortized Unrealized Less than 12 More than 12 Fair Unrealized\nCategory Cost Gains Months Months Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies (1) $ 5,999,188 $ - $ - $ (2,128) $ 5,997,060 $ (2,128)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 16,499,862 - - (2,610,572) 13,889,290 (2,610,572)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 107,655,225 31,957 (49,276) (3,854,059) 103,783,847 (3,871,378)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities (2) 46,749,976 135,681 (136) (5,097,373) 41,788,148 (4,961,828)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $ 176,904,251 $ 167,638 $ (49,412) $ (11,564,132) $ 165,458,345 $ (11,445,906)\n12\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Unrealized Losses\nCost or Gross Estimated Net\nAmortized Unrealized Less than 12 More than 12 Fair Unrealized\nCategory Cost Gains Months Months Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S.\ngovernment corporations and\nagencies (1) $ 20,954,764 $ 1,799 $ (17,373) $ - $ 20,939,190 $ (15,574)\nPolitical subdivisions of\nStates, Territories and\nPossessions 16,607,713 - - (3,209,161) 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 75,993,042 - - (5,885,296) 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and\nother asset backed securities\n(2) 50,905,423 113,761 (2,144) (6,541,731) 44,475,309 (6,430,114)\nTotal fixed-maturity\nsecurities $ 164,460,942 $ 115,560 $ (19,517) $ (15,636,188) $ 148,920,797 $ (15,540,145)\n(1) In October 2022, KICO placed certain U.S. Treasury securities to fulfill the required collateral for a sale-leaseback transaction in a\ndesignated custodian account (see Note 7 – Debt - “Equipment Financing”).

The\neligible collateral would be pledged to FHLBNY if KICO draws an advance from the FHLBNY credit line. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the eligible investments was approximately $10,944,000 and $11,412,000,\nrespectively.

The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to\nbe collected and the amortized cost basis, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company considers all available\nevidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded, which is recognized in net loss through an\nallowance for credit losses.

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,637,038 favorable and $16,420 favorable, respectively. Management, on a quarterly basis,\nperforms a review of open liability claims to assess carried case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve levels, giving consideration to both Company\nand industry trends.\nLoss and LAE Reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\n24\nTable of Contents\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where an\nunusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods – historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate estimate\nof IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\n25\nTable of Contents\nIn New York State, lawsuits for negligence are subject to certain limitations and must be commenced within three years from the date of the accident or are\notherwise barred. Accordingly, the Company’s exposure to unreported claims (“pure” IBNR) for accident dates of September 30, 2021 and prior is limited,\nalthough there remains the possibility of adverse development on reported claims (“case development” IBNR). In certain rare circumstances states have\nretroactively revised a statute of limitations. The Company is not aware of any such effort that would have a material impact on the Company’s results.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of September 30, 2024, net of reinsurance, as well as the cumulative reported\nclaims by accident year and total IBNR reserves as of September 30, 2024 included in the net incurred loss and allocated expense amounts.

The reinsurance program also provides income as a result\nof ceding commissions earned pursuant to the quota share reinsurance contracts. The Company’s participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve the\nCompany of its obligations to policyholders.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe Company earned ceding commission revenue under the 2024/2025 Treaty for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and under the 2023/2024 Treaty\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on a fixed provisional\n29\nTable of Contents\ncommission rate at which provisional ceding commissions are earned. The Company earned ceding commission revenue under its quota share reinsurance\nagreements that expired prior to the 2021/2023 Treaty based on: (i) a fixed provisional commission rate at which provisional ceding commissions were earned,\nand (ii) under certain of the quota share reinsurance agreements, a continuing sliding scale of commission rates and ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the\npolicies reinsured under each of these agreements based upon which contingent ceding commissions are earned. The sliding scale includes minimum and\nmaximum commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. The commission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned increase when the\nestimated ultimate loss ratio decreases and, conversely, the commission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned decrease when the estimated ultimate\nloss ratio increases.\nCeding commission revenue consists of the following:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,742,557 $ 4,992,312 $ 13,859,795 $ 15,733,145\nContingent ceding commissions earned (881) 544,015 10,953 660,799\n$ 4,741,676 $ 5,536,327 $ 13,870,748 $ 16,393,944\nProvisional ceding commissions are settled monthly. Balances due from reinsurers for contingent ceding commissions on quota share treaties are settled\nperiodically based on the Loss Ratio of each treaty year that ends on June 30, for the expired treaties that were subject to contingent commissions. As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net contingent ceding commissions payable to\nreinsurers under all treaties was approximately $724,000 and $3,302,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 7 – Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nIn July 2017, KICO became a member of, and invested in, the FHLBNY. KICO is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of FHLBNY. Based\non redemption provisions of FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, FHLBNY may declare dividends on the\nstock. Management reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nno impairment has been recognized. FHLBNY members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling\nmembers to customize advances, which are to be fully collateralized. Eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account\navailable for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the previous quarter. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew\nKICO’s ratings as KICO requested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO\nis currently only able to borrow on an overnight basis. If KICO has sufficient available collateral (as discussed below), based on KICO’s net admitted assets,\nthe maximum allowable advance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $12,907,000 and $12,813,000, respectively. Available\ncollateral as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $10,944,000 and $11,412,000, respectively. Advances are limited to 85% of the\namount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n30\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nDebt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n13.75% Senior Notes due 2026, net $ 11,339,350 $ —\n12.0% Senior Notes due 2024, net — 18,426,247\nEquipment financing 5,958,237 6,817,283\nBalance at end of period $ 17,297,587 $ 25,243,530\nExchange Agreements\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “2022 Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “2022\nExchanging Noteholders”) of the Company’s outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the 2022 Exchange Agreement, the\n2022 Exchanging Noteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2017\nNotes then outstanding.

See “2024 Notes” below for a discussion of a change in the expiration date of the Warrants.\nThe Company analyzed the 2024 Exchange Agreement under ASC 470–50 Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments. The Company determined that\nextinguishment accounting was applicable, as the present value of the cash flows of the 2024 Notes differed by more than 10% from the 2022 Notes, making it\na substantial change in terms. As a result, the 2022 Notes have been derecognized and the 2024 Notes recorded at fair value. No gain or loss was recognized on\nthe 2024 Exchange. Unamortized debt issue costs of $296,533 related to extinguished debt were expensed at the time the 2022 Notes were extinguished and\nrecorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other operating\nexpenses.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of\nrequired collateral was approximately $5,731,000 and $6,999,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was\napproximately $5,997,000 in United States Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was approximately\n$11,960,000 in United States Treasury securities.\nFuture contractual payment obligations under the Financing as of September 30, 2024 are as follows:\nFor the Years Ending December 31, Total\nRemainder of 2024 $ 294,816\n2025 1,223,293\n2026 1,296,901\n2027 1,119,021\n3,934,031\n2027 purchase price 2,024,206\nTotal $ 5,958,237\nNote 8 – Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends Declared and Paid\nOn November 11, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends. Future dividend policy will be subject to the\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n2014 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which a maximum of 700,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses. Incentive stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\n(except no later than five years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan,\nsubject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. On August 5, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan, including an increase in\nthe maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,400,000. On August 9, 2023,\nthe Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are\nauthorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,900,000. The 2014 Plan terminated on August 12, 2024 and no further awards may be granted under the\n2014 Plan after such date.\n34\nTable of Contents\n2024 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 7, 2024, the Company adopted the 2024 Equity Participation Plan (the “2024 Plan”). pursuant to which a maximum of 1,000,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company are authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation\nrights, and stock bonus awards. Incentive stock options granted under the 2024 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant (except no later than\nfive years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2024 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The\nBoard of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2024 Plan, subject to the provisions\nof the 2024 Plan. The 2024 Plan terminates on May 10, 2034 and no further awards may be granted under the 2024 Plan after such date.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no grants issued under the 2024 Plan.\nStock Options\nThe results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include stock-based compensation expense for stock options totaling\napproximately $53,000 and $-0-, respectively. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include stock-based\ncompensation expense for stock options totaling approximately $159,000 and $-0-, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is net of estimated forfeitures of approximately 12%. Such amounts have been included in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other operating expenses.\nThe weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.24 per share. No options were\ngranted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The fair value of stock options at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting\nrestrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price\nvolatility. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective\ninput assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single\nmeasure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for grants during the following periods:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nDividend Yield 0.00 % n/a\nVolatility 74.72 % n/a\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 4.17 % n/a\nExpected Life 3.50 years n/a\n35\nTable of Contents\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nExercise Remaining Aggregate\nStock Options Number of Shares Price per Share Contractual Term Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 107,201 $ 8.31 0.94 $ -\nGranted 318,750 $ 2.25 4.34 $ 2,199,375\nExercised (50,000) $ 8.72 - $ 25,000\nExpired/Forfeited (46,250) $ 2.25 4.67 $ 112,238\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 329,701 $ 3.24 3.56 $ 1,948,716\nVested and Exercisable at September 30, 2024 57,201 $ 7.95 0.32 $ 68,466\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at September 30, 2024 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of\nthe underlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $9.15 closing\nprice of the Company’s Common Stock on September 30, 2024. The total intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture.\nThe total intrinsic value of options when expired are determined as of the date of expiration.\nParticipants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise\nissuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised (\"Net Exercise\"), or by exchanging a number\nof shares owned for a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised (\"Share Exchange\").\nThe Company received 35,248 shares from the exercise of options under a Share Exchange for the purchase of 37,269 shares of Common Stock during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Such shares received under the Share Exchange have been included in the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets within treasury stock. The remaining 12,731 options exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were Net Exercises, resulting\nin the issuance of 690 shares of Common Stock. No options were exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of unamortized compensation cost related to 272,500 unvested stock option awards was approximately\n$132,000. Unamortized compensation cost as of September 30, 2024 is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.27\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the restricted Common Stock activity under the 2014 Plan for nine months ended September 30, 2024 is as follows:\n36\nTable of Contents\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value per Aggregate Fair\nRestricted Stock Awards Shares Share Value\nBalance at January 1, 2024 550,581 $ 3.82 $ 2,103,219\nGranted 178,459 $ 2.33 $ 416,211\nVested (446,044) $ 4.16 $ (1,855,543)\nForfeited (2,000) $ 4.80 $ (9,600)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 280,996 $ 2.33 $ 654,721\nFair value was calculated using the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, stock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $306,000 and $207,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nstock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $747,000 and $636,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). These amounts reflect the Company’s accounting expense\nand do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the directors, executives and employees.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the 2022 Exchange Agreement (see Note 7 – Debt – “Exchange Agreements”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants (the \"Warrants\") to the 2022 Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. Pursuant to the 2024 Exchange\nAgreement, the expiration date of the Warrants was extended to June 30, 2026 from December 30, 2025. The fair value of the Warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes. The fair value of the\nWarrants is being amortized over the life of the Warrants, which is 36.5 months through September 12, 2024 and effective as of such date, the unamortized\nbalance is being amortized over the extended life of the Warrants, which is now 21.5 months.\nIn accordance with ASC 815-40-35 - Derivatives and Hedging – Subsequent Measurement, the effect of a modification or an exchange shall be measured as the\ndifference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged instrument and the fair value of that instrument immediately before it is modified or exchanged.\nThe Company calculated the respective fair values and determined the difference was immaterial.\nThe Warrants are exercisable through June 30, 2026 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the Warrants may exercise their outstanding Warrants in\ncash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to\nthe exercise price of the Warrants being exercised (\"Net Exercise\").\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Holders exercised 67,500 Warrants under Net Exercises, resulting in the issuance of 60,557\nshares of Common Stock. No Warrants were exercised during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, Warrants for\nthe purchase of an aggregate of 902,025 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nShelf Registration\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with regard to the\nregistration of $50,000,000 of its equity and debt securities (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by\nthe SEC on April 22, 2024. Any offering made\n37\nTable of Contents\npursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement may only be made by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective\nShelf Registration Statement, relating to the offering.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which the Company currently has\nthe ability to issue and sell shares of its Common Stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, up to an\naggregate offering price of approximately $16,400,000 in what is commonly referred to as an “at-the-market” (“ATM”) program. During the three months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,079,601 shares of its Common Stock at a weighted average price of $8.48 per share and raised $8,897,908 in\nnet proceeds under the ATM program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,135,710 shares of its Common Stock at a\nweighted average price of $8.30 per share and raised $9,066,098 in net proceeds under the ATM program. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had\nremaining capacity to sell up to an additional $6,973,231 of Common Stock under the ATM program.\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly-owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 2,793,622 $ 5,283,016\nClaims reserve discount 1,207,972 1,204,334\nUnearned premium 3,122,458 2,742,603\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 2,160,080 1,986,782\nNet unrealized losses on securities 2,090,726 3,357,463\nOther 276,461 1,153,903\nTotal deferred tax assets 11,651,319 15,728,101\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,588,997 4,158,538\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 194,946 153,201\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,648,486 5,176,282\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 6,002,833 $ 10,551,819\n38\nTable of Contents\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers (“NOL”) are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nType of NOL 2024 2023 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2022-2023 $ 2,793,622 $ 5,283,016 None\nState only (A) 2,989,431 2,560,372 December 2027 - December 2044\nValuation allowance (2,989,431) (2,560,372)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 2,793,622 $ 5,283,016\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was approximately $45,991,249 and $39,390,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting\nsubsidiary, is not subject to state income taxes. KICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has\nrecorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of generating enough state taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs\nover their remaining lives, which expire between 2027 and 2044.\n(2) Deferred tax liability – Investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as\nCommercial Mutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative to a stock\nproperty and casualty insurance company. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in\nconsideration for the exchange of $3,750,000 principal amount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and\nunpaid interest on the surplus notes as of the date of conversion. As of the date of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along\nwith the accretion of the discount on the original purchase of the surplus notes totaled $2,921,319 (together “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of\nacquisition, the deferred tax liability on the Untaxed Interest was $1,169,000. A temporary difference with an indefinite life exists when the\nparent has a lower carrying value of its subsidiary for income tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was reduced to $759,543 upon the\nreduction of federal income tax rates as of December 31, 2017. The Company is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of $759,543 related\nto this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is sold, or the assets of KICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. If any had been recognized these\nwould have been reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 through December 31, 2023 remain subject to examination.\n39\nTable of Contents\nNote 10 – Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock\noutstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise\nof stock options and warrants as well as non-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes those\noptions and warrants with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented. For the three\nmonths and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were -0- and 61,270 options with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the\nCompany’s Common Stock during the periods. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no warrants with an exercise price\nin excess of the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods.\nThe computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where\nthe exercise of such options and warrants or vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the three months and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, no options, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have\nbeen anti-dilutive for the relevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per\ncommon share has not been adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share\nfollows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 11,404,360 10,756,156 11,142,043 10,754,709\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options 182,607 - 159,900 -\nWarrants 752,619 - 731,520 -\nRestricted stock awards 241,542 - 216,113 -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding, used for computing\ndiluted earnings (loss) per share 12,581,128 10,756,156 12,249,576 10,754,709\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy. Such proceedings are considered\nin estimating the liability for loss and LAE expenses.\nOffice Lease\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business. These leases are accounted\nfor as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company was a party to a non-cancellable operating lease, dated March 27, 2015, for its office facility for KICO located in Valley Stream, New York,\nwhich expired on March 31, 2024. The lease was not renewed.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s office operating leases is as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nLease cost 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease $ - $ 41,342 $ 41,342 $ 124,026\nTotal lease cost $ - $ 41,342 $ 41,342 $ 124,026\nOther information on operating leases\nCash payments included in the measurement of lease liability reported in\noperating cash flows $ - $ 49,145 $ 49,145 $ 96,629\nDiscount rate - 5.50 % 5.50 % 5.50 %\nRemaining lease term in years - 0.50 - 0.50\nRent expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $-0- and $41,342, respectively, and is included in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Rent expense for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $41,342 and $124,026, respectively, and is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements\nof operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses.\nEmployment Agreements\nMeryl Golden, President and Chief Executive Officer; formerly Chief Operating Officer\nEmployment Agreement effective as of January 1, 2021\nOn September 16, 2019, the Company and Meryl Golden entered into an employment agreement (the “Golden Employment Agreement”) pursuant to which\nMs. Golden served as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer.

See Note 7 – Debt.\n43\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is a New\nYork domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively,\n96.3% and 88.5% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively,\n95.6% and 88.1% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the\nbusiness outside of New York as our “non-Core” business.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies\nit places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies are\nwritten for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of these lines we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of September 30, 2024, these expired policies represent\napproximately 14.9% of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional Financial Information”.\n44\nTable of Contents\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures\nWe utilize the following key GAAP and non-GAAP measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business. See \"Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\" for a reconciliation of the below non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nUnderlying loss ratio: The underlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect\nof prior year loss reserve development and catastrophes losses. Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to\nreveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to\nvary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio.\nManagement believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing our underwriting performance. The most\ndirectly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not\nreflect our net loss ratio.\nNet loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes: Net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the\ndifference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is\nused by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause our net loss ratios to vary\nsignificantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management\nbelieves that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing our underwriting performance. The most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net loss\nratio and does not reflect our net loss ratio.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering\nits business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes: Net underwriting expense ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-\nGAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net underwriting expense ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net underwriting expense\nratio. Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by\ncatastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause our net underwriting expense ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of\noccurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the underwriting expense ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors\nto evaluate this component separately when reviewing our underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net underwriting\nexpense ratio. The net underwriting expense ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net underwriting expense\nratio and does not reflect our net underwriting expense ratio.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net\nunderwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and\nmay not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes: Net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is\ncomputed as the difference between GAAP combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net combined ratio. Management believes that this ratio is\nuseful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal\n45\nTable of Contents\nthe trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause our net combined ratios to vary significantly between periods as\na result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net combined ratio. Management believes that this measure is\nuseful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing our underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the\nnet combined ratio. The net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net combined ratio and does not\nreflect our net combined ratio.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nNet income (loss) from insurance underwriting business on a standalone basis: Net income (loss) from insurance underwriting business on a\nstandalone basis is a non-GAAP measure, which is computed as GAAP net income (loss) without the effect of holding company operations on GAAP net\nincome (loss). Management believes that this measure is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our insurance underwriting\nbusiness that may be obscured by holding company operations. Holding company operations cause our GAAP net income (loss) to vary significantly between\nperiods as a result of their magnitude and can have a significant impact on GAAP net income (loss). Management believes that this measure is useful for\ninvestors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing our underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is GAAP net\nincome (loss). Net income (loss) from insurance underwriting business on a standalone basis should not be considered a substitute for GAAP net income (loss)\nand does not reflect our GAAP net income (loss).\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other\nfactors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to\nmateriality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not\nmaterialize.\nApplication of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies.\nSee below a description of these critical accounting estimates. Also see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n46\nTable of Contents\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nProperty and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling both reported\n(“case”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and claims adjusting expenses. The liability for these reserves is estimated on an undiscounted basis,\nusing individual case-basis valuations and paid claims, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies. Due to the inherent\nuncertainty of the reserve process, actual loss costs could vary significantly compared to estimated loss costs. The below table provides detail of our reserves as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n($ in thousands) Gross Ceded Net Gross Ceded Net\nCase loss $ 54,648 $ 13,755 $ 40,893 $ 67,108 $ 19,538 $ 47,570\nCase LAE 6,189 1,214 4,975 5,726 1,121 4,605\nIBNR loss 40,895 11,483 29,412 37,262 10,665 26,597\nIBNR LAE 15,110 2,597 12,513 11,722 1,965 9,757\nTotal $ 116,842 $ 29,049 $ 87,794 $ 121,818 $ 33,289 $ 88,529\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nCase Reserves – Reserves for reported losses are based on an estimate of ultimate loss costs of an individual claim derived from individual case-basis\nvaluations, actual claims paid, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies.\nIBNR Reserves – IBNR reserves are estimates of claims that have occurred but as to which we have not yet been notified to establish the case reserve.\nIBNR is determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance and adjusted to current conditions.\nReinsurance\nWe purchase reinsurance to manage our underwriting risk on certain policies. Reinsurance receivables represent management’s best estimate of loss\nand LAE recoverable from reinsurers. Reinsurance receivables are estimated using the same methodologies as loss and LAE reserves. Changes in the methods\nand assumptions used could result in significant variances between actual and estimated losses.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on GAAP income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Changes in\nestimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) could result in significant changes to our\ndeferred tax asset or liability.\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences which result in differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. These assets and liabilities are carried at the enacted tax rates expected to apply when\nthe asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in estimates and assumptions in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss), or changes in the enacted tax rate, could result in significant variances between our carried deferred tax and tax recognized on\nthe recovery or settlement of the asset or liability.\nInvestments\nBonds are classified as held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”), and stocks are generally classified as AFS. Investments classified as\nHTM are carried at amortized cost, which requires very little judgement. Investments classified as AFS are generally carried at fair value with an unrealized\ngain/loss recorded in income. Actual results could vary significantly from the fair values recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss).\n47\nTable of Contents\nKingstone 2.0 (completed), Kingstone 3.0 (underway), and Change in Market Dynamics (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0”, were commenced to modernize our company. The\npillars of the new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthened the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse\nbackgrounds;\n2. Reduced expenses and increased efficiency by embracing technology, including converting to a new policy management system,\nretiring multiple legacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Developed and implemented a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk\nusing advanced analytics and an abundance of data; and\n4. Better managed our catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our probable maximum loss (“PML”)\nin order to mitigate the impact of the then emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we\ncoined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting\nresults, by stopping new business, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory constraints.\nWe have been aggressively reducing policy count. Our request to withdraw from the state of New Jersey was acknowledged in\nOctober 2023 and all remaining policies will be non-renewed over a two year period starting January 1, 2024. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, our non-Core policy count was down by 58.8% compared to September 30, 2023;\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported\nin each state and product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value. Inflation has been a dominant headwind that is\nshowing signs of stabilizing. We have been cognizant that inflation’s impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and,\nas such, we have been more frequent and aggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that\nsame inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we completed our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes\nwere insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums attributable to the heightened replacement costs. All policies\nare renewed at the most current replacement cost. Overall average written premium for our legacy Core homeowners policies for\nthe last 12 months, reflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 24.5%;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the\ngrowth rate of our PML. We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the\nrequired limit to be purchased while maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new\nbusiness that was deemed to be too expensive and at the same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the\ngreatest risk; and\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net underwriting expense ratio to 29% by year-end 2024. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, we achieved our goal of 33%, with a net underwriting expense ratio of 32.9%. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the net underwriting expense ratio was 31.9%, a reduction of 1.1 points compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 but higher than our goal due to a higher accrual for employee bonuses and contingent\ncommissions for producers to reflect greater profitability than originally projected.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the above actions taken resulted in our return to profitability for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, will\ncontinue to have the intended effect and will continue through the remainder 2024 to result in a return to annual profitability.\nOn August 2, 2024, two large competitors announced a plan to wind down their personal lines operations in New York State and to non-renew or mid-\nterm cancel their entire book of business before year end 2024. The policyholders of such competitors will need to find alternative coverage. In the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, we are seeing a sizable increase in our policies in force and direct written premiums from these non-renewed and cancelled\npolicies. We refer to this new business as a Change in Market Dynamics.\nSee the tables below for our Core and non-Core business for policies in force as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and direct written premiums for the\nthree months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Core direct written premiums\nincreased by 39.4% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, while Core policies in force increased by 1.2% as of September 30, 2024 as\ncompared to September 30, 2023. For the same periods, our non-Core policies in force decreased by 58.8% and non-Core direct written premiums also\ndecreased by 58.8%.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Core direct written premiums increased by 25.0% compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, while Core policies in force increased by 1.2% as of September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023.

Effective January 1, 2024, we entered into a 27%\npersonal lines quota share treaty, which includes a runoff of a 3.0% portion through the end of 2024.\n(2) The nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a\ncatastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services\nOffice (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a\nsignificant number of policyholders and insurers.\nNine months ended September 30,\nPercentage\nPoint Percent\n2024 2023 Change Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 48.8 % 77.7 % (28.9) (37.2)%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 31.9 % 33.0 % (1.1) (3.3)%\nNet combined ratio 80.7 % 110.7 % (30.0) (27.1)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (“Nine Months 2024”) were $169,447,000 compared to $147,237,000\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (“Nine Months 2023”). The increase of $22,210,000, or 15.1%, was primarily due to an increase in\npremiums from our personal lines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Nine Months 2024 were $159,213,000, an increase of $22,612,000, or 16.6%, from\n$136,601,000 in Nine Months 2023. The 16.6% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the increase in premiums\nassociated with our Core business of 25.0% offsetting a 58.0% decrease in our non-Core business. The increase in our Core business premiums and the\ndecrease in our non-Core business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans. Beginning in the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Change in Market Dynamics became a major factor to the increase in direct written premiums from our personal line business.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Nine Months 2024 were $10,166,000, a decrease of $393,000, or 3.7%, from\n$10,559,000 in Nine Months 2023. The decrease in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an underwriting restriction in place to exclude\ncertain electric vehicles until the approval of adequate rate for the risk was received, which happened in July 2024. The decrease was offset by an increase in\nthe values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $162,063,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $129,665,000 in Nine Months 2023, an\nincrease of $32,398,000, or 25.0%. The increase in direct written premiums from our Core business was due to rate increases and an increase in policies in\nforce. Policies in force from our Core business increased by 1.2% in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023. Direct written premiums from our\nnon-Core business were $7,384,000 in Nine Months 2024, as compared to $17,572,000 in Nine Months 2023, a decrease of $10,188,000, or 58.0%. The\ndecrease in direct written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies\nin force from our non-Core business decreased by 58.8% in Nine Months 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023. The increase in our Core business and the\ndecrease in our non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums increased $28,792,000, or 40.4%, to $100,065,000 in Nine Months 2024 from $71,273,000 in Nine Months 2023. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe increase in Nine Months 2024 is primarily due\n52\nTable of Contents\nto the additional premiums from the Change in Market Dynamics, changes to our personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty, and a decrease in catastrophe\nreinsurance premiums. See quota share reinsurance treaties discussion below.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nOn January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1,\n2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”). Our personal lines\nbusiness was subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty in Nine Months 2024, and the 2023/2024 Treaty in Nine Months 2023. In Nine Months 2024, our premiums\nceded under quota share treaties decreased by $3,623,000 in comparison to premiums ceded under quota share treaties in Nine Months 2023 (see table above).\nThe decrease in Nine Months 2024 was attributable to the decrease in quota share ceding percentage rates, offset by an increase in direct written premiums\nsubject to the 2024/2025 Treaty compared to direct written premiums subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Nine Months 2024, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $630,000 over the comparable ceded excess of loss premiums for Nine Months 2023. The increase was due to an increase\nin subject premiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty\n(the “Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. The Underlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance\ncoverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms were excluded from the Underlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2024,\nthe Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe reinsurance treaties. An increase in our personal\nlines business historically gave rise to more property exposure, which increased our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under\ncatastrophe treaties would increase. An increase in our personal lines business historically resulted in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe\ntreaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are increasing. Under Kingstone 2.0 and 3.0 we had a decrease in policies in force, resulting in a decrease in\ncatastrophe exposure, and a decrease in catastrophe premiums. On July 1, 2024 and 2023, we recorded our catastrophe premiums written for the entire treaty\nperiod covering July 1 through June 30, resulting in the entire annual premium written being recorded in the third quarter. Our catastrophe premiums were\n$29,682,000 in Nine Months 2024, compared to $33,271,000 in Nine Months 2023, a decrease of $3,589,000, or 10.8%.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $6,830,000, or 8.0%, to $92,531,000 in Nine Months 2024 from $85,701,000 in Nine Months 2023. The increase was\ndue to the three percentage point reduction in quota share rates discussed above, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the\npremiums ceded and reduced the net premiums earned in Nine Months 2023, the increase in premiums from the Change in Market Dynamics in Nine Months\n2024, and a decrease in catastrophe premium rates after June 30, 2024 reflected in ceded catastrophe premiums earned, which increased the amount of growth\nin net premiums earned. offset by an increase in catastrophe premium rates through June 30, 2024, reflected in ceded catastrophe premiums earned, which\nreduced the amount of growth in net premiums earned during the first six months of 2024.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nNine months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 13,860 $ 15,733 $ (1,873) (11.9)%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 11 661 (650) (98.3)%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 13,871 $ 16,394 $ (2,523) (15.4)%\nCeding commission revenue was $13,871,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $16,394,000 in Nine Months 2023. The decrease of $2,523,000 is\nexplained below in the discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Nine Months 2024, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $13,860,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2024/2025\nTreaty, and in Nine Months 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $15,733,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty. The decrease of $1,873,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the decrease in premiums ceded under these treaties during Nine\nMonths 2024 compared to Nine Months 2023, offset by an increase in ceding commission rates under the 2024/2025 Treaty.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2024/2025 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $4,917,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $4,437,000 in Nine Months 2023, an increase of $480,000, or 10.8%. The\naverage yield on non-cash invested assets was 3.50% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 3.73% as of September 30, 2023.\nCash and invested assets were $221,847,000 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $172,095,000 as of September 30, 2023, an increase of\n$49,752,000.\nNet Gains on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $1,319,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to net gains of $598,000 in Nine Months 2023. Unrealized gains on our\nequity securities and other investments in Nine Months 2024 were $1,379,000, compared to unrealized gains of $615,000 in Nine Months 2023. Net realized\n(losses) on sales of investments were $(60,000) in Nine Months 2024 compared to net realized (losses) of $(17,000) in Nine Months 2023.\nOther Income\nOther income was $401,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $454,000 in Nine Months 2023, a decrease of $53,000, or 11.7%.\n54\nTable of Contents\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $45,125,000 for Nine Months 2024 compared to $66,553,000 for Nine Months 2023. The net loss ratio was 48.8% in Nine\nMonths 2024 compared to 77.7% in Nine Months 2023, a decrease of 28.9 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nThe net loss ratio for Nine Months 2024 improved significantly compared to Nine Months 2023. For Nine Months 2024, the catastrophe impact, prior\nyear development, and underlying loss ratio(1) (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) were all lower than for Nine Months\n2023.\nThere were sixteen newly designated catastrophe events for Nine Months 2024. The estimated total net catastrophe impact for Nine Months 2024 was\n$2,454,000, which contributed 2.7 points to the loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Nine Months 2023 was 8.5 points. Losses from winter-\nrelated catastrophe claims were minimal during Nine Months 2024, whereas the previous year was impacted by a major winter event in February 2023.\nThe underlying loss ratio(1) was 47.9% for Nine Months 2024, a decrease of 21.3 points from the 69.2% underlying loss ratio(1) recorded for Nine\nMonths 2023. Overall personal lines non-catastrophe frequency for Nine Months 2024 was lower than the same period in 2023, which is believed to be the\nresult of better risk selection in the Company’s Select product as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Overall non-\ncatastrophe severity for Nine Months 2024 also improved compared to Nine Months 2023, primarily driven by the reduction in the non-Core business and a\nreduced impact from large losses.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThere was favorable prior year development of $1,637,000 during Nine Months 2024, which translates to a 1.8 point decrease to the net loss ratio. By\ncomparison, the impact of prior year development for Nine Months 2023 was a decrease of less than 0.1 points.\n(1) Underlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of prior year loss\nreserve development and catastrophes losses. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for the reconciliation of underlying loss ratio to the GAAP measure of net\nloss ratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $25,089,000 in Nine Months 2024 or 16.2% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $25,221,000 in Nine\nMonths 2023 or 16.6% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $132,000 was primarily due to a reduction in commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with our Kingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products. The decrease was\noffset by an accrual of $2,126,000 for estimated contingent commissions based on the profitability of the business.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $18,676,000, or 12.0% of direct earned premiums, in Nine Months 2024 compared to $19,874,000, or 13.1% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Nine Months 2023. The decrease of $1,198,000, or 6.0%, was primarily due to a $365,000 gain on the commutations of prior years’\nquota share reinsurance treaties from a group of reinsurers, decreases in salaries and employment costs as described below, and a decrease in policy\nmanagement system fees. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of high inflation.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $9,595,000 in Nine Months 2024\ncompared to $8,692,000 in Nine Months 2023. The increase of $903,000, or 10.4%, is favorable when compared to the 15.1% increase in direct written\npremiums. The increase in salaries and employment costs was due to $1,125,000 accrued under our employee bonus plans due to the profitable underwriting\ninsurance operations in Nine Months 2024 compared to a loss in Nine Months 2023, and $290,000 accrued under our executive bonus plan pursuant to the\nemployment agreement of our Chief Executive Officer. The increases related to bonuses were offset by a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we\nhave been reducing our non-Core business. The decrease from the reduction in staff was partially offset in the periods following Nine Months 2023, as we\nbegan to strengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and staff needed to manage the business\nconsistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies. In addition, we are now hiring additional staff to handle the new business from the Change in\nMarket Dynamics.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Nine Months 2024 was 31.9% compared to 33.0% in Nine Months 2023.

The increase in equity compensation is due to accelerated vesting in September 2024 as a result of the retirement of our\nexecutive chairman, and an equity compensation liability accrual for our senior leadership team pursuant to our employee bonus plan. The $297,000 loss on\nextinguishment of debt loss is due to writing off the balance of unamortized debt issue costs from the 2022 Notes at the time of the 2024 Exchange Agreement\nas disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,836,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $2,328,000 in Nine Months 2023. The decrease of $492,000, or\n21.1%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, which allowed us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Nine Months 2024 was $2,884,000 compared to $3,005,000 in Nine Months 2023, a decrease of $121,000 or 4.0%. In Nine\nMonths 2024 and Nine Months 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred interest expense in connection\nwith the 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes. The 2022 Notes provided for interest at the rate of 12% per annum. In September 2024, in accordance with the 2024\nExchange Agreement, we paid $5,000,000 of principal on the 2022 Notes, reducing the principal balance to $14,950,000 from $19,950,000. Under the 2024\nExchange Agreement, the balance of the 2022 Notes were exchanged for the 2024 Notes, which provide for interest at the rate of 13.75% per annum. In\nSeptember 2024 we paid an additional principal amount of $3,000,000 reducing the balance of the 2024 Notes to $11,950,000 at September 30, 2024. On\nNovember 13, 2024, we made an optional prepayment of $2,000,000 on the 2024 Notes, further reducing the balance to $9,950,000. In addition, we also incur\ninterest expense on the 2022 equipment financing.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in Nine Months 2024 was $3,689,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.2%. Income tax (benefit) in Nine Months 2023\nwas $(2,149,000), which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.1%. Income before taxes was $16,609,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to a (loss) before\ntaxes of $(11,264,000) in Nine Months 2023. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Nine Months 2024 compared to\nNine Months 2023.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $12,920,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to a net (loss) of $(9,114,000) in Nine Months 2023. The increase from net loss to net\nincome of $23,034,000 was due to the circumstances described above.\n58\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 66,627 $ 51,992 $ 14,635 28.1 %\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n66,627 51,992 14,635 28.1 %\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 14,168 12,210 1,958 16.0 %\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 1,726 1,726 - — %\nCeded to catastrophe treaties 30,188 34,381 (4,193) (12.2)%\nTotal ceded written premiums 46,081 48,317 (2,236) (4.6)%\nNet written premiums 20,545 3,675 16,870 459.0 %\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed (12,540) (1,247) (11,293) (906)%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (1) 25,402 25,510 (108) (0.4)%\nChange in net unearned premiums 12,862 24,263 (11,401) (47.0)%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 54,087 50,745 3,342 6.6 %\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (20,679) (22,807) 2,128 9.3 %\nNet premiums earned 33,407 27,938 5,469 19.6 %\nCeding commission revenue (1) 4,742 5,536 (794) (14.3)%\nNet investment income 1,650 1,444 206 14.3 %\nNet gains (losses) on investments 827 (824) 1,651 na%\nOther income 147 142 5 3.5 %\nTotal revenues 40,772 34,237 6,535 19.1 %\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 16,212 29,570 (13,358) (45.2)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 740 2,871 (2,131) (74.2)%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 16,952 32,441 (15,489) (47.7)%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 3,766 9,797 (6,031) (61.6)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 158 712 (554) (77.8)%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 3,924 10,509 (6,585) (62.7)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 12,445 19,773 (7,328) (37.1)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 582 2,159 (1,577) (73.0)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 13,028 21,932 (8,904) (40.6)%\nCommission expense 9,004 8,210 794 9.7 %\nOther underwriting expenses 6,895 6,319 576 9.1 %\nOther operating expenses 1,242 442 800 181.0 %\nDepreciation and amortization 619 741 (122) (16.5)%\nInterest expense 900 989 (89) (9.0)%\nTotal expenses 31,688 38,633 (6,945) (18.0)%\nIncome (loss) before taxes 9,084 (4,397) 13,481 na%\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 2,106 (859) 2,965 na%\nNet income (loss) $ 6,978 $ (3,538) $ 10,516 na%\n59\nTable of Contents\n(1) For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our personal lines business was subject to a 30% quota share treaty, expiring on\nJanuary 1, 2024, which included a runoff of an 8.5% portion through the remainder of 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, we entered into\na 27% personal lines quota share treaty, which includes a runoff of a 3.0% portion through the end of 2024.\n(2) The three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which\na catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services\nOffice (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a\nsignificant number of policyholders and insurers.\nThree months ended September 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Point Change Percent Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 39.0 % 78.5 % (39.5) (50.3)%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 33.0 % 31.7 % 1.3 4.1 %\nNet combined ratio 72.0 % 110.2 % (38.2) (34.7)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (“Three Months 2024”) were $66,627,000 compared to $51,992,000\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023 (“Three Months 2023”). The increase of $14,635,000, or 28.1%, was primarily due to an increase in\npremiums from our personal lines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Three Months 2024 were $63,336,000, an increase of $14,917,000, or 30.8%, from\n$48,419,000 in Three Months 2023. The 30.8% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the increase in premiums\nassociated with our Core business of 39.4% offsetting a 58.8% decrease in our non-Core business. The increase in our Core business premiums and the\ndecrease in our non-Core business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans. Beginning in Three Months 2024,\nthe Change in Market Dynamics became a major factor to the increase in direct written premiums from our personal line business.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Three Months 2024 were $3,266,000, a decrease of $278,000, or 7.8%, from\n$3,544,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an underwriting restriction in place to exclude\ncertain electric vehicles until the approval of adequate rate for the risk was received, which happened in July 2024. The decrease was offset by an increase in\nthe values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $64,170,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $46,026,000 in Three Months 2023, an\nincrease of $18,144,000, or 39.4%. The increase in direct written premiums from our Core business was due to rate increases and an increase in policies in\nforce. Policies in force from our Core business increased by 1.2% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. Direct written premiums from our\nnon-Core business were $2,457,000 in Three Months 2024 as compared to $5,966,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $3,509,000, or 58.8%. The\ndecrease in direct written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies\nin force from our non-Core business decreased by 58.8% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. The increase in our Core business and the\ndecrease in our non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums increased $16,870,000, or 459.0%, to $20,545,000 in Three Months 2024 from $3,675,000 in Three Months 2023. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe increase in Three Months 2024 is primarily due to the additional premiums from the Change in Market Dynamics, changes to our personal lines quota\nshare reinsurance treaty, and a decrease in catastrophe reinsurance premiums. See quota share reinsurance treaties discussion below.\n60\nTable of Contents\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nOn January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1,\n2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”). Our personal lines\nbusiness was subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty in Three Months 2024, and the 2023/2024 Treaty in Three Months 2023. In Three Months 2024, our premiums\nceded under quota share treaties increased by $1,958,000 in comparison to premiums ceded under quota share treaties in Three Months 2023 (see table above).\nThe increase in Three Months 2024 was attributable to the increase in direct written premiums subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty compared to direct written\npremiums subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty. The increase in ceded premiums related to the increase in direct written premiums was offset by the decrease in\nquota share ceding percentage rates.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Three Months 2024, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums remained flat over the comparable ceded excess of loss premiums for Three Months 2023. Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into an\nunderlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (the “Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. The\nUnderlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms were excluded from the\nUnderlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2024, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1,\n2025.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe reinsurance treaties. An increase in our personal\nlines business historically gave rise to more property exposure, which increased our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under\ncatastrophe treaties would increase. An increase in our personal lines business historically resulted in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe\ntreaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are increasing. Under Kingstone 2.0 and 3.0 we had a decrease in policies in force, resulting in a decrease in\ncatastrophe exposure, and a decrease in catastrophe premiums. On July 1, 2024 and 2023, we recorded our catastrophe premiums written for the entire treaty\nperiod covering July 1 through June 30, resulting in the entire annual premium written being recorded in the third quarter. Our catastrophe premiums were\n$30,188,000 in Three Months 2024, compared to $34,381,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $4,193,000, or 12.2%.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $5,469,000, or 19.6%, to $33,407,000 in Three Months 2024 from $27,938,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase\nwas due to the three percentage point reduction in quota share rates discussed above, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the\npremiums ceded and reduced the net premiums earned in Three Months 2023, the increase in premiums from the Change in Market Dynamics in Three Months\n2024, and a decrease in catastrophe premium rates, reflected in ceded catastrophe premiums earned, which increased the amount of growth in net premiums\nearned.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,743 $ 4,992 $ (249) (5.0)%\nContingent ceding commissions earned (1) 544 (545) na%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 4,742 $ 5,536 $ (794) (14.3)%\n61\nTable of Contents\nCeding commission revenue was $4,742,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $5,536,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $794,000 is\nexplained below in the discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Three Months 2024, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,743,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2024/2025\nTreaty, and in Three Months 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of 4,992,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty. The decrease of $249,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the decrease in premiums ceded under these treaties during Three\nMonths 2024 compared to Three Months 2023, offset by an increase in ceding commission rates under the 2024/2025 Treaty.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2024/2025 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $4,917,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $4,437,000 in Three Months 2023, an increase of $480,000, or 10.8%. The\naverage yield on non-cash invested assets was 3.50% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 3.73% as of September 30, 2023.\nCash and invested assets were $221,847,000 as of September 30, 2024 compared to $172,095,000 as of September 30, 2023, an increase of\n$49,752,000.\nNet Gains on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $827,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to net (losses) of $(824,000) in Three Months 2023. Unrealized gains on\nour equity securities and other investments in Three Months 2024 were $461,000, compared to unrealized (losses) of $(820,000) in Three Months 2023. Net\nrealized gains on sales of investments were $366,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to net realized (losses) of $(4,000) in Three Months 2023.\nOther Income\nOther income was $147,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $142,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $5,000, or 3.5%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $13,028,000 for Three Months 2024 compared to $21,932,000 for Three Months 2023. The net loss ratio was 39.0% in Three\nMonths 2024 compared to 78.5% in Three Months 2023, a decrease of 39.5 percentage points.\n62\nTable of Contents\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nThe net loss ratio for Three Months 2024 improved significantly compared to Three Months 2023. For Three Months 2024, the catastrophe impact,\nprior year development, and underlying loss ratio (1) (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) were all lower than Three\nMonths 2023.\nThere were six newly designated catastrophe events for Three Months 2024, and the total loss ratio impact was immaterial. The estimated total net\ncatastrophe impact for the calendar quarter was $582,000, which contributed 1.7 points to the net loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Three\nMonths 2023 was 7.7 points.\nThe underlying loss ratio(1) was 39.2% for Three Months 2024, a decrease of 31.6 points from the 70.8% underlying loss ratio(1) recorded for Three\nMonths 2023. Overall personal lines non-catastrophe frequency for Three Months 2024 was lower than the same period in 2023, which is believed to be the\nresult of better risk selection in the Company’s Select product rollout as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Overall non-\ncatastrophe severity for Three Months 2024 was also improved compared to Three Months 2023, primarily driven by the reduction in non-Core business and a\nreduced impact from large losses.\nThere was favorable prior year development of $641,000 during Three Months 2024, which translates to a 1.9-point decrease to the loss ratio. By\ncomparison, the impact of prior year development for Three Months 2023 was an increase of less than 0.1 points.\n(1) Underlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of prior year loss\nreserve development and catastrophes losses. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for the reconciliation of underlying loss ratio to the GAAP measure of net\nloss ratio.\n63\nTable of Contents\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $9,004,000 in Three Months 2024 or 16.6% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $8,210,000 in Three\nMonths 2023 or 16.2% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $794,000 was primarily due to an accrual of $1,278,000 for an estimated contingent\ncommission based on the profitability of the business. The increase was offset by a reduction in commission rates on our legacy policies in accordance with our\nKingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $6,895,000, or 12.7% of direct earned premiums, in Three Months 2024 compared to $6,319,000, or 12.5% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Three Months 2023. The increase of $576,000, or 9.1%, was primarily due to employee and executive bonuses as described below,\npartially offset by a decrease in policy management system fee, and a decrease in other IT costs. In addition, other operating expenses were impacted by\ninflation. Our largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs excluding employee bonuses of $2,893,000\nin Three Months 2024 compared to $2,817,000 in Three Months Ended 2023. The increase of $76,000, or 2.7%, is favorable when compared to the 28.1%\nincrease in direct written premiums. In Three Months 2024, employee bonuses accruals were $674,000 accrued under our employee bonus plan due to the\nprofitable underwriting insurance operations in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss in Three Months 2023, and $290,000 accrued under our executive bonus\nplan pursuant to the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Three Months 2024 was 33.0% compared to 31.7% in Three Months 2023. The following table shows the\nindividual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30,\nPercentage\n2024 2023 Point Change\nOther underwriting expenses\nEmployment costs 11.5 % 10.1 % 1.4\nUnderwriting fees (inspections/surveys) 1.3 1.5 (0.2)\nIT expenses 2.2 2.9 (0.7)\nProfessional fees 0.6 1.1 (0.5)\nOther expenses 5.0 7.0 (2.0)\nTotal other underwriting expenses 20.6 22.6 (2.0)\nCommission expense 27.0 29.4 (2.4)\nCeding commission revenue\nProvisional (14.2) (17.9) 3.7\nContingent - (1.9) 1.9\nTotal ceding commission revenue (14.2) (19.8) 5.6\nOther income (0.4) (0.5) 0.1\nNet underwriting expense ratio 33.0 % 31.7 % 1.3\n(Components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n64\nTable of Contents\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company and Cosi, were $1,242,000 for Three Months 2024 compared to $442,000\nfor Three Months 2023.

The increase in equity compensation is due to accelerated vesting in September 2024 as a result of the\nretirement of our executive chairman, and an equity compensation liability accrual for our senior leadership team pursuant to our employee bonus plan. The\n$297,000 loss on extinguishment of debt loss is due to writing off the balance of unamortized debt issue costs from the 2022 Notes at the time of the 2024\nExchange Agreement as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in executive\nbonus. A bonus is accrued pursuant to the employment agreement of our Chief Executive Officer. The negative executive bonus of $85,000 is due to a\n$117,000 reallocation of the bonus to other underwriting expenses accrued through June 30, 2024. The net accrual of $32,000 is a result of the profitable\noperations before taxes in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss in Three Months 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $619,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $741,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $122,000, or\n16.5%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Three Months 2024 was $900,000 compared to $989,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $89,000 or 9.0%. In Three Months\n2024 and Three Months 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred interest expense in connection with the\n2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes. The 2022 Notes provided for interest at the rate of 12% per annum. In September 2024, in accordance with 2024 Exchange\nAgreement, we paid $5,000,000 of principal on the 2022 Notes, reducing the principal balance to $14,950,000 from $19,950,000. Under the 2024 Exchange\nAgreement, the balance of the 2022 Notes were exchanged for the 2024 Notes, which provide for\n65\nTable of Contents\ninterest at the rate of 13.75% per annum. In September 2024 we paid an additional principal amount of $3,000,000 reducing the balance of the 2024 Notes to\n$11,950,000 at September 30, 2024. On November 13, 2024, we made an optional prepayment of $2,000,000 on the 2024 Notes, further reducing the balance\nto $9,950,000. In addition, we also incur interest expense on the 2022 equipment financing.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in Three Months 2024 was $2,106,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 23.2%. Income tax (benefit) in Three Months\n2023 was $(859,000), which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.5%. Income before taxes was $9,084,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss before\ntaxes of $4,397,000 in Three Months 2023. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Three Months 2024 compared to\nThree Months 2023.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $6,978,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to a net loss of $3,538,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase from net loss to net\nincome of $10,516,000 was due to the circumstances described above.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance. Within this segment, we offer an array of property and casualty policies to\nour producers. The following table summarizes gross and net written premiums, net premiums earned, and net loss and loss adjustment expenses by major\nproduct type, which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics and risks of loss.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross premiums written:\nPersonal lines $ 63,336,355 $ 48,418,956 $ 159,213,386 $ 136,601,070\nLivery physical damage 3,265,709 3,543,810 10,165,891 10,559,310\nOther(1) 24,600 29,480 67,326 76,256\nTotal gross premiums written $ 66,626,664 $ 51,992,246 $ 169,446,603 $ 147,236,636\nNet premiums written:\nPersonal lines $ 17,261,087 $ 110,328 $ 89,848,898 $ 60,662,578\nLivery physical damage 3,265,709 3,543,810 10,165,891 10,559,310\nOther(1) 18,395 21,162 50,478 51,179\nTotal net premiums written $ 20,545,191 $ 3,675,300 $ 100,065,267 $ 71,273,067\nNet premiums earned:\nPersonal lines $ 29,801,629 $ 24,346,521 $ 81,558,589 $ 75,441,482\nLivery physical damage 3,587,808 3,571,160 10,916,903 10,192,773\nOther(1) 17,757 20,637 55,216 67,212\nTotal net premiums earned $ 33,407,194 $ 27,938,318 $ 92,530,708 $ 85,701,467\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses(3):\nPersonal lines $ 9,806,057 $ 19,132,159 $ 35,548,883 $ 59,627,739\nLivery physical damage 1,546,732 1,720,620 4,715,035 3,999,787\nOther(1) (10,938) (13,757) (40,133) 137,886\nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses 1,396,211 732,061 3,858,810 2,453,114\nTotal without commercial lines in run-off 12,738,062 21,571,083 44,082,595 66,218,526\nCommercial lines (in run-off effective July 2019)(2) 289,535 363,370 1,042,897 334,039\nTotal net loss and loss adjustment expenses $ 13,027,597 $ 21,934,453 $ 45,125,492 $ 66,552,565\nNet loss ratio(3):\nPersonal lines 32.9 % 78.6 % 43.6 % 79.0 %\nLivery physical damage 43.1 % 48.2 % 43.2 % 39.2 %\nOther(1) -61.6 % (66.7 %) -72.7 % 205.2 %\nTotal without commercial lines in run-off 38.1 % 77.2 % 47.6 % 77.3 %\nCommercial lines (in run-off effective July 2019)(2) na na na na\nTotal 39.0 % 78.5 % 48.8 % 77.7 %\n(1) “Other” includes, among other things, premiums and loss and loss adjustment expenses from our participation in a mandatory state joint\nunderwriting association and loss and loss adjustment expenses from commercial auto.\n(2) In July 2019, we decided that we will no longer underwrite Commercial Liability risks.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources\n(“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or\nunavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for\nsimilar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level 2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market\nparticipants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level 3”). As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 68% and 65%, respectively, of the\ninvestment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the\nsecurity has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ - $ - - $ 5,997,060 $ (2,128) 1 $ 5,997,060 $ (2,128)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,889,291 (2,610,572) 12 13,889,291 (2,610,572)\nCorporate and other bonds industrial\nand miscellaneous 17,557,547 (49,276) 18 63,278,931 (3,854,059) 74 80,836,478 (3,903,335)\nResidential mortgage and other asset\nbacked securities 8,405 (136) 1 37,008,025 (5,097,373) 36 37,016,430 (5,097,509)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $ 17,565,952 $ (49,412) 19 $ 120,173,307 $ (11,564,132) 123 $ 137,739,259 $ (11,613,544)\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373) 1 $ - $ - - $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,398,552 (3,209,161) 13 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds industrial\nand miscellaneous - - - 70,107,746 (5,885,296) 85 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and other asset\nbacked securities 88,988 (2,144) 4 38,675,604 (6,541,731) 37 38,764,592 (6,543,875)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $ 6,063,428 $ (19,517) 5 $ 122,181,902 $ (15,636,188) 135 $ 128,245,330 $ (15,655,705)\nThere were 142 securities at September 30, 2024 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of\nwhich were deemed to be credit losses by us. There were 140 securities at\n79\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed to be credit\nlosses by us. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude of\nthe unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and interest rate environment factors, management’s intent not to sell these\nsecurities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends and distributions received from KICO, which are subject to statutory\nrestrictions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, KICO did not pay any dividends to us. Through June 30, 2024, the end of the previous quarter,\nKICO had a negative adjusted unassigned surplus. Based on that, KICO was not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. In\nDecember 2023, KICO received regulatory approval to pay us a $2,300,000 distribution from paid in capital. KICO paid us the $2,300,000 distribution in the\nsecond quarter of 2024. In August 2024, KICO received regulatory approval to pay us a $5,000,000 distribution from paid in capital. KICO paid us the\n$5,000,000 distribution in the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, KICO has eligible unassigned surplus of $6,221,687 and is able to pay\ndividends.\nKICO is a member of the FHLBNY, which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low-cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of\nKICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is June 30, 2024. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew KICO’s ratings as KICO\nrequested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO is currently only able to\nborrow on an overnight basis. The maximum allowable advance as of September 30, 2024, based on the net admitted assets as of June 30, 2024, was\napproximately $12,907,000. Available collateral as of September 30, 2024 was approximately $10,944,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of\navailable collateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during Nine Months 2024.\nOn April 5, 2024, we filed a shelf registration (the “Shelf Registration”) statement on Form S-3 with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, with regard to the registration of $50,000,000 of our equity and debt securities (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Shelf Registration\nStatement was declared effective by the SEC on April 22, 2024. Any offering made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement may only be made by means\nof a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective Shelf Registration Statement, relating to the offering.\nIn May 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which we currently have the ability\nto issue and sell shares of our Common Stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, up to an aggregate\noffering price of approximately $16,400,000 in what is commonly referred to as an “at-the-market” (“ATM”) program. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we sold 1,079,601 shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $8.48 per share and raised $8,897,908 in net proceeds\nunder the ATM program. As of September 30, 2024, we had remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $6,973,231 of our Common Stock under the ATM\nprogram.\nOn September 12, 2024, we issued the 2024 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $14,950,000 pursuant to the 2024 Exchange Agreement.\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year at the rate of 13.75% per annum. The maturity date of the 2024 Notes is\nJune 30, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, the balance of\n80\nTable of Contents\nthe 2024 Notes was $11,950,000. On November 13, 2024, we made an optional prepayment of $2,000,000 on the 2024 Notes reducing the outstanding balance\nto $9,950,000.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company debt service and other cash requirements,\nwe will seek to obtain additional financing.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nNine Months ended September 30, 2024 2023\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 34,959,578 $ (15,754,344)\nInvesting activities (9,218,359) 19,755,073\nFinancing activities (957,419) (825,988)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents 24,783,800 3,174,741\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 8,976,998 11,958,228\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 33,760,798 $ 15,132,969\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $34,960,000 in Nine Months 2024 as compared to $15,754,000 used in operating activities in Nine\nMonths 2023. The $50,714,000 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in Nine Months 2024 as compared to Nine Months 2023 was primarily\nthe result of an increase in net income from net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of $26,502,000 and in cash provided arising from net fluctuations in\noperating assets and liabilities. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as affected by growth or declines in its\noperations, payments on claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9,218,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $19,755,000 provided by investing activities in Nine Months\n2023 resulting in a $28,973,000 increase in net cash used in investing activities. In Nine Months 2024, we had net cash used by our investment portfolio of\n$7,479,000, compared to $21,135,000 provided in Nine Months 2023.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $957,000 in Nine Months 2024 compared to $826,000 used in Nine Months 2023. Net cash used in financing\nactivities are primarily principal payments of $5,000,000 on our 2022 Notes, $3,000,000 on our 2024 Notes, and $859,000 on our equipment financing debt in\nconnection with KICO’s sale-leaseback transaction. In addition, we paid $961,000 for withholding taxes on vested restricted stock awards. The principal\npayments on the 2024 Notes were made by using a portion of the $9,066,000 net proceeds from our ATM offering.\nReinsurance\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consisted of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27%\nquota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”).\nOur excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties expired on June 30, 2024 and we entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance\ntreaties effective July 1, 2024 (as discussed below). Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying\nXOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance coverage for losses\nof $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the Underlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL\nTreaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. Effective January 1, 2024, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed\ncovering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025. Effective July 1, 2024, we purchased $275,000,000 of catastrophe reinsurance in excess of\n$5,000,000, compared to $315,000,000 of catastrophe reinsurance in excess of $10,000,000 in the expiring treaty. Our ability to reduce\n81\nTable of Contents\nthe top limit of our catastrophe reinsurance was due to our tightened underwriting as discussed above and curtailing new business growth through June 30,\n2024, which reduced our probable maximum loss. Effective July 1, 2024, we renewed our excess of loss treaty with the same terms as the expiring treaty.\nMaterial terms for our reinsurance treaties in effect for the treaty years shown below are as follows:\nTreaty Period\n2024/2025 Treaty 2023/2024 Treaty 2021/2023 Treaty\nJanuary 2, July 1, January 1, July 1, January 1, July 1, December 31,\n2025 2024 2024 2023 2023 2022 2021\nto to to to to to to\nJune 30, January 1, June 30, January 1, June 30, January 1, June 30,\nLine of Business 2025 2025 2024 2024 2023 2023 2022\nPersonal Lines:\nHomeowners, dwelling fire and canine legal\nliability Quota share treaty:\nPercent ceded (7) (6) 27 % 27 % 30 % 30 % 30 % 30 %\nRisk retained on initial $1,000,000 of\nlosses (5) (6) (7) $ 1,000,000 $ 730,000 $ 730,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000\nLosses per occurrence subject to quota\nshare reinsurance coverage (6) $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000\nExpiration date (6) January 1, 2025 January 1, 2025 January 1, 2024 January 1, 2024 January 1, 2023 January 1, 2023\nExcess of loss coverage and facultative\nfacility coverage (1) (5) (6) $ 8,000,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000\nin excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of\n$ 1,000,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000\nTotal reinsurance coverage per\noccurrence (5) (6) $ 8,000,000 $ 8,470,000 $ 8,470,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000\nLosses per occurrence subject to\nreinsurance coverage (6) $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000\nExpiration date (6) June 30, 2025 June 30, 2025 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nCatastrophe Reinsurance:\nInitial loss subject to personal lines quota\nshare treaty (6) (6) $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000\nRisk retained per catastrophe occurrence\n(6) (7) (8) (9) 5,000,000 4,750,000 $ 9,500,000 $ 8,750,000 $ 8,750,000 $ 7,400,000 $ 7,400,000\nCatastrophe loss coverage in excess of\nquota share coverage (2) (6) $ 275,000,000 $ 275,000,000 $ 315,000,000 $ 315,000,000 $ 335,000,000 $ 335,000,000 $ 490,000,000\nReinstatement premium protection (3)\n(4) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\n(1) For personal lines, includes the addition of an automatic facultative facility allowing KICO to obtain homeowners single risk coverage up to\n$9,000,000 in total insured value, which covers direct losses from $3,500,000 to $9,000,000 through June 30, 2025.\n(2) Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts.

Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to\nbe higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nWhile the rate of inflation has moderated in 2024, Three Months 2024 and Nine Months 2024 still include the continuing effects of prior years’\neconomic inflation, which resulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower public equity valuations, and significant\nfinancial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads reduced the value of our fixed income securities in prior quarters. In Three\nMonths 2024 and Nine Months 2024, the volatility surrounding lowered interest rates and inflation increased our stockholders’ equity. For Three Months 2024\nand Nine Months 2024, the continuing effects of prior economic inflation impacted our loss and loss\n83\nTable of Contents\nadjustment expenses as well; should these inflationary trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively impact our results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return.\nOn August 2, 2024, two large competitors announced a plan to wind down their personal lines operations in New York State and to non-renew or mid-\nterm cancel their entire book of business before year end 2024. The policyholders of such competitors will need to find alternative coverage. Our producers\nhave been placing a sizable number of these policies with KICO. As such, we anticipate the sizeable increase in our policies in force and direct written\npremium to continue for the remainder of the year.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to assure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were: (i) effective in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\n85\nTable of Contents\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on\nthis evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of\nSeptember 30, 20244.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Golden - Chief Executive Officer\nJennifer Gravelle - Chief Financial Officer\nSarah Chen - Chief Actuary\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nKarin Daly\nVice President\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nkdaly@equityny.com\nDEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES 22\nDirect premiums written represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period.\nNet premiums written are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the\nfiscal period presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct\npremiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP\nmeasure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of\ndebt, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall\nprofitability.\nOperating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures\nmost closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company’s\noverall profitability.\nOperating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share are the GAAP\nmeasures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may\nvary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the\nCompany’s overall profitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating\nreturn on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company’s overall return on average common equity.\nUnderlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss and less the effect of prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s\nloss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately\nwhen reviewing the Company’s underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company’s net loss ratio.\nNet loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s net loss ratios to vary significantly between\nperiods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company’s\nunderwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio.

(Nasdaq:KINS) (the \"Company\" or \"Kingstone\"), a Northeast regional property and casualty insurance holding company, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company will hold its second quarter 2024 financial results conference call on Tuesday, August 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

This performance was enhanced by favorable weather conditions and the accelerating reduction of our non-core business.\n\n\"Core business direct premiums written increased by nearly 22% during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven primarily by continued increases in average premium and strengthened through a modest expansion of our underwriting appetite. Since then, we are capitalizing on new business opportunities resulting from recent changes in the New York competitive landscape and anticipate even more robust policy and premium growth moving forward.\n\n\"Our underlying loss ratio improved by 14.6 points in the second quarter as compared to the comparable 2023 quarter due to both lower frequency and severity. The absence of severe weather conditions throughout the quarter benefited our catastrophe loss ratio by 3.4 points compared to the previous year, and we experienced modest favorable prior year reserve development. Furthermore, our expense management efforts reduced our expense ratio by 1.3 points from the comparable period last year. These factors led to a net combined ratio of 78.2% for the second quarter, marking a 20.7 point improvement from the prior year period.\"\n\nMs. Golden concluded, \"Following unprecedented performance in the first six months and the increasing growth prospects for our business, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance and providing initial full-year 2025 guidance. We are committed to delivering sustainable long-term shareholder value.\"\n\n**Guidance**(see \"Disclaimer and Forward-Looking Statements\" below)\n\nFor 2024, the Company's current full year expectations are calculated based on anticipated net premiums earned of approximately $125 million, and are as follows:\n\n**Guidance Metrics**| **2024 - Current**|  _**2024 - Previous**_  \n---|---|---  \nCore Business2 direct premiums written growth| 25% to 35%| _16% to 20%_  \nCombined ratio| 84% to 88%| _86% to 90%_  \nNet income per share - basic*| $ 1.00 to $1.30| $ _0.75 to $1.10_  \nReturn on equity| 26% to 34%| _22% to 30%_  \n  \nFor 2025, the Company's full year expectations are calculated based on anticipated net premiums earned of approximately $150 million, and are as follows:\n\n**Guidance Metrics**| **2025**  \n---|---  \nCore Business2 direct premiums written growth| 15% to 25%  \nCombined ratio| 85% to 89%  \nNet income per share - basic*| $ 1.20 to $1.60  \nReturn on equity| 22% to 30%  \n  \n_*The variance between net income per share - diluted and basic is immaterial.

The actual results may be materially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in this press release and in Kingstone's annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission._\n\n_This press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. For more details on factors that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023._\n\n_The risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following:_\n\n  * _the risk of significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events;_\n\n  * _risks related to the lack of a financial strength rating from A.M. Best;_\n\n  * _risks related to our indebtedness due on December 30, 2024, including due to the need to comply with certain financial covenants and limitations on the ability of our insurance subsidiary to pay dividends to us;_\n\n  * _adverse capital, credit and financial market conditions;_\n\n  * _the unavailability of reinsurance at current levels and prices;_\n\n  * _the exposure to greater net insurance losses in the event of reduced reliance on reinsurance;_\n\n  * _the credit risk of our reinsurers;_\n\n  * _the inability to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital needed to grow our business;_\n\n  * _the effects of climate change on the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires;_\n\n  * _risks related to the limited market area of our business;_\n\n  * _risks related to a concentration of business in a limited number of producers;_\n\n  * _legislative and regulatory changes, including changes in insurance laws and regulations and their application by our regulators;_\n\n  * _limitations with regard to our ability to pay dividends;_\n\n  * _the effects of competition in our market areas;_\n\n  * _our reliance on certain key personnel;_\n\n  * _risks related to security breaches or other attacks involving our computer systems or those of our vendors; and_\n\n  *  _our reliance on information technology and information systems._\n\n\n\n\n_Kingstone undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law._\n\n_**Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures**_\n\n _**_Direct premiums written_** represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period._\n\n_**_Net premiums written_** are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company's policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results. Direct premiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company's net premiums earned._\n\n_**_Adjusted EBITDA_** is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA._\n\n_Management uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share_** is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share._\n\n_Management uses operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share_** is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share_\n\n _Management uses operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the Company's overall profitability._\n\n_**_Operating return on equity_** is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity._\n\n_Management uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company's overall return on average common equity._\n\n_**_Underlying loss ratio_** is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio less the effect of prior year loss reserve development and catastrophes losses._\n\n_Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company's loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company's net loss ratio._\n\n_**_Net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes_** is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio._\n\n_Management believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company's business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company's net loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company's underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nKingstone Companies, Inc. (referred to herein as \"Kingstone\" or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), underwrites property and casualty insurance exclusively. KICO is\na New York domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, 95.9% and 88.6%,\nrespectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, 95.2% and 87.8%,\nrespectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. Kingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc.\n(“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these\nagencies.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The principles for condensed interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited by\nan independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) but, in the\nopinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of\nthe Company’s financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 may not be\nindicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nComponents of ceded premiums written within prior year net earned premiums in Note 6 were reclassified to conform with an elected change in the prior year\npresentation during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, by recording ceded written premiums for the 12 months of the contract term at inception, rather than\nmonthly over the contract term, providing a full disclosure of the premiums ceded. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 2 – Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation; Going Concern\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further\ninformation.\nThe Company’s $19,950,000 Notes Payable (the “2022 Notes”) are due on December 30, 2024. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent\non its ability to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy such obligation. Management believes that KICO’s insurance operations would be able to\ncontinue in the unlikely event that financing is not obtained.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company\nhas the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they\nbecome due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation requires management to perform two steps. First,\nmanagement must evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nSecond, if management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is required to consider whether it has plans in place to alleviate that doubt.\nDisclosures in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements are required if management concludes that substantial doubt exists or that its plans\nalleviate the substantial doubt that was raised.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP assuming that the Company will continue as a\ngoing concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or\nthe amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement’s Plan Related to Going Concern\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy its debt obligation on December 30, 2024.\nManagement plans to refinance the 2022 Notes with a new issue of equity securities and/or debt securities that would result in net proceeds in an amount\nsufficient to satisfy the amounts due under the 2022 Notes. In connection therewith, the Company may utilize investment bankers to serve as underwriters or\nplacement agents for proposed offerings by the Company of its securities (including debt, common and/or preferred securities). The Company, subject to\nregulatory approval, may receive distributions paid to it by KICO, its insurance subsidiary, that could be utilized to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. Further,\nthe Company may also use available invested assets and cash to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. As of June 30, 2024, invested assets and cash of the\nHolding Company available for such purpose was approximately $2,716,000.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described above. The Company\nbelieves that its plan is probable of being implemented and that such plan would alleviate any adverse conditions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and includes the reserves for losses and\nloss adjustment expense (“LAE”), which are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be\nreported and settled over a period of many years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with loss and LAE recoverable under reinsurance contracts\nand other receivables or payable under reinsurance contracts related to contingent ceding commission revenue require judgments by management. On an\nongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating these estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from the\nestimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, CMIC Properties, Inc. (“Properties”) and 15 Joys Lane, LLC (“15 Joys Lane”), which together own the land and building from which KICO\noperates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-\n09”), which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid.

The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to\nbe collected and the amortized cost basis, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company considers all available\nevidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded, which is recognized in net loss through an\nallowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nThe Company did not identify any available-for-sale securities as of June 30, 2024 which presented a risk of loss due to credit deterioration of the security.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 138 and 140 fixed-maturity securities, respectively, that accounted for the gross unrealized losses. The\nCompany determined that none of the unrealized losses were deemed to be credit losses for its portfolio of investments for the six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023. Significant factors influencing the Company’s determination that unrealized losses were temporary included credit quality considerations, the\nmagnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and interest rate environment factors, and management’s\nintent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery of estimated fair value to the Company’s cost basis.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at June 30, 2024 as follows:\nJune 30, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ - $ - - $ 5,979,360 (17,340) 1 $ 5,979,360 $ (17,340)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,169,433 (3,337,986) 12 13,169,433 (3,337,986)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 66,247,579 (5,850,585) 80 66,247,579 (5,850,585)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 114,017 (1,377) 6 37,025,197 (6,881,211) 39 37,139,214 (6,882,588)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $ 114,017 $ (1,377) 6 $122,421,569 $(16,087,122) 132 $122,535,586 $(16,088,499)\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at December 31, 2023 as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $5,974,440 $ (17,373) 1 $ - - - $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,398,552 (3,209,161) 13 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 70,107,746 (5,885,296) 85 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 88,988 (2,144) 4 38,675,604 (6,541,731) 37 38,764,592 (6,543,875)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $6,063,428 $ (19,517) 5 $122,181,902 $(15,636,188) 135 $128,245,330 $(15,655,705)\n18\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s investments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 indicating the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\nJune 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 40,715,110 $ - $ - $ 40,715,110\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,254,433 - 13,254,433\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 66,247,578 - - 66,247,578\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 40,730,146 - 40,730,146\nTotal fixed maturities 106,962,688 53,984,579 - 160,947,267\nEquity securities 11,428,238 - - 11,428,238\nTotal investments, at fair value $ 118,390,926 $ 53,984,579 $ - $ 172,375,505\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 20,939,190 $ - $ - $ 20,939,190\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,398,552 - 13,398,552\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 70,107,746 - - 70,107,746\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 44,475,309 - 44,475,309\nTotal fixed maturities 91,046,936 57,873,861 - 148,920,797\nEquity securities 14,762,340 - - 14,762,340\nTotal investments, at fair value $ 105,809,276 $ 57,873,861 $ - $ 163,683,137\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s investment in a hedge fund measured at Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share as of June 30, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $996,155 favorable and $19,253 favorable, respectively. Management, on a quarterly basis, performs\na review of open liability claims to assess carried case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve levels, giving consideration to both Company and\nindustry trends.\nLoss and LAE Reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\n22\nTable of Contents\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where\nan unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods – historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate\nestimate of IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\n23\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\nIn New York State, lawsuits for negligence are subject to certain limitations and must be commenced within three years from the date of the accident or are\notherwise barred. Accordingly, the Company’s exposure to unreported claims (“pure” IBNR) for accident dates of June 30, 2021 and prior is limited, although\nthere remains the possibility of adverse development on reported claims (“case development” IBNR). In certain rare circumstances states have retroactively\nrevised a statute of limitations. The Company is not aware of any such effort that would have a material impact on the Company’s results.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of June 30, 2024, net of reinsurance, as well as the cumulative reported claims by\naccident year and total IBNR reserves as of June 30, 2024 included in the net incurred loss and allocated expense amounts.

For the 2024/2025 Treaty, 22% of\nthe 27% total of losses ceded under this treaty are excluded from a named catastrophe event.\n(8) Plus losses in excess of catastrophe coverage\n27\nTable of Contents\nTreaty Year\nJuly 1, 2023 July 1, 2022\nto to\nLine of Business June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nPersonal Lines:\nPersonal Umbrella\nQuota share treaty:\nPercent ceded - first $1,000,000 of coverage 90% 90%\nPercent ceded - excess of $1,000,000 dollars of coverage 95% 95%\nRisk retained $ 300,000 $ 300,000\nTotal reinsurance coverage per occurrence $ 4,700,000 $ 4,700,000\nLosses per occurrence subject to quota share reinsurance coverage $ 5,000,000 $ 5,000,000\nExpiration date June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nCommercial Lines (1)\n(1) Coverage on all commercial lines policies expired in September 2020; reinsurance coverage is based on treaties in effect on the date of loss.\nThe Company’s reinsurance program has been structured to enable the Company to grow its premium volume while maintaining regulatory capital and other\nfinancial ratios generally within or below the expected ranges used for regulatory oversight purposes. The reinsurance program also provides income as a result\nof ceding commissions earned pursuant to the quota share reinsurance contracts. The Company’s participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve the\nCompany of its obligations to policyholders.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe Company earned ceding commission revenue under the 2024/2025 Treaty for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and under the 2023/2024 Treaty for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2023, based on a fixed provisional commission rate at which provisional ceding commissions are earned. The Company earned\nceding commission revenue under its quota share reinsurance agreements that expired prior to the 2021/2023 Treaty based on: (i) a fixed provisional\ncommission rate at which provisional ceding commissions were earned, and (ii) under certain of the quota share reinsurance agreements, a continuing sliding\nscale of commission rates and ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each of these agreements based upon which contingent ceding\ncommissions are earned. The sliding scale includes minimum and maximum commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. The commission rate\nand contingent ceding commissions earned increase when the estimated ultimate loss ratio decreases and, conversely, the commission rate and contingent\nceding commissions earned decrease when the estimated ultimate loss ratio increases.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCeding commission revenue consists of the following:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,561,998 $ 5,294,025 $ 9,117,238 $ 10,740,833\nContingent ceding commissions earned (37) 118,185 11,834 116,784\n$ 4,561,961 $ 5,412,210 $ 9,129,072 $ 10,857,617\nProvisional ceding commissions are settled monthly. Balances due from reinsurers for contingent ceding commissions on quota share treaties are settled\nperiodically based on the Loss Ratio of each treaty year that ends on June 30, for the expired treaties that were subject to contingent commissions. As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net contingent ceding commissions payable to\nreinsurers under all treaties was approximately $723,000 and $3,302,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 7 – Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nIn July 2017, KICO became a member of, and invested in, the FHLBNY. KICO is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of FHLBNY. Based\non redemption provisions of FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, FHLBNY may declare dividends on the\nstock. Management reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no\nimpairment has been recognized. FHLBNY members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling\nmembers to customize advances, which are to be fully collateralized. Eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account\navailable for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the previous quarter. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew\nKICO’s ratings as KICO requested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO\nis currently only able to borrow on an overnight basis. If KICO has sufficient available collateral (as discussed below), based on KICO’s net admitted assets,\nthe maximum allowable advance as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $12,692,000 and $12,813,000, respectively. Available\ncollateral as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $10,626,000 and $11,412,000, respectively. Advances are limited to 85% of the\namount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n29\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nDebt as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists of the following:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n2022 Notes, net $ 19,020,085 $ 18,426,247\nEquipment financing 6,248,779 6,817,283\nBalance at end of period $ 25,268,864 $ 25,243,530\nNote and Warrant Exchange Agreement\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “Exchanging\nNoteholders”) of the Company’s outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging\nNoteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes then\noutstanding. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on December 15, 2022, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for the\nfollowing: (i) new 12.0% Senior Notes due December 30, 2024 of the Company in the aggregate approximate principal amount of $19,950,000 (the “2022\nNotes”); (ii) cash in the aggregate approximate amount of $1,595,000, together with accrued interest on the 2017 Notes; and (iii) three-year warrants for the\npurchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock of the Company, exercisable at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (the “Warrants”). The\nremaining $8,455,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, together with accrued interest thereon, was paid on the maturity date of the 2017 Notes of December\n30, 2022.\n2022 Notes\nAs discussed above, on December 15, 2022, the Company issued the 2022 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $19,950,000 pursuant to the Exchange\nAgreement. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year, which commenced on June 30, 2023 at the rate of 12.0% per\nannum. Warrants were issued with a fair value of $993,200 (see Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity) and transaction costs were $1,758,112, for an effective yield of\n13.92% per annum. The balance of the 2022 Notes as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\n12.0% Senior Unsecured Notes $ 19,950,000 $ 19,950,000\nWarrants (489,842) (653,123)\nIssuance costs (440,073) (870,630)\n2022 Notes, net $ 19,020,085 $ 18,426,247\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe Exchange Agreement provided for a mandatory redemption of the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023, in an amount such that the aggregate principal\namount of the 2022 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon was to be equal to the amount by which the maximum Ordinary Dividend\nPaying Capacity of KICO (as defined below) measured as of December 15, 2023 exceeded the Company’s Holding Company Expenses (as defined below) for\nthe calendar year ended December 31, 2023. “Ordinary Dividend Paying Capacity” means the sum, as measured on December 15, 2023, of (i) the maximum\nallowable amount of dividends that KICO is permitted to pay without seeking any regulatory approval in accordance with New York insurance regulations\nbased on its statutory annual and quarterly financial statements filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as of and for the thirty-six (36)\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023 plus (ii) any dividends paid by KICO to the Company during the period beginning January 1, 2023 and ending\nSeptember 30, 2023. “Holding Company Expenses” means the sum of (i) cash interest expense paid during the calendar year ended December 31, 2023 on the\n2022 Notes, intercompany loans and any other indebtedness of the Holding Company on a stand-alone basis and (ii) other cash operating expenses, including\ntaxes, paid by the Holding Company during the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. The amount of other operating expenses paid in cash in the preceding\nclause (ii) shall not exceed $2.5 million. Holding Company Expenses was determined based on the actual Holding Company Expenses for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023, and an estimate of Holding Company Expenses for the three months ended December 30, 2023. The Ordinary Dividend Paying\nCapacity of KICO as defined above as of December 31, 2023 was zero and, accordingly, the Company was not required to make a mandatory redemption of\nthe 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023.\nThe 2022 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not the obligations of or guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes\nrank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated or junior in right of\npayment to the 2022 Notes. The Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness, but are effectively\nsubordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. In addition, the 2022 Notes are\nstructurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe 2022 Notes are redeemable, at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time or in part from time to time, on and after December 30, 2022, upon\nnot less than fifteen (15) and not more than sixty (60) days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (“Redemption Prices” ) (expressed as percentages of the\nprincipal amount thereof) if redeemed during the respective period set forth below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of\nredemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date):\nPeriod: Percentage\nDecember 30, 2022 to December 29, 2023 102.00%\nDecember 30, 2023 to September 29, 2024 101.00%\nSeptember 30, 2024 to December 29, 2024 100.00%\nManagement plans to refinance the 2022 Notes with a new issue of equity securities and/or debt securities in an amount sufficient to satisfy the amounts due\nunder the 2022 Notes. In connection therewith, the Company may utilize investment bankers to serve as underwriters or placement agents for proposed\nofferings by the Company of its securities (including debt, common and/or preferred securities). The Company, subject to regulatory approval, may receive\ndistributions paid to it by KICO, its insurance subsidiary, that could be utilized to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. Further, the Company may also use\navailable invested assets and cash to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. As of June 30, 2024, invested assets and cash of the Holding Company available for\nsuch purpose was approximately $2,716,000.\nAs of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the Company is subject to a leverage maintenance\ntest (“Leverage Maintenance Test”), which requires that the Total Consolidated Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company not be greater than 30% of\nTotal Consolidated Capitalization (as defined below). As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ratio as defined under the Leverage Maintenance Test\nwas 27.2% and 29.9%, respectively. “Total Consolidated Indebtedness” is the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any Indebtedness\nissued with more than de minimis original issue discount) of all outstanding long-term debt of the Company except for the sale- leaseback transaction described\nbelow under “Equipment Financing”, any refinancing or any future sale-leaseback transaction. “Total Consolidated Capitalization” is the amount equal to the\nsum of (x) Total Consolidated Indebtedness outstanding as of such date and (y) the total consolidated shareholders’ equity of the Company, excluding\naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, as recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEquipment Financing\nOn October 27, 2022, KICO entered into a sale-leaseback transaction, whereby KICO sold $8,096,824 of fixed assets to a bank. Under GAAP, the sale-\nleaseback transaction is recorded as equipment financing (“Financing”). The provisions of the Financing require KICO to pay a monthly payment of principal\nand interest at the rate of 5.86% per annum totaling $126,877 for a term of 60 months, which commenced on October 27, 2022. The terms of the Financing\nprovide buyout options to KICO at the end of the 60 month term, which are as follows:\n· At the end of the lease, KICO may purchase the fixed assets for a purchase price of $2,024,206, which is 25% of the original fixed asset cost of\n$8,096,824; or\n· KICO may renew the lease for 16 months at the same rental rate, which totals $2,030,036.\nA provision of the Financing requires KICO to pledge collateral for the lease obligation. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of required\ncollateral was approximately $6,153,000 and $6,999,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was approximately\n$12,581,000, consisting of approximately $11,934,000 in United States Treasury securities and the remaining balance of $647,000 in cash. As of December 31,\n2023, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was approximately $11,960,000 in United States Treasury securities.\nFuture contractual payment obligations under the Financing as of June 30, 2024 are as follows:\nFor the Years Ending December 31, Total\nRemainder of 2024 $ 585,358\n2025 1,223,293\n2026 1,296,901\n2027 1,119,021\n4,224,573\n2027 purchase price 2,024,206\nTotal $ 6,248,779\nNote 8 – Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends Declared and Paid\nOn November 11, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends. Future dividend policy will be subject to the\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n32\nTable of Contents\n2014 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which a maximum of 700,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses. Incentive stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\n(except no later than five years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan,\nsubject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. On August 5, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan, including an increase in\nthe maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,400,000. On August 9, 2023,\nthe Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are\nauthorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,900,000. The 2014 Plan terminated on August 12, 2024 and no further awards may be granted under the\n2014 Plan after such date.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were 128,037 shares reserved for grants under the 2014 Plan.\n2024 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 7, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2024 Equity Participation Plan (see Note 13 - Subsequent Events)\nStock Options\nThe results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include stock-based compensation expense for stock options totaling\napproximately $53,000 and $-0-, respectively. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include stock-based\ncompensation expense for stock options totaling approximately $106,000 and $-0-, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2024 is net of estimated forfeitures of approximately 12%. Such amounts have been included in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other operating expenses.\nThe weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $1.24 per share. No options were granted\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023. The fair value of stock options at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The\nBlack-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully\ntransferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the\nCompany’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can\nmaterially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of\nthe Company’s stock options.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for grants during the following periods:\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nDividend Yield 0.00% n/a\nVolatility 74.72% n/a\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 4.17% n/a\nExpected Life 3.50 years n/a\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Price Contractual Aggregate\nStock Options Shares per Share Term Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 107,201 $ 8.31 0.94 $ -\nGranted 318,750 $ 2.25 4.63 $ 876,563\nExercised - $ - - $ -\nExpired/Forfeited (38,750) $ 2.25 4.72 $ 73,913\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 387,201 $ 3.93 3.37 $ 770,000\nVested and Exercisable at June 30, 2024 107,201 $ 8.31 0.42 $ -\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at June 30, 2024 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the\nunderlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $5.00 closing price\nof the Company’s Common Stock on June 30, 2024. The total intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture. The total\nintrinsic value of options when expired are determined as of the date of expiration.\nParticipants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise\nissuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised, or by exchanging a number of shares owned\nfor a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of unamortized compensation cost related to 280,000 unvested stock option awards was approximately $192,000.\nUnamortized compensation cost as of June 30, 2024 is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.52 years.\n34\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the restricted Common Stock activity under the 2014 Plan for six months ended June 30, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nValue per Aggregate\nRestricted Stock Awards Shares Share Fair Value\nBalance at January 1, 2024 550,581 $ 3.82 $ 2,103,219\nGranted 178,459 $ 2.33 $ 416,211\nVested (234,653) $ 1.86 $ (436,455)\nForfeited (1,900) $ 4.80 $ (9,120)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 492,487 $ 4.21 $ 2,073,370\nFair value was calculated using the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date. For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023,\nstock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $228,000 and $212,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, stock-\nbased compensation for these grants was approximately $441,000 and $429,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). These amounts reflect the Company’s accounting expense\nand do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the directors, executives and employees.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the Exchange Agreement (see Note 7 – Debt – “Note and Warrant Exchange”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants to the Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. The fair value of the warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes. The fair value of the warrants is being\namortized over the life of the warrants, which is 36.5 months.\nThe warrants are exercisable through December 30, 2025 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the warrants may exercise their outstanding\nwarrants in cash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market\nvalue equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised.\nAs of June 30, 2024, all warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\n35\nTable of Contents\nShelf Registration\nOn April 5, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with regard to the\nregistration of $50,000,000 of its equity and debt securities (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by\nthe SEC on April 22, 2024. Pursuant to the requirements of Form S-3, the Company currently may sell pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, during\nany 12 month period, equity securities having an aggregate market value of no more than one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares of its Common\nStock held by non-affiliates. Any offering made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement may only be made by means of a prospectus, including a\nprospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective Shelf Registration Statement, relating to the offering.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nIn May 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which the Company currently has\nthe ability to issue and sell shares of its Common Stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, up to an\naggregate offering price of approximately $16,400,000 in what is commonly referred to as an “at-the-market” (“ATM”) program. During the three months\nended June 30, 2024, the Company sold 56,109 shares of its Common Stock at a weighted average price of $4.84 per share and raised $167,629 in net proceeds\nunder the ATM program. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $16,128,423 of Common Stock under the ATM\nprogram.\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly-owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\n36\nTable of Contents\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 3,183,385 $ 5,283,016\nClaims reserve discount 1,191,193 1,204,334\nUnearned premium 3,647,887 2,742,603\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 1,948,187 1,986,782\nNet unrealized losses on securities 3,119,422 3,357,463\nOther 1,132,771 1,153,903\nTotal deferred tax assets 14,222,845 15,728,101\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,110,700 4,158,538\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 186,011 153,201\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,161,254 5,176,282\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 9,061,591 $ 10,551,819\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers (“NOL”) are as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\nType of NOL 2024 2023 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2022-2024 $ 3,183,385 $ 5,283,016 None\nState only (A) 2,752,386 2,560,372 December 2027 - December 2044\nValuation allowance (2,752,386) (2,560,372)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 3,183,385 $ 5,283,016\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of June 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023 was approximately $42,344,000 and $39,390,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting subsidiary, is not subject to state\nincome taxes. KICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of\ngenerating enough state taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs over their remaining lives, which expire between 2027 and 2044.\n(2) Deferred tax liability – Investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as\nCommercial Mutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property and\ncasualty insurance company. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in consideration for the\nexchange of $3,750,000 principal amount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and unpaid interest on the surplus\nnotes as of the date of conversion. As of the date of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along with the accretion of the discount on\nthe original purchase of the surplus notes totaled $2,921,319 (together “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of acquisition, the deferred tax liability on the\nUntaxed Interest was $1,169,000. A temporary difference with an indefinite life exists when the parent has a lower carrying value of its subsidiary for\nincome tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was reduced to $759,543 upon the reduction of federal income tax rates as of December 31, 2017. The\nCompany is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of $759,543 related to this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is sold, or the assets of\nKICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. If any had been recognized these would have\nbeen reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022 remain subject to examination.\nNote 10 – Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock\noutstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise\nof stock options and warrants as well as non-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes those\noptions and warrants with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented. For the three\nmonths and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were 107,201 options with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company’s\nCommon Stock during the periods. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no warrants with an exercise price in excess of the\naverage market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods.\nThe computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where\nthe exercise of such options and warrants or vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the three months and six months ended June 30,\n2023, no options, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have been anti-dilutive\nfor the relevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per common share has\nnot been adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share\nfollows:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30 June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 11,019,347 10,755,848 11,009,442 10,753,974\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options 84,476 - 55,243 -\nWarrants 651,681 - 608,598 -\nRestricted stock awards 355,442 - 314,693 -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding,\nused for computing diluted earning (loss) per share 12,110,946 10,755,848 11,987,976 10,753,974\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy. Such proceedings are considered\nin estimating the liability for loss and LAE expenses.\nOffice Lease\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business. These leases are accounted\nfor as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company was a party to a non-cancellable operating lease, dated March 27, 2015, for its office facility for KICO located in Valley Stream, New York,\nwhich expired on March 31, 2024.

Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies\nare written for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nJune 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of June 30, 2024, these expired policies represent\napproximately 15.2% of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional Financial Information”.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering\nits business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and\nnet underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income,\nand may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other\nfactors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to\nmateriality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not\nmaterialize.\n47\nTable of Contents\nApplication of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies.\nSee below a description of these critical accounting estimates. Also see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nProperty and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling both reported\n(“case”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and claims adjusting expenses. The liability for these reserves is estimated on an undiscounted basis,\nusing individual case-basis valuations and paid claims, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies. Due to the inherent\nuncertainty of the reserve process, actual loss costs could vary significantly compared to estimated loss costs. The below table provides detail of our reserves\nas of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of As of\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n($ in thousands) Gross Ceded Net Gross Ceded Net\nCase loss $ 57,369 $ 14,290 $ 43,079 $ 67,108 $ 19,538 $ 47,570\nCase LAE 6,357 1,189 5,168 5,726 1,121 4,605\nIBNR loss 39,373 11,149 28,224 37,262 10,665 26,597\nIBNR LAE 13,478 2,386 11,092 11,722 1,965 9,757\nTotal $ 116,577 $ 29,014 $ 87,563 $ 121,818 $ 33,289 $ 88,529\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nCase Reserves – Reserves for reported losses are based on an estimate of ultimate loss costs of an individual claim derived from individual case-basis\nvaluations, actual claims paid, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies.\nIBNR Reserves – IBNR reserves are estimates of claims that have occurred but as to which we have not yet been notified to establish the case\nreserve. IBNR is determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance and adjusted to current conditions.\nReinsurance\nWe purchase reinsurance to manage our underwriting risk on certain policies. Reinsurance receivables represent management’s best estimate of loss\nand LAE recoverable from reinsurers. Reinsurance receivables are estimated using the same methodologies as loss and LAE reserves. Changes in the methods\nand assumptions used could result in significant variances between actual and estimated losses.\n48\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on GAAP income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Changes in\nestimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) could result in significant changes to our\ndeferred tax asset or liability.\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences which result in differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. These assets and liabilities are carried at the enacted tax rates expected to apply when\nthe asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in estimates and assumptions in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss), or changes in the enacted tax rate, could result in significant variances between our carried deferred tax and tax recognized on\nthe recovery or settlement of the asset or liability.\nInvestments\nBonds are classified as held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”), and stocks are generally classified as AFS. Investments classified as\nHTM are carried at amortized cost, which requires very little judgement. Investments classified as AFS are generally carried at fair value with an unrealized\ngain/loss recorded in income. Actual results could vary significantly from the fair values recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nKingstone 2.0 (completed) and Kingstone 3.0 (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0”, were commenced to modernize our company. The\npillars of the new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthened the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse backgrounds;\n2. Reduced expenses and increased efficiency by embracing technology, including converting to a new policy management system, retiring multiple\nlegacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Developed and implemented a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk using advanced\nanalytics and an abundance of data; and\n4. Better managed our catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our probable maximum loss (“PML”) in order to\nmitigate the impact of the then emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we\ncoined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results, by stopping\nnew business, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory constraints. We have been aggressively reducing\npolicy count. Our request to withdraw from the state of New Jersey was acknowledged in October 2023 and all remaining policies will be non-\nrenewed over a two year period starting January 1, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, our non-Core policy count was down by 55.0% compared to June\n30, 2023;\n49\nTable of Contents\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported in each state\nand product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value. Inflation has been a dominant headwind that is showing signs of stabilizing. We\nhave been cognizant that inflation’s impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and, as such, we have been more frequent and\naggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that same inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we\ncompleted our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes were insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums\nattributable to the heightened replacement costs. All policies are renewed at the at the most current replacement cost. Overall average written\npremium for our legacy Core homeowners policies for the last 12 months, reflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 24.1%;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML. We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the required limit to be purchased\nwhile maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new business that was deemed to be too expensive and at\nthe same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the greatest risk. The combination of stricter new business underwriting\nand increased non-renewals gave rise to the 4.6% decline in policy count for our Core business. We have now reverted most of our new business\nunderwriting standards back to what they were previously so Core new business growth should increase going forward; and\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net underwriting expense ratio to 29% by year-end 2024. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we achieved our goal of 33%, with a net underwriting expense ratio of 32.9%. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the\nnet underwriting expense ratio was 31.3%, a reduction of 2.3 points compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023 but higher than our goal due\nto a higher accrual for employee bonuses and contingent commissions for producers to reflect greater profitability than originally projected.\nWe believe that the above actions taken resulted in our return to profitability for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024, will continue\nto have the intended effect and will continue through the remainder 2024 to result in a return to annual profitability.\n50\nTable of Contents\nSee the tables below for our Core and non-Core business for policies in force as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 and direct written premiums for the three\nmonths and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

The increase of $7,576,000, or 8.0%, was primarily due to an increase in premiums from our personal lines\nbusiness.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Six Months 2024 were $95,877,000, an increase of $7,695,000, or 8.7%, from\n$88,182,000 in Six Months 2023. The 8.7% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the increase in premiums associated\nwith our Core business of 18.8% offsetting a 57.5% decrease in our non-Core business. The increase in our Core business premiums and the decrease in our\nnon-Core business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Six Months 2024 were $6,900,000, a decrease of $116,000, or 1.7%, from\n$7,016,000 in Six Months 2023. The decrease in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an underwriting restriction in place to exclude\ncertain electric vehicles until the approval of adequate rate for the risk was received, which happened in July 2024. The decrease was offset by an increase in\nthe values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $97,893,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $83,639,000 in Six Months 2023, an increase of\n$14,254,000, or 17.0%. The increase in direct written premiums from our Core business was due to rate increases, offset by a decrease in policies in force.\nPolicies in force from our Core business decreased by 4.6% in Six Months 2024 compared to Six Months 2023. Direct written premiums from our non-Core\nbusiness were $4,927,000 in Six Months 2024 down from $11,605,000 in Six Months 2023, a decrease of $6,678,000, or 57.5%. The decrease in direct written\npremiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force from our non-\nCore business decreased by 55.0% in Six Months 2024 compared to Six Months 2023. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in our non-Core\nbusiness is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n54\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums increased $11,923,000, or 17.6%, to $79,520,000 in Six Months 2024 from $67,597,000 in Six Months 2023. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe increase in Six Months 2024 is primarily due to changes to our personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty. See quota share reinsurance treaties\ndiscussion below.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nOn January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1,\n2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”). Our personal lines\nbusiness was subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty in Six Months 2024, and the 2023/2024 Treaty in Six Months 2023. In Six Months 2024, our premiums ceded\nunder quota share treaties decreased by $5,581,000 in comparison to premiums ceded under quota share treaties in Six Months 2023 (see table above). The\ndecrease in Six Months 2024 was attributable to the decrease in quota share ceding percentage rates, offset by an increase in direct written premiums subject to\nthe 2024/2025 Treaty compared to direct written premiums subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Six Months 2024, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $630,000 over the comparable ceded excess of loss premiums for Six Months 2023. The increase was due to an increase in\nsubject premiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (the\n“Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. The Underlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance\ncoverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms were excluded from the Underlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2024,\nthe Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe reinsurance treaties. An increase in our personal\nlines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties\nwill increase. An increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or\nare increasing. On July 1, 2023 and 2022, we recorded our catastrophe premiums written for the entire treaty period covering July 1 through June 30, resulting\nin the entire annual premium written being recorded in the third quarter. The $506,000 negative catastrophe premium in Six Months 2024 was due to a no loss\nbonus from one of our reinsurers. The $1,110,000 negative catastrophe premium in Six Months 2023 was due to a true-up of premiums originally recorded on\nJuly 1, 2022.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $1,361,000, or 2.4%, to $59,124,000 in Six Months 2024 from $57,763,000 in Six Months 2023. The increase was\ndue to the three percentage point reduction in quota share rates discussed above, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the\npremiums ceded and reduced the net premiums earned in Six Months 2023, offset by an increase in catastrophe premium rates, reflected in ceded catastrophe\npremiums earned, which reduced the amount of growth in net premiums earned.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nSix months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 9,117 $ 10,741 $ (1,624) (15.1)%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 12 117 (105) (89.7)%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 9,129 $ 10,858 $ (1,729) (15.9)%\nCeding commission revenue was $9,129,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $10,858,000 in Six Months 2023. The decrease of $1,729,000 is\nexplained below in the discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Six Months 2024, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $9,117,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2024/2025\nTreaty, and in Six Months 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $10,741,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty. The decrease of $1,624,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the decrease in premiums ceded under these treaties during Six\nMonths 2024 compared to Six Months 2023, offset by an increase in ceding commission rates under the 2024/2025 Treaty.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2024/2025 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $3,267,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $2,993,000 in Six Months 2023, an increase of $274,000, or 9.2%. The\naverage yield on non-cash invested assets was 3.81% as of June 30, 2024 compared to 3.63% as of June 30, 2023.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCash and invested assets were $195,789,000 as of June 30, 2024 compared to $175,407,000 as of June 30, 2023, an increase of $20,382,000.\nNet Gains on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $493,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to net gains of $1,422,000 in Six Months 2023. Unrealized gains on our equity\nsecurities and other investments in Six Months 2024 were $919,000, compared to unrealized gains of $1,435,000 in Six Months 2023. Net realized (losses) on\nsales of investments were $(426,000) in Six Months 2024 compared to net realized (losses) of $(13,000) in Six Months 2023.\nOther Income\nOther income was $254,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $312,000 in Six Months 2023, a decrease of $58,000, or 18.6%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $32,098,000 for Six Months 2024 compared to $44,620,000 for Six Months 2023. The net loss ratio was 54.3% in Six Months\n2024 compared to 77.2% in Six Months 2023, a decrease of 22.9 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe net loss ratio for Six Months 2024 improved significantly compared to Six Months 2023. For Six Months 2024, the catastrophe impact, prior year\ndevelopment, and underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) were all lower than for Six Months 2023.\nThere were ten newly designated catastrophe events for Six Months 2024. The estimated total net catastrophe impact for Six Months 2024 was\n$1,872,000, which contributed 3.2 points to the loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Six Months 2023 was 8.9 points. Losses from winter-\nrelated catastrophe claims were minimal during Six Months 2024, whereas the previous year was impacted by a major winter event in February 2023.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 52.8% for Six Months 2024, a decrease of 15.6 points from the 68.4% underlying loss ratio recorded for Six Months 2023.\nOverall personal lines non-catastrophe frequency for Six Months 2024 was lower than for the same period in 2023, which is believed to be the result of the\nCompany’s new Select product as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Overall non-catastrophe severity for Six Months\n2024 was also improved compared to Six Months 2023, primarily driven by water claims and a reduced impact from large losses.\nThere was favorable prior year development of $996,000 during Six Months 2024, which translates to a 1.7-point decrease to the loss ratio. By\ncomparison, the impact of prior year development for Six Months 2023 was a decrease of less than 0.1 points.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $16,084,000 in Six Months 2024 or 15.9% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $17,011,000 in Six\nMonths 2023 or 16.9% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $927,000 was primarily due to a reduction in commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with our Kingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products. The decrease was\noffset by an accrual of $848,000 for an estimated contingent commission to be recalculated quarterly if we continue to be profitable for the remainder of the\nyear.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $11,781,000, or 11.7% of direct earned premiums, in Six Months 2024 compared to $13,555,000, or 13.4% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Six Months 2023. The decrease of $1,774,000, or 13.1%, was primarily due to a $365,000 gain on the commutations of prior years’\nquota share reinsurance treaties from a group of reinsurers, decreases in salaries and employment costs as described below, policy management system fees as\nresult of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems, and other IT costs as a result of the\ncompletion of these projects. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of high inflation.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $5,738,000 in Six Months 2024\ncompared to $5,875,000 in Six Months Ended 2023. The decrease of $137,000, or 2.3%, is favorable when compared to the 8.0% increase in direct written\npremiums. The decrease in salaries and employment costs was due to a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we have been reducing our non-Core\nbusiness. The decrease from the reduction in staff was partially offset in the periods following Six Months 2023, as we began to strengthen our professional\nteam by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0\nand Kingstone 3.0 strategies. In addition, the decrease in salaries and employment costs was offset by $451,000 accrued under our employee bonus plan due to\nthe profitable underwriting insurance operations in Six Months 2024 compared to a loss in Six Months 2023.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Six Months 2024 was 31.3% compared to 33.6% in Six Months 2023.

The executive bonus is due to a $117,000 accrual pursuant to the employment agreement of our Chief Executive\nOfficer. The accrual is a result of the profitable operations before taxes in Six Months 2024 compared to a loss in Six Months 2023.The increase in employment\ncosts was due to fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,216,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $1,587,000 in Six Months 2023. The decrease of $371,000, or 23.4%,\nin depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Six Months 2024 was $1,984,000 compared to $2,016,000 in Six Months 2023, a decrease of $32,000 or 1.6%. In Six Months\n2024 and Six Months 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred interest expense in connection with the 2022\nNotes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in Six Months 2024 was $1,583,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.0%. Income tax (benefit) in Six Months 2023\nwas $(1,290,000), which resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.8%. Income before taxes was $7,525,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to a loss before taxes of\n$6,867,000 in Six Months 2023. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Six Months 2024 compared to Six Months\n2023.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $5,942,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to a net loss of $5,577,000 in Six Months 2023. The increase from net loss to net income of\n$11,519,000 was due to the circumstances described above.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 53,495 $ 47,647 $ 5,848 12.3%\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n53,495 47,647 5,848 12.3%\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 11,211 11,034 177 1.6%\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 1,366 1,062 304 28.6%\nCeded to catastrophe treaties (506) (554) 48 8.7%\nTotal ceded written premiums 12,071 11,541 530 4.6%\nNet written premiums 41,425 36,106 5,319 14.7%\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed (2,485) 3,245 (5,730) na%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (1) (8,636) (9,843) 1,207 12.3%\nChange in net unearned premiums (11,121) (6,598) (4,523) (68.6)%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 51,010 50,892 118 0.2%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (20,707) (21,384) 677 3.2%\nNet premiums earned 30,304 29,508 796 2.7%\nCeding commission revenue (1) 4,562 5,412 (850) (15.7)%\nNet investment income 1,765 1,451 314 21.6%\nNet (losses) gains on investments (234) 197 (431) na%\nOther income 106 151 (45) (29.8)%\nTotal revenues 36,502 36,719 (217) (0.6)%\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 18,627 28,346 (9,719) (34.3)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 570 2,489 (1,919) (77.1)%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 19,197 30,835 (11,638) (37.7)%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 4,775 10,148 (5,373) (52.9)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 183 1,107 (924) (83.5)%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 4,959 11,254 (6,295) (55.9)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 13,852 18,198 (4,346) (23.9)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 386 1,383 (997) (72.1)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 14,238 19,581 (5,343) (27.3)%\nCommission expense 8,232 8,471 (239) (2.8)%\nOther underwriting expenses 5,901 6,684 (783) (11.7)%\nOther operating expenses 801 763 38 5.0%\nDepreciation and amortization 620 779 (159) (20.4)%\nInterest expense 990 1,006 (16) (1.6)%\nTotal expenses 30,782 37,283 (6,501) (17.4)%\nIncome (loss) before taxes 5,720 (564) 6,284 na%\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 1,205 (41) 1,246 na%\nNet income (loss) $ 4,515 $ (523) $ 5,038 na%\n(1) For the three months ended June 30, 2023, our personal lines business was subject to a 30% quota share treaty, expiring on January 1, 2024, which\nincluded a runoff of an 8.5% portion through the remainder of 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, we entered into a 27% personal lines quota share\ntreaty, which includes a runoff of a 3.0% portion through the end of 2024.\n(2) The three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe\nbulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS\ncatastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders\nand insurers.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThree months ended June 30,\nPercentage Percent\n2024 2023 Point Change Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 47.0% 66.4% (19.4) (29.2)%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 31.2% 32.5% (1.3) (4.0)%\nNet combined ratio 78.2% 98.9% (20.7) (20.9)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the three months ended June 30, 2024 (“Three Months 2024”) were $53,495,000 compared to $47,647,000 during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023 (“Three Months 2023”). The increase of $5,848,000, or 12.3%, was primarily due to an increase in premiums from our\npersonal lines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Three Months 2024 were $50,137,000, an increase of $6,126,000, or 13.9%, from\n$44,011,000 in Three Months 2023. The 13.9% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the increase in premiums\nassociated with our Core business of 24.3% offsetting a 59.7% decrease in our non-Core business. The increase in our Core business premiums and the\ndecrease in our non-Core business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Three Months 2024 were $3,338,000, a decrease of $272,000, or 7.5%, from\n$3,610,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an underwriting restriction in place to exclude\ncertain electric vehicles until the approval of adequate rate for the risk was received, which happened in July 2024. The decrease was offset by an increase in\nthe values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $51,306,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $42,212,000 in Three Months 2023, an\nincrease of $9,094,000, or 21.5%. The increase in direct written premiums from our Core business was due to rate increases, offset by a decrease in policies in\nforce. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 4.6% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. Direct written premiums from our\nnon-Core business were $2,190,000 in Three Months 2024 down from $5,435,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $3,245,000, or 59.7%. The decrease in\ndirect written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force\nfrom our non-Core business decreased by 55.0% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in\nour non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n62\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums increased $5,319,000, or 14.7%, to $41,425,000 in Three Months 2024 from $36,106,000 in Three Months 2023. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe increase in Three Months 2024 is primarily due to changes to our personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty. See quota share reinsurance treaties\ndiscussion below.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nOn January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1,\n2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”). Our personal lines\nbusiness was subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty in Three Months 2024, and the 2023/2024 Treaty in Three Months 2023. In Three Months 2024, our premiums\nceded under quota share treaties increased by $177,000 in comparison to premiums ceded under quota share treaties in Three Months 2023 (see table above).\nThe increase in Three Months 2024 was attributable to the increase in direct written premiums subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty compared to direct written\npremiums subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty. The increase in ceded premiums related to the increase in direct written premiums was offset by the decrease in\nquota share ceding percentage rates.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Three Months 2024, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $304,000 over the comparable ceded excess of loss premiums for Three Months 2023. The increase was due to an increase\nin subject premiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty\n(the “Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. The Underlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance\ncoverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms were excluded from the Underlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2024,\nthe Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe reinsurance treaties. An increase in our personal\nlines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties\nwill increase. An increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or\nare increasing. On July 1, 2023 and 2022, we recorded our catastrophe premiums written for the entire treaty period covering July 1 through June 30, resulting\nin the entire annual premium written being recorded in the third quarter. The $506,000 negative catastrophe premium in Three Months 2024 was due to a no\nloss bonus from one of our reinsurers. The $554,000 negative catastrophe premium in Three Months 2023 was due to a true-up of premiums originally\nrecorded on July 1, 2022.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $796,000, or 2.7%, to $30,304,000 in Three Months 2024 from $29,508,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase was\ndue to the three percentage point reduction in quota share rates discussed above, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the\npremiums ceded and reduced the net premiums earned in Three Months 2023, offset by an increase in catastrophe premium rates, reflected in ceded catastrophe\npremiums earned, which reduced the amount of growth in net premiums earned.\n63\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,562 $ 5,294 $ (732) (13.8)%\nContingent ceding commissions earned - 118 (118) (100.0)%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 4,562 $ 5,412 $ (850) (15.7)%\nCeding commission revenue was $4,562,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $5,412,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $850,000 is\nexplained below in the discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Three Months 2024, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,562,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2024/2025\nTreaty, and in Three Months 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of 5,294,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty. The decrease of $732,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the decrease in premiums ceded under these treaties during Three\nMonths 2024 compared to Three Months 2023, offset by an increase in ceding commission rates under the 2024/2025 Treaty.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2024/2025 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties.

Unrealized gains on\nour equity securities and other investments in Three Months 2024 were $100,000, compared to unrealized gains of $208,000 in Three Months 2023. Net\nrealized (losses) on sales of investments were $(333,000) in Three Months 2024 compared to net realized (losses) of $(10,000) in Three Months 2023.\nOther Income\nOther income was $106,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $151,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $45,000, or 29.8%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $14,238,000 for Three Months 2024 compared to $19,581,000 for Three Months 2023.

For Three Months 2024, the catastrophe impact,\nprior year development, and underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) were all lower than Three Months\n2023.\nThere were four newly designated catastrophe events for Three Months 2024, and the total loss ratio impact was immaterial. The estimated total net\ncatastrophe impact for the calendar quarter was $386,000, which contributed 1.3 points to the loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Three\nMonths 2023 was 4.7 points.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 47.1% for Three Months 2024, a decrease of 14.6 points from the 61.7% underlying loss ratio recorded for Three\nMonths 2023. Overall personal lines non-catastrophe frequency for Three Months 2024 was lower than for the same period in 2023, which is believed to be the\nresult of the Company’s new Select product as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Overall non-catastrophe severity for\nThree Months 2024 was also improved compared to Three Months 2023, primarily driven by water claims and a reduced impact from large losses.\nThere was favorable prior year development of $430,000 during Three Months 2024, which translates to a 1.4-point decrease to the loss ratio. By\ncomparison, the impact of prior year development for Three Months 2023 was a decrease of 0.1 points.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $8,232,000 in Three Months 2024 or 16.1% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $8,471,000 in Three\nMonths 2023 or 16.6% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $239,000 was primarily due to a reduction in commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with our Kingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products. The decrease was\noffset by an accrual of $545,000 for an estimated contingent commission to be recalculated quarterly if we continue to be profitable for the remainder of the\nyear.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $5,901,000, or 11.6% of direct earned premiums, in Three Months 2024 compared to $6,684,000, or 13.1% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $783,000, or 11.7%, was primarily due to a $365,000 gain on the commutations of prior years’\nquota share reinsurance treaties from a group of reinsurers, decreases in salaries and employment costs excluding employee bonuses as described below, policy\nmanagement system fees as result of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems, and other\nIT costs as a result of the completion of these projects. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of high inflation.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs excluding employee bonuses of $2,748,000\nin Three Months 2024 compared to $2,942,000 in Three Months Ended 2023. The decrease of $194,000, or 6.6%, is favorable when compared to the 12.0%\nincrease in direct written premiums. The decrease in salaries and employment costs was due to a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we have\nbeen reducing our non-Core business. The decrease from the reduction in staff was partially offset in the periods following Three Months 2023, as we began to\nstrengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and staff needed to manage the business\nconsistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies. In addition, the decrease in salaries and employment costs excluding employee bonuses was\noffset by $388,000 accrued under our employee bonus plan due to the profitable underwriting insurance operations in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss in\nThree Months 2023.\n66\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Three Months 2024 was 31.2% compared to 32.5% in Three Months 2023.

The executive bonus is due to a $117,000 accrual pursuant to the employment\nagreement of our Chief Executive Officer. The accrual is a result of the profitable operations before taxes in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss in Three\nMonths 2023.The decrease in employment costs was due to fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested\nportfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $620,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $779,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $159,000, or\n20.4%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Three Months 2024 was $990,000 compared to $1,006,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $16,000 or 1.6%. In Three Months\n2024 and Three Months 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred interest expense in connection with the\n2022 Notes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in Three Months 2024 was $1,205,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.1%. Income tax (benefit) in Three Months\n2023 was $(41,000), which resulted in an effective tax rate of 7.3%. Income before taxes was $5,720,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss before\ntaxes of $564,000 in Three Months 2023. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Three Months 2024 compared to\nThree Months 2023.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $4,515,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to a net loss of $523,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase from net loss to net\nincome of $5,038,000 was due to the circumstances described above.\n68\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources\n(“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or\nunavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for\nsimilar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level 2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market\nparticipants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level 3”). As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 69% and 65%, respectively, of the investment\nportfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\n77\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the\nsecurity has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nJune 30, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ - $ - - $ 5,979,360 (17,340) 1 $ 5,979,360 $ (17,340)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,169,433 (3,337,986) 12 13,169,433 (3,337,986)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 66,247,579 (5,850,585) 80 66,247,579 (5,850,585)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 114,017 (1,377) 6 37,025,197 (6,881,211) 39 37,139,214 (6,882,588)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $ 114,017 $ (1,377) 6 $122,421,569 $(16,087,122) 132 $122,535,586 $(16,088,499)\n78\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $5,974,440 $ (17,373) 1 $ - - - $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,398,552 (3,209,161) 13 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 70,107,746 (5,885,296) 85 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 88,988 (2,144) 4 38,675,604 (6,541,731) 37 38,764,592 (6,543,875)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $6,063,428 $ (19,517) 5 $122,181,902 $(15,636,188) 135 $128,245,330 $(15,655,705)\n79\nTable of Contents\nThere were 138 securities at June 30, 2024 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of\nwhich were deemed to be credit losses by us. There were 140 securities at December 31, 2023 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity\nsecurities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed to be credit losses by us. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were\ntemporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and\ninterest rate environment factors, management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these\ninvestments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends and distributions received from KICO, which are subject to statutory\nrestrictions. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, KICO did not pay any dividends to us. As of June 30, 2024, KICO had a negative adjusted unassigned\nsurplus. Based on that, KICO currently will not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. In December 2023, KICO received\nregulatory approval to pay us a $2,300,000 distribution from paid in capital. KICO paid us the $2,300,000 distribution in the second quarter of 2024.\nKICO is a member of the FHLBNY, which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low-cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of\nKICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is March 31, 2024. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew KICO’s ratings as KICO\nrequested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO is currently only able to\nborrow on an overnight basis. The maximum allowable advance as of June 30, 2024, based on the net admitted assets as of March 31, 2024, was approximately\n$12,692,000. Available collateral as of June 30, 2024 was approximately $10,626,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral. There\nwere no borrowings under this facility during Six Months 2024.\nOn April 5, 2024, we filed a shelf registration (the “Shelf Registration”) statement on Form S-3 with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended, with regard to the registration of $50,000,000 of our equity and debt securities (the “Shelf Registration Statement”). The Shelf Registration\nStatement was declared effective by the SEC on April 22, 2024. Pursuant to the requirements of Form S-3, we currently may sell pursuant to the Shelf\nRegistration Statement, during any 12 month period, equity securities having an aggregate market value of no more than one-third of the aggregate market\nvalue of the shares of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates. Any offering made pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement may only be made by means\nof a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective Shelf Registration Statement, relating to the offering.\n80\nTable of Contents\nIn May 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC (the “Sales Agent”) under which we currently have the ability\nto issue and sell shares of our Common Stock, from time to time, through the Sales Agent, pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, up to an aggregate\noffering price of approximately $16,400,000 in what is commonly referred to as an “at-the-market” (“ATM”) program. During the three months ended June 30,\n2024, we sold 56,109 shares of our Common Stock at a weighted average price of $4.84 per share and raised $167,629 in net proceeds under the ATM program.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had remaining capacity to sell up to an additional $16,128,423 of our Common Stock under the ATM program.\nOn December 15, 2022, we issued 2022 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $19,950,000 pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. We are\nrequired to make semi-annual interest payments in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is December 30,\n2024.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company debt service and other cash requirements,\nwe will seek to obtain additional financing. See Notes 2 and 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a\ndiscussion of our plans in this regard.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nSix Months ended June 30, 2024 2023\nCash flows provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 13,214,888 $ (17,009,995)\nInvesting activities (9,612,199) 17,890,127\nFinancing activities (408,694) (551,936)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents 3,193,995 328,196\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 8,976,998 11,958,228\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 12,170,993 $ 12,286,424\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $13,215,000 in Six Months 2024 as compared to $17,010,000 used in operating activities in Six Months\n2023. The $30,225,000 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in Six Months 2024 as compared to Six Months 2023 was primarily the result of\nan increase in net income from net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of $14,768,000 and in cash provided arising from net fluctuations in operating assets and\nliabilities. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations, payments\non claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash used by investing activities was $9,612,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $17,890,000 provided by investing activities in Six Months\n2023 resulting in a $27,502,000 increase in net cash used by investing activities. In Six Months 2024, we had net cash used by our investment portfolio of\n$8,574,000, compared to $18,789,000 provided in Six Months 2023.\n81\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used in financing activities was $409,000 in Six Months 2024 compared to $552,000 used in Six Months 2023. Net cash used in financing\nactivities are primarily principal payments on equipment financing debt in connection with KICO’s sale-leaseback transaction.\nReinsurance\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consisted of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27%\nquota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”).\nOur excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties expired on June 30, 2024 and we entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance\ntreaties effective July 1, 2024 (as discussed below). Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying\nXOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying XOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance coverage for losses\nof $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the Underlying XOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL\nTreaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. Effective January 1, 2024, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed\ncovering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025. Effective July 1, 2024, we purchased $275,000,000 of catastrophe reinsurance in excess of\n$5,000,000, compared to $315,000,000 of catastrophe reinsurance in excess of $10,000,000 in the expiring treaty. Our ability to be able to reduce our\ncatastrophe reinsurance was due to our tightened underwriting as discussed above and curtailing new business growth through June 30, 2024, which reduced\nour probable maximum loss. Effective July 1, 2024, we renewed our excess of loss treaty with the same terms as the expiring treaty. Material terms for our\nreinsurance treaties in effect for the treaty years shown below are as follows:\n82\nTable of Contents\nTreaty Period\n2024/2025 Treaty 2023/2024 Treaty 2021/2023 Treaty\nJanuary 2, July 1, January 1, July 1, January 1, July 1, December 31,\n2025 2024 2024 2023 2023 2022 2021\nto to to to to to to\nJune 30, January 1, June 30, January 1, June 30, January 1, June 30,\nLine of Business 2025 2025 2024 2024 2023 2023 2022\nPersonal Lines:\nHomeowners, dwelling\nfire and canine legal\nliability Quota share\ntreaty:\nPercent ceded (7) (6) 27% 27% 30% 30% 30% 30%\nRisk retained on\ninitial $1,000,000 of\nlosses (5) (6) (7) $ 1,000,000 $ 730,000 $ 730,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000 $ 700,000\nLosses per\noccurrence subject to\nquota share\nreinsurance coverage (6) $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000 $ 1,000,000\nExpiration date (6) January 1, 2025 January 1, 2025 January 1, 2024 January 1, 2024 January 1, 2023 January 1, 2023\nExcess of loss\ncoverage and\nfacultative facility\ncoverage (1) (5) (6) $ 8,000,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000 $ 8,400,000\nin excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of in excess of\n$ 1,000,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000 $ 600,000\nTotal reinsurance\ncoverage per\noccurrence (5) (6) $ 8,000,000 $ 8,470,000 $ 8,470,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000 $ 8,500,000\nLosses per\noccurrence subject to\nreinsurance coverage\n(6) $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000 $ 9,000,000\nExpiration date (6) June 30, 2025 June 30, 2025 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nCatastrophe\nReinsurance:\nInitial loss subject to\npersonal lines quota\nshare treaty (6) (6) $ 5,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000 $ 10,000,000\nRisk retained per\ncatastrophe\noccurrence (6) (7) (8) 5,000,000 4,750,000 $ 9,500,000 $ 8,750,000 $ 8,750,000 $ 7,400,000 $ 7,400,000\nCatastrophe loss\ncoverage in excess of\nquota share coverage\n(2) (6) $275,000,000 $ 275,000,000 $ 315,000,000 $ 315,000,000 $ 335,000,000 $ 335,000,000 $ 490,000,000\nReinstatement\npremium protection Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\n(3) (4)\n(1) For personal lines, includes the addition of an automatic facultative facility allowing KICO to obtain homeowners single risk coverage up to $9,000,000\nin total insured value, which covers direct losses from $3,500,000 to $9,000,000 through June 30, 2025.\n(2) Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts.

Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to\nbe higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nWhile the rate of inflation has moderated in 2024, Three Months 2024 and Six Months 2024 still include the continuing effects of prior years’\neconomic inflation, which resulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower public equity valuations, and significant\nfinancial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads reduced the value of our fixed income securities in Three Months 2024 and\nSix Months 2024, which lowered our stockholders’ equity. For Three Months 2024 and Six Months 2024, the continuing effects of prior economic inflation\nimpacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively impact our results of\noperations.\n84\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return.\nOn August 2, 2024, two large competitors announced a plan to wind down their personal lines operations in New York State and to non-renew or mid-\nterm cancel their entire book of business before year end 2024. The policyholders of such competitors will need to find alternative coverage. It is anticipated\nthat our producers will want KICO to provide coverage to many of these policyholders. As such, we anticipate a sizeable increase in our policies in force and\ndirect written premium for the remainder of the year. See “Forward-Looking Statements” before Part I, Item 1.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThis item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to assure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were: (i) effective in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on\nthis evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30,\n2024.\n85\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n86\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Kingstone assumes no obligation to update this guidance. The actual results may be\nmaterially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in this press release and in Kingstone's annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES 22\nDirect premiums written represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period.\nNet premiums written are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the\nfiscal period presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct\npremiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to\nadjusted EBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on\ninvestments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures\nmost closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and basic operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company’s\noverall profitability.\nOperating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share are the GAAP\nmeasures most closely comparable to operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may\nvary significantly between periods. Operating net income (loss) and diluted operating net income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the\nCompany’s overall profitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating\nreturn on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company’s overall return on average common equity.\nUnderlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio less the effect of prior year loss reserve development and catastrophes losses.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s\nloss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately\nwhen reviewing the Company’s underwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The underlying loss ratio should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company’s net loss ratio.\nNet loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s net loss ratios to vary significantly between\nperiods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company’s\nunderwriting performance. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does not reflect the Company’s net loss ratio.\nRECONCILIATION OF DIRECT PREMIUMS WRITTEN TO NET\n23\nPREMIUMS EARNED\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(000’s except percentages)\nDirect Written Premiums Reconciliation:\nDirect premiums written $53,495 $47,647 12.3 % $102,820 $95,244 8.0 %\nCeded written premiums1 (12,071) (11,541) 4.6 (23,300) ($27,647) (15.7)\nNet premiums written 41,425 36,106 14.7 79,520 67,598 17.6\nChange in unearned premiums (11,121) (6,598) 68.6 (20,397) (9,835) 107.4\nNet premiums earned $30,304 $29,508 2.7 % $59,124 $57,763 2.4 %\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\n1Net premiums written balances from prior year periods were reclassified to conform with current year presentation.\nThe reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA\n24\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(000’s except percentages)\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) $4,515 ($522) NM % $5,942 ($5,577) NM %\nInterest expense 990 1,006 (1.6) 1,984 2,016 (1.6)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 1,205 (41) NM 1,583 (1,290) NM\nDepreciation and amortization 620 779 (20.4) 1,216 1,587 (23.4)\nEBITDA 7,330 1,221 500.3 10,725 (3,265) NM\nNet loss (gain) on investments 234 (197) NM (493) (1,422) (65.3)\nStock-based compensation 281 212 32.5 547 429 27.5\nAdjusted EBITDA $7,845 $1,236 534.7 % $10,779 (4,258) NM %\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nNET INCOME (LOSS) TO OPERATING NET INCOME (LOSS)\n25\nAND BASIC INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE TO BASIC\nOPERATING NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nBasic Basic\nBasic loss Basic loss\nincome income\nper per\nAmount per Amount Amount per Amount\ncommon common\ncommon common\nshare share\nshare share\n(000’s except per common s are amounts and percentages)\nOperating Net Income (Loss) and Operating Net Income (Loss) per Basic Common Share Reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) $4,515 $0.41 ($522) ($0.05) $5,942 $0.54 ($5,577) ($0.52)\nNet loss (gain) on investments 234 (197) (493) (1,422)\nLess tax benefit (expense) on\n49 (41) (104) (299)\nnet loss (gain)\nNet loss (gain) on investments,\n185 $0.02 (156) ($0.01) (389) ($0.04) (1,123) ($0.10)\nnet of taxes\nOperating net income (loss) $4,699 $0.43 ($678) ($0.06) $5,552 $0.50 ($6,700) ($0.62)\nWeighted average basic shares\n11,019,347 10,755,848 11,009,442 10,753,974\noutstanding\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nNET INCOME (LOSS) TO OPERATING NET INCOME (LOSS) AND\n26\nDILUTED INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE TO DILUTED OPERATING\nNET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023 June 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nDiluted Diluted\nDiluted Diluted\nincome income\nloss per loss per\nAmount per Amount Amount per Amount\ncommon common\ncommon common\nshare share\nshare share\n(000’s except per common s are amounts and percentages)\nOperating Net Income (Loss) and Operating Net Income (Loss) per Diluted Common Share Reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) $4,515 $0.37 ($522) ($0.05) $5,942 $0.50 ($5,577) $ (0.52)\nNet loss (gain) on investments 234 (197) (493) (1,422)\nLess tax benefit (expense) on\n49 (41) (104) (299)\nnet loss (gain)\nNet loss (gain) on investments,\n185 $0.02 (156) ($0.01) (389) ($0.03) (1,123) $ (0.10)\nnet of taxes\nOperating net income (loss) $4,699 $0.39 ($678) ($0.06) $5,552 $0.46 (6,700) $ (0.62)\nWeighted average diluted shares\n12,110,946 10,755,848 11,987,976 10,753,974\noutstanding\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO OPERATING NET\n27\nINCOME (LOSS) AND RETURN ON EQUITY TO OPERATING\nRETURN ON EQUITY\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(000’s except percentages)\nOperating Net Income (Loss) Reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) $4,515 ($522) NM $5,942 ($5,577) NM\nNet loss (gain) on investments 234 (197) NM (493) (1,422) 65.3%\nLess tax benefit (expense) on net loss (gain) 49 (41) NM (104) (299) 65.2%\nNet loss (gain) on investments, net of taxes 185 (156) NM (389) (1,123) 65.4%\nOperating Net Income (loss) $4,699 ($678) NM $5,552 ($6,700) NM\nOperating Return on Equity Reconciliation:\nNet income (loss) $4,515 ($522) NM $5,942 ($5,577) NM\nAverage equity $38,276 $32,684 17.1% $37,653 $34,127 10.3%\nReturn on equity 11.8% (1.6%) NM 15.8% (16.3%) NM\nReturn on equity -

(Nasdaq: KINS) (the “Company” or “Kingstone”), a\nNortheast regional property and casualty insurance holding company, today announced its financial results for\nthe first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company will hold its first quarter 2024 financial results conference\ncall on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. With this release, the Company has provided an\ninvestor presentation that can be accessed through the Investor Relations/Events & Presentations section of the\nCompany website (www.kingstonecompanies.com).\nFirst Quarter 2024 Key Financial and Operational Highlights\n($ in thousands, except per share data) 2024 2023 Change\nDirect premiums written1 – Core Business $46,587 $41,427 12.5%\nCombined ratio 93.3% 123.3% -30.0 pts\nNet Income/(Loss) $1,427 ($5,055) NM\nNet Income/(Loss) per share – basic $0.13 ($0.47) NM\nReturn on equity – annualized 16.2% (58.2%) NM\nManagement Commentary\nMeryl Golden, Chief Executive Officer of Kingstone Companies, Inc., stated, “We're delighted to share our\nachievements for the first quarter of 2024, marked by significant growth in Core Business premium and strong\nprofitability, building upon the success we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2023. Favorable weather conditions\nfurther complemented our underwriting performance. These results serve as validation of the effectiveness of\nour strategic initiatives.\n“Core Business direct premiums written rose nearly 13% during the quarter driven by ongoing price increases as\nwell as an expansion of our underwriting appetite. We are confident we can profitably accelerate our Core\nBusiness growth as we continue to strategically run-off our Non-Core Business premium, which we successfully\ncontracted by 56% from the prior year period.\n“Our underlying loss ratio improved by 16.6 points, largely driven by both lower frequency and severity. The\nmild weather conditions experienced throughout the quarter positively impacted our catastrophe loss ratio by\n8 points, and we experienced 2-points of favorable development, primarily attributable to the reevaluation of\nprior period catastrophe losses. Our expense ratio was down 3.4 points, and the combined ratio of 93.3% marked\na 30-point decrease from the prior year period.”\nMs. Golden concluded, “With robust performance during the first three months and increased momentum in\nour business, we are raising our guidance to provide enhanced transparency into our efforts to build long-term\nshareholder value.”\nGuidance\nFor 2024, the Company’s full year expectations are calculated based on net premiums earned of approximately\n$125 million, and are as follows:\nGuidance 2024 Previous\nCore Business direct premiums written growth 16.0% to 20.0% 12.0% to 16.0%\nCombined ratio 86.0% to 90.0% 88.0% to 92.0%\nNet income per share – basic* $0.75 to $1.10 $0.50 to $0.90\nReturn on equity 22.0% to 30.0% 15.0% to 22.0%\n*The variance between net income per share – diluted and basic is immaterial.

Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most\ncomparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal\nperiod presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net\npremiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct premiums written and\nnet premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the\nCompany’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains\n(losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted\nEBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be\nskewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments,\nand stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information,\nnot as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of\nnet gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely\ncomparable to operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s\nperformance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary significantly\nbetween periods. Operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as\na substitute for net income (loss) and basic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive\nof net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share are the GAAP measures most\nclosely comparable to operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the\nCompany’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments and may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental\ninformation, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the Company’s overall\nprofitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely\ncomparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results,\nwhich can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating return\non equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company’s overall\nreturn on average common equity.\nUnderlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio less the effect of prior year\nloss reserve development and catastrophes losses.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business\nthat may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s loss ratios\nto vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the\nnet loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the\nCompany’s underwriting performance.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nKingstone Companies, Inc. (referred to herein as “Kingstone” or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), underwrites property and casualty insurance exclusively. KICO is\na New York domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, 94.4% and\n87.0%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. Kingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc.\n(“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these\nagencies.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The principles for condensed interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 1, 2024. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited by\nan independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) but, in the\nopinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of\nthe Company’s financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 may not be indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nComponents of ceded premiums written within prior year net earned premiums in Note 6 were reclassified to conform with an elected change in the prior year\npresentation during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, by recording ceded written premiums for the 12 months of the contract term at inception, rather than\nmonthly over the contract term, providing a full disclosure of the premiums ceded. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported\nfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 2 – Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation; Going Concern\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further\ninformation.\nThe Company’s $19,950,000 Notes Payable (the “2022 Notes”) are due on December 30, 2024. The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent\non its ability to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy such obligation. Management believes that KICO’s insurance operations would be able to\ncontinue in the unlikely event that financing is not obtained.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company\nhas the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they\nbecome due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation requires management to perform two steps. First,\nmanagement must evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nSecond, if management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is required to consider whether it has plans in place to alleviate that doubt.\nDisclosures in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements are required if management concludes that substantial doubt exists or that its plans\nalleviate the substantial doubt that was raised.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP assuming that the Company will continue as a\ngoing concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or\nthe amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nManagement’s Plan Related to Going Concern\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy its debt obligation on December 30, 2024.\nManagement plans to refinance the 2022 Notes with a new issue of equity securities and/or investment grade debt securities of similar or longer maturity that\nwould result in net proceeds equal to or greater than the principal amount of the 2022 Notes. In connection therewith, the Company will be utilizing\ninvestment bankers to serve as underwriters or placement agents for proposed offerings by the Company of its securities (including debt, common and/or\npreferred securities). The offerings would be of such size as to generate proceeds to the Company of no less than $19,950,000. The Company, subject to\nregulatory approval, may receive distributions paid to it by KICO, its insurance subsidiary, that could be utilized to repay the 2022 Notes. Further, the\nCompany may also use available invested assets and cash to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. As of March 31, 2024, invested assets and cash was\napproximately $1,789,000.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described above. The Company\nbelieves that its plan is probable of being implemented and that such plan would alleviate any adverse conditions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and includes the reserves for losses and\nloss adjustment expense (“LAE”), which are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be\nreported and settled over a period of many years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with loss and LAE recoverable under reinsurance contracts\nand other receivables or payable under reinsurance contracts related to contingent ceding commission revenue require judgments by management. On an\nongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating these estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from the\nestimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n7\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, CMIC Properties, Inc. (“Properties”) and 15 Joys Lane, LLC (“15 Joys Lane”), which together own the land and building from which KICO\noperates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-\n09”), which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The\nstandard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. ASU-\n2023-09 is effective for public companies with annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on its disclosures.\nThe Company has determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position,\nresults of operations and cash flows, or do not apply to its operations.\nNote 3 - Investments\nFixed-Maturity Securities\nThe amortized cost, estimated fair value, and gross unrealized gains and losses on investments in fixed-maturity securities classified as available-for-sale for\nwhich an allowance for credit loss has not been recorded, as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are summarized as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024\nCost or Gross Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Net\nAmortized Unrealized Less than 12 More than 12 Fair Unrealized\nCategory Cost Gains Months Months Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S.\ngovernment corporations and agencies (1) $ 35,735,950 $ - $ (28,592) $ - $ 35,707,358 $ (28,592)\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions 16,600,086 - - (3,289,577) 13,310,509 (3,289,577)\nCorporate and other bonds\nIndustrial and miscellaneous 74,663,044 - - (6,019,568) 68,643,476 (6,019,568)\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities (2) 50,345,615 133,220 (3,266) (6,889,842) 43,585,727 (6,759,888)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $177,344,695 $ 133,220 $ (31,858) $ (16,198,987) $161,247,070 $(16,097,625)\n8\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nCost or Gross Gross Unrealized Losses Estimated Net\nAmortized Unrealized Less than 12 More than 12 Fair Unrealized\nCategory Cost Gains Months Months Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S.\ngovernment corporations and agencies (1) $ 20,954,764 $ 1,799 $ (17,373) $ - $ 20,939,190 $ (15,574)\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and\nPossessions 16,607,713 - - (3,209,161) 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds\nIndustrial and miscellaneous 75,993,042 - - (5,885,296) 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities\n(2) 50,905,423 113,761 (2,144) (6,541,731) 44,475,309 (6,430,114)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $164,460,942 $ 115,560 $ (19,517) $ (15,636,188) $148,920,797 $(15,540,145)\n(1) In October 2022, KICO placed certain U.S. Treasury securities to fulfill the required collateral for a sale-leaseback transaction in a designated custodian\naccount (see Note 9 – Debt - “Equipment Financing”). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of required collateral was\napproximately $6,576,000 and $6,999,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the U.S. Treasury\nsecurities used as eligible collateral was approximately $ 5,969,000 and $11,960,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, cash was used to cover the\nremaining eligible collateral.\n(2) KICO has placed certain residential mortgage backed securities as eligible collateral in a designated custodian account related to its membership in the\nFederal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) (see Note 9 – Debt – “Federal Home Loan Bank”). The eligible collateral would be pledged to\nFHLBNY if KICO draws an advance from the FHLBNY credit line.

The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to\nbe collected and the amortized cost basis, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company considers all available\nevidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded, which is recognized in net loss through an\nallowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nThe Company did not identify any available-for-sale securities as of March 31, 2024 which presented a risk of loss due to credit deterioration of the security.\nAt both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 140 fixed-maturity securities that accounted for the gross unrealized losses. The Company\ndetermined that none of the unrealized losses were deemed to be credit losses for its portfolio of investments for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023. Significant factors influencing the Company’s determination that unrealized losses were temporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude\nof the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and interest rate environment factors, and management’s intent and\nability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery of estimated fair value to the Company’s cost basis.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at March 31, 2024 as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $35,707,358 $ (28,592) 2 $ - - - $ 35,707,358 $ (28,592)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,310,509 (3,289,577) 13 13,310,509 (3,289,577)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 67,648,476 (6,019,568) 82 67,648,476 (6,019,568)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 111,165 (3,266) 6 37,784,418 (6,889,842) 37 37,895,583 (6,893,108)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $35,818,523 $ (31,858) 8 $118,743,403 $(16,198,987) 132 $154,561,926 $(16,230,845)\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at December 31, 2023 as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $5,974,440 $ (17,373) 1 $ - - - $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 13,398,552 (3,209,161) 13 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 70,107,746 (5,885,296) 85 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 88,988 (2,144) 4 38,675,604 (6,541,731) 37 38,764,592 (6,543,875)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $6,063,428 $ (19,517) 5 $122,181,902 $(15,636,188) 135 $128,245,330 $(15,655,705)\n15\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s investments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 indicating the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\nMarch 31, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 35,707,358 $ - $ - $ 35,707,358\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,310,509 - 13,310,509\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 68,643,476 - - 68,643,476\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 43,585,727 - 43,585,727\nTotal fixed maturities 104,350,834 56,896,236 - 161,247,070\nEquity securities 13,536,833 - - 13,536,833\nTotal investments, at fair value $ 117,887,667 $ 56,896,236 $ - $ 174,783,903\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 20,939,190 $ - $ - $ 20,939,190\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,398,552 - 13,398,552\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 70,107,746 - - 70,107,746\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 44,475,309 - 44,475,309\nTotal fixed maturities 91,046,936 57,873,861 - 148,920,797\nEquity securities 14,762,340 - - 14,762,340\nTotal investments, at fair value $ 105,809,276 $ 57,873,861 $ - $ 163,683,137\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s investment in a hedge fund measured at Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023.

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $566,268 favorable and $3,121 favorable, respectively. Management, on a quarterly basis,\nperforms a review of open liability claims to assess carried case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve levels, giving consideration to both Company\nand industry trends.\n18\nTable of Contents\nLoss and LAE Reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where\nan unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods– historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate estimate\nof IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\nIn New York State, lawsuits for negligence are subject to certain limitations and must be commenced within three years from the date of the accident or are\notherwise barred. Accordingly, the Company’s exposure to unreported claims (“pure” IBNR) for accident dates of March 31, 2021 and prior is limited,\nalthough there remains the possibility of adverse development on reported claims (“case development” IBNR). In certain rare circumstances states have\nretroactively revised a statute of limitations. The Company is not aware of any such effort that would have a material impact on the Company’s results.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of March 31, 2024, net of reinsurance, as well as the cumulative reported claims\nby accident year and total IBNR reserves as of March 31, 2024 included in the net incurred loss and allocated expense amounts. The historical information\nregarding incurred and paid claims development for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2023 is presented as supplementary unaudited\ninformation.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAll Lines of Business\n(in thousands except reported claims data)\nAs of\nIncurred Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance March 31, 2024\nThree Cumulative\nMonths Number of\nEnded Reported\nFor the Years Ended December 31, March 31, Claims by\nAccident Accident\nYear 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 IBNR Year\n(Unaudited 2015 - 2023) (Unaudited)\n2015 $22,340 $21,994 $22,148 $22,491 $23,386 $23,291 $23,528 $23,533 $23,428 $ 23,499 $ 281 2,559\n2016 26,062 24,941 24,789 27,887 27,966 27,417 27,352 27,271 27,247 108 2,881\n2017 31,605 32,169 35,304 36,160 36,532 36,502 36,819 36,830 227 3,401\n2018 54,455 56,351 58,441 59,404 61,237 61,145 61,252 585 4,236\n2019 75,092 72,368 71,544 71,964 73,310 73,438 1,316 4,505\n2020 63,083 62,833 63,217 63,562 63,583 1,418 5,889\n2021 96,425 96,673 96,134 96,468 3,308 5,819\n2022 79,835 78,759 79,274 5,540 4,692\n2023 78,978 76,887 14,800 4,024\n2024 16,827 7,683 832\nTotal $ 555,304\nAll Lines of Business\n(in thousands)\nCumulative Paid Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nThree\nMonths\nEnded\nFor the Years Ended December 31, March 31,\nAccident\nYear 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n(Unaudited 2015 - 2023) (Unaudited)\n2015 $ 12,295 $ 16,181 $ 18,266 $ 19,984 $ 21,067 $ 22,104 $ 22,318 $ 22,473 $ 22,519 $ 22,530\n2016 15,364 19,001 21,106 23,974 25,234 25,750 26,382 26,854 26,860\n2017 16,704 24,820 28,693 31,393 32,529 33,522 34,683 34,729\n2018 32,383 44,516 50,553 52,025 54,424 56,199 56,313\n2019 40,933 54,897 58,055 60,374 63,932 64,845\n2020 39,045 50,719 53,432 56,523 57,938\n2021 56,282 77,756 82,317 83,311\n2022 45,856 65,732 66,367\n2023 46,280 53,203\n2024 3,979\nTotal $ 470,076\nNet liability for unpaid loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses for the accident years presented $ 85,228\nAll outstanding liabilities before 2015, net of reinsurance 526\nLiabilities for loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance $ 85,753\n(Components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n21\nTable of Contents\nReported claim counts are measured on an occurrence or per event basis.

The reinsurance program also provides income as a result\nof ceding commissions earned pursuant to the quota share reinsurance contracts. The Company’s participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve the\nCompany of its obligations to policyholders.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe Company earned ceding commission revenue under the 2024/2025 Treaty for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and under the 2023/2024 Treaty for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023, based on a fixed provisional commission rate at which provisional ceding commissions are earned. The Company\nearned ceding commission revenue under its quota share reinsurance agreements that expired prior to the 2021/2023 Treaty based on: (i) a fixed provisional\ncommission rate at which provisional ceding commissions were earned, and (ii) under certain of the quota share reinsurance agreements, a continuing sliding\nscale of commission rates and ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each of these agreements based upon which contingent ceding\ncommissions are earned. The sliding scale includes minimum and maximum commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. The commission rate\nand contingent ceding commissions earned increase when the estimated ultimate loss ratio decreases and, conversely, the commission rate and contingent\nceding commissions earned decrease when the estimated ultimate loss ratio increases.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCeding commission revenue consists of the following:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,555,240 $ 5,446,808\nContingent ceding commissions earned 11,871 (1,401)\n$ 4,567,111 $ 5,445,407\nProvisional ceding commissions are settled monthly. Balances due from reinsurers for contingent ceding commissions on quota share treaties are settled\nperiodically based on the Loss Ratio of each treaty year that ends on June 30, for the expired treaties that were subject to contingent commissions. As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net contingent ceding commissions payable to\nreinsurers under all treaties was approximately $3,290,000 and $3,302,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 7 – Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nIn July 2017, KICO became a member of, and invested in, the FHLBNY. KICO is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of FHLBNY. Based\non redemption provisions of FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, FHLBNY may declare dividends on the\nstock. Management reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no\nimpairment has been recognized. FHLBNY members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling\nmembers to customize advances, which are to be fully collateralized. Eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account\navailable for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the previous quarter. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew\nKICO’s ratings as KICO requested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO\nis currently only able to borrow on an overnight basis. If KICO has collateral, based on KICO’s net admitted assets, the maximum allowable advance as of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately $12,512,000 and $12,813,000, respectively. Available collateral as of March 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 was approximately $10,929,000 and $11,412,000, respectively. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral.

The amount of other operating expenses paid in cash in the preceding\nclause (ii) shall not exceed $2.5 million. Holding Company Expenses was determined based on the actual Holding Company Expenses for the nine months\nending September 30, 2023, and an estimate of Holding Company Expenses for the three months ending December 30, 2023. The Ordinary Dividend Paying\nCapacity of KICO as defined above was zero and, accordingly, the Company was not required to make a mandatory redemption of the 2022 Notes on\nDecember 30, 2023.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe 2022 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not the obligations of or guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries.

The Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness, but are effectively\nsubordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. In addition, the 2022 Notes are\nstructurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe 2022 Notes will be redeemable, at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time or in part from time to time, on and after December 30, 2022,\nupon not less than fifteen (15) nor more than sixty (60) days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (“Redemption Prices” ) (expressed as percentages of\nthe principal amount thereof) if redeemed during the respective period set forth below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of\nredemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date):\nPeriod: Percentage\nDecember 30, 2022 to December 29, 2023 102.00%\nDecember 30, 2023 to September 29, 2024 101.00%\nSeptember 30, 2024 to December 29, 2024 100.00%\nDue to the Redemption Prices, management intends to retire the 2022 Notes after September 29, 2024 and before the scheduled maturity date of December 30,\n2024.

In connection therewith, the Company will be utilizing investment bankers to serve\nas underwriters or placement agents for proposed offerings by the Company of its securities (including debt, common and/or preferred securities). The\nofferings would be of such size as to generate proceeds to the Company of no less than $19,500,000. The Company, subject to regulatory approval, may receive\ndistributions paid to it by KICO, its insurance subsidiary, that could be utilized to repay the 2022 Notes. Further, the Company may also use available invested\nassets and cash to repay a portion of the 2022 Notes. As of March 31, 2024, invested assets and cash was approximately $1,789,000.\nAs of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the Company is subject to a leverage maintenance\ntest (“Leverage Maintenance Test”), which requires that the Total Consolidated Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company not be greater than 30% of\nTotal Consolidated Capitalization (as defined below). As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the ratio as defined under the Leverage Maintenance Test\nwas 29.2% and 29.9%, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the ratio as defined under the Leverage Maintenance Test was 31.4%. On November 7, 2023, a\nmajority of the holders of the outstanding 2022 Notes (on behalf of all holders of the 2022 Notes) agreed to a waiver regarding the satisfaction of the Leverage\nMaintenance Test as of September 30, 2023. “Total Consolidated Indebtedness” is the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any\nIndebtedness issued with more than de minimis original issue discount) of all outstanding long-term of the Company except for the sale- leaseback transaction\ndescribed below under “Equipment Financing”, any refinancing or any future sale-leaseback transaction. “Total Consolidated Capitalization” is the amount\nequal to the sum of (x) Total Consolidated Indebtedness outstanding as of such date and (y) the total consolidated shareholders’ equity of the Company,\nexcluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, as recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.\n27\nTable of Contents\nEquipment Financing\nOn October 27, 2022, KICO entered into a sale-leaseback transaction, whereby KICO sold $8,096,824 of fixed assets to a bank. Under GAAP, the sale-\nleaseback transaction is recorded as equipment financing (“Financing”). The provisions of the Financing require KICO to pay a monthly payment of principal\nand interest at the rate of 5.86% per annum totaling $126,877 for a term of 60 months, which commenced on October 27, 2022. The terms of the Financing\nprovide buyout options to KICO at the end of the 60 month term, which are as follows:\n· At the end of the lease, KICO may purchase the fixed assets for a purchase price of $2,024,206, which is 25% of the original fixed asset cost of\n$8,096,824; or\n· KICO may renew the lease for 16 months at the same rental rate, which totals $2,030,036.\nA provision of the Financing requires KICO to pledge collateral for the lease obligation. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of required\ncollateral was approximately $6,576,000 and $6,999,000, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was approximately\n$6,576,000, consisting of approximately $5,969,000 in United States Treasury securities and the remaining balance of $607,000 in cash. As of December 31,\n2023, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral was approximately $11,960,000 in United States Treasury securities.\nFuture contractual payment obligations under the Financing as of March 31, 2024 are as follows:\nFor the Years\nEnding\nDecember 31, Total\nRemainder of 2024 $ 871,686\n2025 1,223,293\n2026 1,296,901\n2027 1,119,021\n4,510,901\n2027 purchase price 2,024,206\nTotal $ 6,535,107\nNote 8 – Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends Declared and Paid\nOn November 11, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends. Future dividend policy will be subject to the\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n28\nTable of Contents\n2014 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which a maximum of 700,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses. Incentive stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\n(except no later than five years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan,\nsubject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. On August 5, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan, including an increase in\nthe maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,400,000. On August 9, 2023,\nthe Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are\nauthorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,900,000. The 2014 Plan terminates on August 12, 2024 and no further awards may be granted under the\n2014 Plan after such date.\nAs of March 31, 2024, there were 118,329 shares reserved for grants under the 2014 Plan.\nStock Options\nThe results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include stock-based compensation expense for stock options totaling\napproximately $53,000 and $-0-, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is net of\nestimated forfeitures of approximately 12%. Such amounts have been included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nincome (loss) within other operating expenses.\nThe weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.24 per share. No options were\ngranted during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The fair value of stock options at the grant date was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and\nare fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.\nBecause the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input\nassumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of\nthe fair value of the Company’s stock options.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for grants during the following periods:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nDividend Yield 0.00% n/a\nVolatility 74.72% n/a\nRisk-Free Interest Rate 4.17% n/a\nExpected Life 3.50 years n/a\n29\nTable of Contents\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the three months ended March 31, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nNumber of Exercise Price Contractual Intrinsic\nStock Options Shares per Share Term Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 107,201 $ 8.31 0.94 $ -\nGranted 318,750 $ 2.25 4.73 $ 701,250\nExercised - $ - - $ -\nExpired/Forfeited (15,000) $ 2.25 4.88 $ 18,150\nOutstanding at March 31, 2024 410,951 $ 3.83 3.67 $ 668,250\nVested and Exercisable at March 31, 2024 107,201 $ 8.31 0.70 $ -\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at March 31, 2024 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the\nunderlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $4.45 closing price\nof the Company’s Common Stock on March 31, 2024. The total intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture. The total\nintrinsic value of options when expired are determined as of the date of expiration.\nParticipants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise\nissuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised, or by exchanging a number of shares owned\nfor a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of unamortized compensation cost related to 303,750 unvested stock option awards was approximately\n$270,000. Unamortized compensation cost as of March 31, 2024 is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.77 years.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the restricted Common Stock activity under the 2014 Plan for three months ended March 31, 2024 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nValue Aggregate\nRestricted Stock Awards Shares per Share Fair Value\nBalance at January 1, 2024 550,581 $ 3.82 $ 2,103,219\nGranted 163,617 $ 2.13 $ 348,504\nVested (233,627) $ 1.83 $ (427,537)\nForfeited (1,100) $ 4.80 $ (5,280)\nBalance at March 31, 2024 479,471 $ 4.21 $ 2,018,573\nFair value was calculated using the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,\nstock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $213,000 and $217,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). These amounts reflect the Company’s accounting expense\nand do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the directors, executives and employees.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the Exchange Agreement (see Note 7 – Debt – “Note and Warrant Exchange”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants to the Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. The fair value of the warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes. The fair value of the warrants is being\namortized over the life of the warrants, which is 36.5 months.\nThe warrants are exercisable through December 30, 2025 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the warrants may exercise their outstanding\nwarrants in cash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market\nvalue equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised.\nAs of March 31, 2024, all warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly-owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\n31\nTable of Contents\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nMarch 31, December 31,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 4,810,024 $ 5,283,016\nClaims reserve discount 1,221,272 1,204,334\nUnearned premium 3,165,074 2,742,603\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 1,950,921 1,986,782\nNet unrealized losses on securities 3,170,352 3,357,463\nOther 1,101,750 1,153,903\nTotal deferred tax assets 15,419,393 15,728,101\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,079,702 4,158,538\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 184,281 153,201\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,128,526 5,176,282\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 10,290,867 $ 10,551,819\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers (“NOL”) are as follows:\nMarch 31, December 31,\nType of NOL 2024 2023 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2023 and 2022 $ 4,810,024 $ 5,283,016 None\nState only (A) December 2027 - December\n2,645,169 2,560,372 2044\nValuation allowance (2,645,169) (2,560,372)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 4,810,024 $ 5,283,016\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of March 31, 2024 and December\n31, 2023 was approximately $40,695,000 and $39,390,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting subsidiary, is not subject to\nstate income taxes. KICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty\nof generating enough state taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs over their remaining lives, which expire between 2027 and\n2044.\n32\nTable of Contents\n(2) Deferred tax liability – Investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as\nCommercial Mutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property\nand casualty insurance company. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in consideration for the\nexchange of $3,750,000 principal amount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and unpaid interest on the surplus\nnotes as of the date of conversion. As of the date of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along with the accretion of the discount on\nthe original purchase of the surplus notes totaled $2,921,319 (together “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of acquisition, the deferred tax liability on\nthe Untaxed Interest was $1,169,000. A temporary difference with an indefinite life exists when the parent has a lower carrying value of its subsidiary\nfor income tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was reduced to $759,543 upon the reduction of federal income tax rates as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of $759,543 related to this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is sold, or the\nassets of KICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. If any had been recognized these would\nhave been reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022 remain subject to examination.\nNote 10 – Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock\noutstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise\nof stock options and warrants as well as non-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes those\noptions and warrants with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented.\nThe computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where\nthe exercise of such options and warrants or vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 there\nwere 120,553 options with an exercise price below the average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the period. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, no options, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have been\nanti-dilutive for the relevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per\ncommon share has not been adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\n33\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share\nfollows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2024 2023\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 10,999,662 10,756,913\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options 13,902 -\nWarrants 518,094 -\nRestricted stock awards 259,862 -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding, used for computing diluted loss per share 11,791,520 10,756,913\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy. Such proceedings are considered\nin estimating the liability for loss and LAE expenses.\nOffice Lease\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business. These leases are accounted\nfor as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company was a party to a non-cancellable operating lease, dated March 27, 2015, for its office facility for KICO located in Valley Stream, New York,\nwhich expired on March 31, 2024. The lease was not renewed.\n34\nTable of Contents\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s office operating leases is as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\nLease cost 2024 2023\nOperating lease $ 41,342 $ 40,815\nTotal lease cost $ 41,342 $ 40,815\nOther information on operating leases\nCash payments included in the measurement of lease liability reported in operating cash flows $ 49,145 $ 47,483\nDiscount rate 5.50% 5.50%\nRemaining lease term in years - 1.00\nRent expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $41,342 and $40,815, respectively, and is included in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses.\nEmployment Agreements\nMeryl Golden, President and Chief Executive Officer; formerly Chief Operating Officer (See Note 13 Subsequent Events)\nEmployment Agreement effective as of January 1, 2021\nOn September 16, 2019, the Company and Meryl Golden entered into an employment agreement (the “Golden Employment Agreement”) pursuant to which\nMs. Golden served as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer.

Goldstein, the Company’s then President, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board,\nentered into a Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the “Second Amended Goldstein Employment Agreement”). The Second Amended\nGoldstein Employment Agreement became effective as of January 1, 2020 and expired on December 31, 2022. The Second Amended Goldstein Employment\nAgreement extended the expiration date of the employment agreement in effect for Mr. Goldstein from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022.\nPursuant to the Second Amended Goldstein Employment Agreement, Mr. Goldstein was entitled to receive an annual base salary of $500,000 and an annual\nbonus equal to 6% of the Company’s consolidated income from operations before taxes, exclusive of the Company’s consolidated net investment income (loss),\nnet unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and net realized gains (losses) on investments, up to a maximum of 2.5 times his base salary. In addition,\npursuant to the Second Amended Goldstein Employment Agreement, Mr. Goldstein was entitled to receive a long-term compensation (“LTC”) award of\nbetween $945,000 and $2,835,000 based on a specified minimum increase in the Company’s adjusted book value per share (as defined in the Second Amended\nGoldstein Employment Agreement) as of December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2019 (with the maximum LTC payment being due if the average\nper annum increase was at least 14%).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is a New\nYork domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\n94.4% and 87.0% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the\nbusiness outside of New York as our “non-Core” business.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies\nit places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies are\nwritten for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nMarch 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of March 31, 2024, these expired policies represent\napproximately 15.1% of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional Financial Information”.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering\nits business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net\nunderwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and\nmay not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other\nfactors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to\nmateriality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not\nmaterialize.\n41\nTable of Contents\nApplication of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies.\nSee below a description of these critical accounting estimates. Also see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nProperty and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling both reported\n(“case”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and claims adjusting expenses. The liability for these reserves is estimated on an undiscounted basis,\nusing individual case-basis valuations and paid claims, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies. Due to the inherent\nuncertainty of the reserve process, actual loss costs could vary significantly compared to estimated loss costs. The below table provides detail of our reserves as\nof March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nAs of As of\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\n($ in thousands) Gross Ceded Net Gross Ceded Net\nCase loss $ 63,749 $ 17,904 $ 45,845 $ 67,108 $ 19,538 $ 47,570\nCase LAE 5,776 1,134 4,642 5,726 1,121 4,605\nIBNR loss 39,848 11,395 28,453 37,262 10,665 26,597\nIBNR LAE 13,126 2,291 10,835 11,722 1,965 9,757\nTotal $ 122,498 $ 32,724 $ 89,774 $ 121,818 $ 33,289 $ 88,529\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nCase Reserves – Reserves for reported losses are based on an estimate of ultimate loss costs of an individual claim derived from individual case-basis\nvaluations, actual claims paid, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies.\nIBNR Reserves – IBNR reserves are estimates of claims that have occurred but as to which we have not yet been notified to establish the case reserve.\nIBNR is determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance and adjusted to current conditions.\nReinsurance\nWe purchase reinsurance to manage our underwriting risk on certain policies. Reinsurance receivables represent management’s best estimate of loss\nand LAE recoverable from reinsurers. Reinsurance receivables are estimated using the same methodologies as loss and LAE reserves. Changes in the methods\nand assumptions used could result in significant variances between actual and estimated losses.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on GAAP income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Changes in\nestimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) could result in significant changes to our\ndeferred tax asset or liability.\n42\nTable of Contents\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences which result in differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. These assets and liabilities are carried at the enacted tax rates expected to apply when\nthe asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in estimates and assumptions in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss), or changes in the enacted tax rate, could result in significant variances between our carried deferred tax and tax recognized on\nthe recovery or settlement of the asset or liability.\nInvestments\nBonds are classified as held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”), and stocks are generally classified as AFS. Investments classified as\nHTM are carried at amortized cost, which requires very little judgement. Investments classified as AFS are generally carried at fair value with an unrealized\ngain/loss recorded in income. Actual results could vary significantly from the fair values recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nKingstone 2.0 (completed) and Kingstone 3.0 (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0”, were commenced to modernize our company. The pillars\nof the new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthen the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse backgrounds;\n2. Reduce expenses and increase efficiency by embracing technology, including converting to a new policy management system, retiring multiple\nlegacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Develop and implement a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk using advanced analytics\nand an abundance of data; and\n4. Better manage our catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our probable maximum loss (“PML”) in order to\nmitigate the impact of the then emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\n43\nTable of Contents\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we\ncoined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results, by slowing\nnew business, re-underwriting the book, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory constraints. We\nstopped writing all new non-Core business and have been aggressively reducing policy count. Our request to withdraw from the state of New\nJersey was acknowledged in October 2023 and all remaining policies will be non-renewed over a two year period starting January 1, 2024. As of\nMarch 31, 2024, our non-Core policy count was down by 52.1% compared to March 31, 2023;\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported in each state\nand product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value. Inflation has been a dominant headwind that is showing signs of stabilizing. We\nhave been cognizant that inflation’s impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and, as such, we have been more frequent and\naggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that same inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we\ncompleted our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes were insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums\nattributable to the heightened replacement costs. Overall average written premium for our legacy Core homeowners policies for the last 12 months,\nreflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 24.2%;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML. We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the required limit to be purchased\nwhile maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new business that was deemed to be too expensive and at\nthe same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the greatest risk. The combination of stricter new business underwriting\nand increased non-renewals gave rise to the 7.1% decline in policy count for our Core business. We have now reverted most of our new business\nunderwriting standards back to what they were previously so Core new business growth should increase going forward; and\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net expense ratio to 33% by year-end 2024. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we achieved our goal, with a net underwriting expense ratio of 32.9%. For the three months March 31, 2024, the net underwriting expense\nratio was 31.3%, a reduction of 3.4 points compared to the three months March 31, 2023.\nSee the tables for our Core and non-Core business for policies in force and direct written premiums as of and for the three months ended March 31,\n2024 and 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our Core direct written premiums increased by 12.5% compared to the three months ended March\n31, 2023, while Core policies in force decreased by 7.1% as of March 31, 2024. For the same periods, our non-Core policies in force decreased by 52.1% and\nnon-Core direct written premiums decreased by 55.6%. We believe that the above actions taken resulted in our return to profitability for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, will continue to have the intended effect and will continue through the remainder 2024 to result in a return to annual profitability.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(000’s except percentages and Policies in Force) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nPolicies In Force, as of end of Three Month Period\nCore 66,991 72,081 (5,090) (7.1)%\nNon-Core 9,080 18,945 (9,865) (52.1)%\nTotal policies in force 76,071 91,026 (14,955) (16.4)%\nDirect written premiums\nCore $ 46,587 $ 41,427 $ 5,160 12.5%\nNon-Core 2,738 6,170 (3,432) (55.6)%\nTotal direct written premiums $ 49,325 $ 47,597 $ 1,728 3.6%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n44\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2023\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 49,325 $ 47,597 $ 1,728 3.6%\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n49,325 47,597 1,728 3.6%\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 9,831 15,588 (5,757) (36.9)%\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 1,399 1,073 326 30.4%\nCeded to catastrophe treaties - (556) 556 (100.0)%\nTotal ceded written premiums 11,230 16,105 (4,875) (30.3)%\nNet written premiums 38,095 31,492 6,603 21.0%\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed 672 2,333 (1,661) (71.2)%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (1) (9,947) (5,570) (4,377) (78.6)%\nChange in net unearned premiums (9,275) (3,237) (6,038) (186.5)%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 49,996 49,930 66 0.1%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (21,176) (21,675) 499 2.3%\nNet premiums earned 28,820 28,255 565 2.0%\nCeding commission revenue (1) 4,567 5,445 (878) (16.1)%\nNet investment income 1,503 1,541 (38) (2.5)%\nNet gains on investments 726 1,225 (499) (40.7)%\nOther income 149 161 (12) (7.5)%\nTotal revenues 35,765 36,628 (863) (2.4)%\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 20,642 31,910 (11,268) (35.3)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 2,079 5,386 (3,307) (61.4)%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 22,720 37,296 (14,576) (39.1)%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 4,268 10,614 (6,346) (59.8)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 593 1,643 (1,050) (63.9)%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 4,861 12,257 (7,396) (60.3)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 16,374 21,296 (4,922) (23.1)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 1,486 3,743 (2,257) (60.3)%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 17,860 25,039 (7,179) (28.7)%\nCommission expense 7,852 8,540 (688) (8.1)%\nOther underwriting expenses 5,881 6,872 (991) (14.4)%\nOther operating expenses 778 663 115 17.3%\nDepreciation and amortization 597 808 (211) (26.1)%\nInterest expense 994 1,010 (16) (1.6)%\nTotal expenses 33,961 42,931 (8,970) (20.9)%\nIncome (loss) before taxes 1,805 (6,304) 8,109 na%\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 378 (1,249) 1,627 na%\nNet income (loss) $ 1,427 $ (5,055) $ 6,482 na%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2023, our personal lines business was subject a 30% quota share treaty, expiring on January 1, 2024, which\nincluded a runoff of an 8.5% portion through the remainder of 2023. Effective January 1, 2024, we entered into a 27% personal lines quota share\ntreaty, which includes a runoff of a 3.0% portion through the end of 2024.\n(2) The three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe\nbulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO).

The increase of $1,728,000, or 3.6%, was primarily due to an increase in premiums from our\npersonal lines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Three Months 2024 were $45,740,000, an increase of $1,569,000, or 3.5%, from\n$44,171,000 in Three Months 2023. The 3.5% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the increase in premiums associated\nwith our Core business of 13.2% offsetting a 55.6% decrease in our non-Core business. The increase in our Core business premiums and the decrease in our\nnon-Core business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Three Months 2024 were $3,562,000, an increase of $156,000, or 4.6%, from\n$3,406,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an increase\nin the values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $46,587,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $41,427,000 in Three Months 2023, an\nincrease of $5,160,000, or 12.5%. The increase in direct written premiums from our Core business was due to rate increases, offset by a decrease in policies in\nforce. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 7.1% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. Direct written premiums from our\nnon-Core business were $2,738,000 in Three Months 2024 down from $6,170,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $3,432,000, or 55.6%. The decrease in\ndirect written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force\nfrom our non-Core business decreased by 52.1% in Three Months 2024 compared to Three Months 2023. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in\nour non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n46\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums increased $6,603,000, or 21.0%, to $38,095,000 in Three Months 2024 from $31,492,000 in Three Months 2023. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe increase in Three Months 2024 is primarily due to changes to our personal lines quota share reinsurance treaty. See quota share reinsurance treaties\ndiscussion below.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nOn January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1,\n2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”). In Three Months\n2024, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties decreased by $5,757,000 in comparison to premiums ceded under quota share treaties in Three Months\n2023 (see table above). The decrease in Three Months 2024 was attributable to the decrease in quota share rates and by the runoff in Three Months 2023 of an\n8.5% portion of a 30% quota share treaty that was in effect through January 1, 2024 (“2021-2023 Treaty”). Our personal lines business was subject to the\n2024/2025 Treaty in Three Months 2024, and the 2023/2024 Treaty in Three Months 2023.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Three Months 2024, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $326,000 over the comparable ceded excess of loss premiums for Three Months 2023. The increase was due to an increase\nin subject premiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2023, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty\n(the “Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. The treaty provided 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of\n$400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms were excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2024, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed\ncovering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. On July 1, 2023 and 2022, we recorded our catastrophe premiums for the entire treaty period covering July 1 through June 30, resulting in the entire\nannual premium being recorded in the third quarter. The $556,000 negative catastrophe premium in Three Months 2023 was due to a true-up of premiums\noriginally recorded on July 1, 2022.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $565,000, or 2.0%, to $28,820,000 in Three Months 2024 from $28,255,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase was\ndue to the three point reduction in quota share rates discussed above, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the premiums ceded and\nreduced the net premiums earned in Three Months 2023, offset by an increase in catastrophe premium rates, reflected in ceded catastrophe premiums earned,\nwhich reduced the amount of growth in net premiums earned.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended March 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,555 $ 5,447 $ (892) (16.4)%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 12 (1) 13 na%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 4,567 $ 5,445 $ (878) (16.1)%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nCeding commission revenue was $4,567,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $5,445,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $878,000 is\nexplained below in the discussion of provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Three Months 2024, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,555,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2024/2025\nTreaty, and in Three Months 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $5,447,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty. The decrease of $892,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the decrease in premiums ceded under these treaties during Three\nMonths 2024 compared to Three Months 2023, offset by an increase in ceding commission rates under the 2024/2025 Treaty.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2024/2025 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $1,503,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $1,541,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $38,000, or 2.5%. The\naverage yield on non-cash invested assets was 3.77% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 3.35% as of March 31, 2023.\nCash and invested assets were $189,109,000 as of March 31, 2024 compared to $190,665,000 as of March 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,556,000.\nNet Gains on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $726,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to net gains of $1,225,000 in Three Months 2023. Unrealized gains on our\nequity securities and other investments in Three Months 2024 were $819,000, compared to unrealized gains of $1,228,000 in Three Months 2023. Net realized\n(losses) on sales of investments were $(92,000) in Three Months 2024 compared to net realized (losses) of $(3,000) in Three Months 2023.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOther Income\nOther income was $149,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $161,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $12,000, or 7.5%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $17,860,000 for Three Months 2024 compared to $25,039,000 for Three Months 2023. The net loss ratio was 62.0% in Three\nMonths 2024 compared to 88.6% in Three Months 2023, a decrease of 26.6 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nThe loss ratio for Three Months 2024 improved significantly compared to Three Months 2023. For Three Months 2024, the catastrophe impact, prior\nyear development, and underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) were all lower than Three Months\n2023.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThere were six newly designated catastrophe events for Three Months 2024. The estimated total net catastrophe losses for the calendar quarter were\n$1,486,000, which contributed 5.2 points to the loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Three Months 2023 was 13.2 points. Losses from winter-\nrelated catastrophe claims were minimal during Three Months 2024, whereas the previous year was impacted by a major winter event in February 2023.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 58.8% for Three Months 2024, a decrease of 16.6 points from the 75.4% underlying loss ratio recorded for Three\nMonths 2023. Overall non-catastrophe frequency and severity for Three Months 2024 were both lower than for Three Months 2023.\nThere was favorable prior year development of $566,000 during Three Months 2024, which translates to a 2.0 point decrease to the loss ratio. By\ncomparison, the impact of prior year development for Three Months 2023 was negligible. The favorable development in Three Months 2024 is mainly driven\nby the re-evaluation of the catastrophe events from the third quarter of 2023.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $7,852,000 in Three Months 2024 or 15.7% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $8,540,000 in Three\nMonth 2023 or 17.1% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $688,000 was primarily due to a reduction in commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with our Kingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products. The decrease was\noffset by an accrual of $303,000 for an estimated contingent commission to be recalculated quarterly if we continue to be profitable for the remainder of the\nyear.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $5,881,000, or 11.8% of direct earned premiums, in Three Months 2024 compared to $6,872,000, or 13.8% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $991,000, or 14.4%, was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employment costs as\ndescribed below, policy management system fees as result of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple\nlegacy systems, and other IT costs as a result of the completion of these projects. The decreases were partially offset by the impact of high inflation.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $2,601,000 in Three Months 2024\ncompared to $2,933,000 in Three Months Ended 2023. The decrease of $332,000, or 11.3%, is favorable when compared to the 3.6% increase in direct written\npremiums. The decrease in salaries and employment costs was due to a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we have been reducing our non-Core\nbusiness. The decrease from the reduction in staff was partially offset in the periods following Three Months 2023, as we began to strengthen our professional\nteam by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0\nand Kingstone 3.0 strategies.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Three Months 2024 was 31.3% compared to 34.7% in Three Months 2023.

The increase in employment costs was due to fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying\ninvested portfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $597,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $808,000 in Three Months 2023. The decrease of $211,000, or\n26.1%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Three Months 2024 was $994,000 compared to $1,010,000 in Three Months 2023, a decrease of $16,000 or 1.6%. In Three Months\n2024 and Three Months 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred interest expense in connection with the\n2022 Notes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nIncome tax expense in Three Months 2024 was $378,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.93%. Income tax (benefit) in Three Months\n2023 was $(1,249,000), which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.8%. Income before taxes was $1,805,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to a loss before\ntaxes of $6,304,000 in Three Months 2023. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Three Months 2024 compared to\nThree Months 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income was $1,427,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to loss of $5,055,000 in Three Months 2023. The increase from net loss to net income of\n$6,482,000 was due to the circumstances described above.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources\n(“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or\nunavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs.

Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary\nincluded credit quality considerations, the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and interest rate\nenvironment factors, management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments\nbefore anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends and distributions received from KICO, which are subject to statutory\nrestrictions. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, KICO did not pay any dividends to us. As of March 31, 2024, KICO had a negative unassigned\nsurplus and currently will not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. In December 2023, KICO received regulatory approval to\npay us a $2,300,000 distribution from paid in capital. KICO intends to pay us the $2,300,000 distribution in the second quarter of 2024.\nKICO is a member of the FHLBNY, which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of\nKICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is December 31, 2023. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew KICO’s ratings as KICO\nrequested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO is currently only able to\nborrow on an overnight basis. The maximum allowable advance as of March 31, 2024, based on the net admitted assets as of December 31, 2023, was\napproximately $12,512,000. Available collateral as of March 31, 2024 was approximately $10,929,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available\ncollateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during Three Months 2024.\nOn December 15, 2022, we issued $19,950,000 of our 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. We are required to make semi-annual interest\npayments in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is December 30, 2024.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company debt service and other cash requirements,\nwe will seek to obtain additional financing. See Notes 2 and 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for a\ndiscussion of our plans in this regard.\n64\nTable of Contents\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nThree Months ended March 31, 2024 2023\nCash flows (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ 6,098,220 $ (3,366,805)\nInvesting activities (11,587,350) 2,189,590\nFinancing activities (288,568) (280,260)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (5,777,698) (1,457,475)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 8,976,998 11,958,228\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 3,199,300 $ 10,500,753\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $6,098,000 in Three Months 2024 as compared to $3,367,000 used in operating activities in Three\nMonths 2023. The $9,645,000 increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in Three Months 2024 as compared to Three Months 2023 was primarily\nthe result of an increase in net income from net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of $8,410,000 and in cash provided arising from net fluctuations in operating\nassets and liabilities. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations,\npayments on claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash used by investing activities was $11,587,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $2,190,000 provided by investing activities in Three\nMonths 2023 resulting in a $13,777,000 increase in net cash used by investing activities. In Three Months 2024, we had net cash provided by our investment\nportfolio of $34,579,000, compared to $13,630,000 used in Three Months 2023.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $289,000 in Three Months 2024 compared to $280,000 used in Three Months 2023. Net cash used in\nfinancing activities are primarily principal payments on equipment financing debt in connection with KICO’s sale-leaseback transaction.\nReinsurance\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consisted of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27%\nquota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”).\nWe entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties effective July 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an\nunderlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying\nXOL Treaty provided 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the Underlying\nXOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024.

We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where\nhistorical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nWhile the rate of inflation has moderated in 2024, Three Months 2024 still include the continuing effects of prior years’ economic inflation, which\nresulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower public equity valuations, and significant financial market volatility. The\nhigher interest rates and widening of credit spreads reduced the value of our fixed income securities in Three Months 2024, which lowered our stockholders’\nequity. For Three Months 2024, the continuing effects of prior economic inflation impacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends\ncontinue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively impact our results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\n67\nTable of Contents\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return. This action\nhas led, and may continue to lead, to a slowdown in premium growth compared to the higher growth we had seen in prior years, particularly in new business.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThis item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to assure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were: (i) effective in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on\nthis evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31,\n2024.\n68\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n69\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Previous guidance was presented on a diluted shares basis, while current guidance is presented on a basic shares basis.\nThe guidance provided above is based on information available as of May 13, 2024, and management's review of the anticipated financial results for 2024. Such guidance remains subject to change based\non management's ongoing review of the Company's 2024 results and is a forward-looking statement (see “Forward-Looking Statements”). Kingstone assumes no obligation to update this guidance. The\nactual results may be materially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in the press release accompanying this presentation and in Kingstone's annual and quarterly filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES 20\nDirect premiums written represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period.\nNet premiums written are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written,\nare net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net premiums written,\nalong with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct premiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums\nearned, and do not reflect the Company’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP\nmeasure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and\namortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss)\nand does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and basic income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and basic net income (loss)\nper share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains\n(losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and basic operating income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and\nbasic net income (loss) per share and do not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income\n(loss) per share are the GAAP measures most closely comparable to operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains\n(losses) on investments and may vary significantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and\ndiluted net income (loss) per share, and do not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company’s overall return on average common equity.\nUnderlying loss ratio is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio less the impacts of prior year loss reserve development and catastrophes losses.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors, and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by prior year loss reserve development and catastrophe losses.\nCatastrophe losses cause the Company’s loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio.

Net premiums written are direct premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurers.\nNet premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums\nwritten, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the\nCompany’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net\npremiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct\npremiums written and net premiums written are provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for\nnet premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation\nand amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based compensation. Net income (loss) is the\nGAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and\nevaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit),\ndepreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Adjusted EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for\nnet income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income\n(loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax. Net income (loss) and diluted net income\n(loss) per share is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating income (loss) and diluted operating\nincome (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share along with other\nmeasures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net\ngains (losses) on investments, and may vary significantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and diluted\noperating income (loss) per share is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income\n(loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP\nmeasure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance\nand evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, which may vary\nsignificantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a\nsubstitute for return on equity and does not reflect the Company’s overall return on average common equity.\nNet loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference\nbetween GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss ratio.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in\nthe Company’s business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses cause the Company’s\nloss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and\ncan have a significant impact on the net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors\nto evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company’s underwriting performance.

The events described in forward‑looking statements contained in this Annual Report may not occur. Generally, these statements relate to business\nplans or strategies, projected or anticipated results or other consequences of our plans or strategies, projected or anticipated results from acquisitions to be made\nby us, or projections involving anticipated revenues, earnings, costs or other aspects of our operating results. The words “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,”\n“anticipate,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “estimate,” and “continue,” and their opposites and similar expressions are intended to identify forward‑looking\nstatements. We caution you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and\nother influences, many of which are beyond our control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are\nbased. Factors which may cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements include, but are not\nlimited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed in Part I Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) of this Annual Report.\nAny one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect our results of operations and whether forward‑looking statements\nmade by us ultimately prove to be accurate. Our actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these\nforward‑looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether from new information, future\nevents or otherwise except as required by law.\n3\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1. BUSINESS.\n(a) Business Development\nGeneral\nAs used in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Kingstone Companies, Inc. (“Kingstone”) and its\nsubsidiaries.\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is a New\nYork domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, 88.3%\nand 80.6% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business\noutside of New York as our “non-Core” business.\nIn addition, through our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, we access alternative distribution channels. See\n“Distribution” below for a discussion of our distribution channels. Cosi receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays\ncommissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense paid. Net Cosi revenue is\ndeducted against commission expense and Cosi-related expenses are included in other operating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in\nour stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, its expenses are not included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below.\nRecent Developments\nDevelopments During 2023\n· Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage\nEffective July 1, 2023, KICO decreased the top limit of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage from $345,000,000 to $325,000,000, which, at the time,\nequated to more than a 1-in-100 year storm event according to the primary industry catastrophe model that we follow.\n· A.M. Best Rating\nOn July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew KICO’s ratings as KICO requested to no longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process.\n· Withdrawal from New Jersey\nOn October 2, 2023, the New Jersey Department of Banking & Insurance acknowledged KICO’s request to withdraw from the state effective January\n1, 2024. The Department requested that KICO complete the withdrawal over a two year period.\n4\nTable of Contents\nDevelopments During 2022\n· Debt Exchange\nOn December 9, 2022, we entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “Exchanging\nNoteholders”) of our outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders held\n2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes then outstanding.\nAt the closing of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for, among other things, new 12.0%\nSenior Notes due December 30, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $19,950,000 (the “2022 Notes”).\n· Catastrophe Reinsurance Coverage\nEffective July 1, 2022, KICO decreased the top limit of its catastrophe reinsurance coverage from $500,000,000 to $345,000,000, which, at the time,\nequated to more than a 1-in-100 year storm event according to the primary industry catastrophe model that we follow.\n· A.M. Best Rating\nIn July 2022, A.M. Best downgraded KICO’s financial strength rating from B+ (Good) to B (Fair) and Long-Term Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) from\n“bbb-” (Good) to “bb” (Fair) due to a significant deterioration in KICO’s risk-adjusted capitalization. Such deterioration was driven by a sizeable increase in\nKICO’s net probable maximum loss (“PML”) as a result of its latest reinsurance renewal and a decline in surplus from weather-related losses and dividend\npayments by KICO in 2022. The outlook for each of these credit ratings was revised to “negative” from “stable”. Concurrently, A.M. Best’s public rating for\nKingstone Companies, Inc. was withdrawn.\n(b) Business\nProperty and Casualty Insurance\nOverview\nProperty and casualty insurance companies provide policies in exchange for premiums paid by their customers (the “insureds”). An insurance policy is\na contract between the insurance company and its insureds where the insurance company agrees to pay for losses that are covered under the contract. Such\ncontracts are subject to legal interpretation by courts, sometimes involving legislative rulings and/or arbitration. Property insurance generally covers the\nfinancial consequences of accidental losses to the insured’s property, such as a home and the personal property in it, or a business owner’s building, inventory\nand equipment. Casualty insurance (also referred to as liability insurance) generally covers the financial consequences related to the legal liability of an\nindividual or an organization resulting from negligent acts and omissions that cause bodily injury and/or property damage to a third party. Claims for property\ncoverage generally are reported and settled in a relatively short period of time, whereas those for casualty coverage may take many years to settle.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, including revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance,\nnet investment income generated from our investment portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. We also collect a variety of policy\nfees including installment fees, reinstatement fees, and non-sufficient fund fees related to situations involving extended premium payment plans. Earned\npremiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the\nlife of the policy). All of our policies are 12 month policies; therefore, a significant period of time can elapse between the receipt of insurance premiums and\nthe payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earning investment income and generating net realized and unrealized gains\nand losses on associated investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nThe key measure of relative underwriting performance for an insurance company is the combined ratio. An insurance company’s combined ratio is\ncalculated by taking the ratio of incurred loss and LAE to earned premiums (the “loss and LAE ratio”) and adding it to the ratio of policy acquisition and other\nunderwriting expenses to earned premiums (the “expense ratio”). A combined ratio under 100% indicates that an insurance company is generating an\nunderwriting profit prior to the impact of investment income. After considering investment income and investment gains or losses, insurance companies\noperating at a combined ratio of greater than 100% can also be profitable.\nBusiness; Strategy\nWe are a multi-line regional property and casualty insurance company writing business exclusively through retail and wholesale agents and brokers\n(“producers”) appointed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, KICO. We are licensed to write insurance policies in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Maine,\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. KICO is actively writing its property and casualty insurance products in New York.\nAdditionally, our subsidiary, Cosi, a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and\npays commissions to these agencies.\nWe seek to deliver an attractive return on capital and to provide consistent earnings growth through underwriting profits and income from our\ninvestment portfolio. Our goal is to allocate capital efficiently to those lines of business that generate sustainable underwriting profits and to avoid lines of\nbusiness for which an underwriting profit is not likely. Our strategy is to be the preferred multi-line property and casualty insurance company for selected\nproducers in the geographic markets in which we operate. We believe producers place profitable business with us because we provide excellent, consistent\nservice to insureds and claimants. Producers also value our broad underwriting appetite coupled with competitive rate and commission structures.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur principal objectives are to grow profitably while managing risk through prudent use of reinsurance in order to strengthen our capital base. We\ngenerate underwriting income through adequate pricing of insurance policies and by effectively managing our other underwriting and operating expenses. We\nare pursuing profitable growth through existing producers in existing markets, by developing new geographic markets and producer relationships, and by\nintroducing niche products that are relevant to our producers and insureds.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our gross written premiums totaled $200.2 million, a decrease of 0.5% from the $201.2 million in gross written\npremiums for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines - Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies. Personal lines policies accounted for 92.6% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLivery physical damage - We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included. These policies accounted for 7.3% of our gross\nwritten premiums for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther - We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations. These policies\naccounted for 0.1% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nLong History of Operations\nKICO has been in operation in the State of New York since 1886. We have consistently sought to grow the amount of profitable business that we write\nby introducing new products, increasing volume written with our Select producers in existing markets, and developing new producer relationships and markets.\nThe extensive heritage of our insurance company subsidiary and our commitment to the markets in which we operate is a competitive advantage with\nproducers and insureds.\nStrong Producer Relationships\nWithin our producers’ offices, we compete with other property and casualty insurance carriers available to those producers. We carefully select the\nproducers that distribute our insurance policies and continuously monitor and evaluate their performance. We believe our insurance producers value their\nrelationships with us because we provide excellent, consistent personal service coupled with competitive rates and commission levels. We have consistently\nbeen rated by insurance producers as above average in the important areas of underwriting, claims handling and service.\n7\nTable of Contents\nWe offer our Select producers access to a variety of personal lines and specialty products, including some that are unique to us. We provide a multi-\npolicy discount on homeowners policies in order to attract and retain more of this multi-line business. We have had a consistent presence in the New York\nmarket and our producers value the longevity of the relationship. We believe that the excellent service provided to our Select producers, our broad product\nofferings, and our competitive prices provide a strong foundation for profitable growth.\nSophisticated Pricing, Underwriting and Risk Management Practices\nWe believe that a significant underwriting advantage exists due to our local market presence and expertise. Our underwriting process evaluates and\nscreens out certain risks based on their prior loss experience, cost of reinsurance, property condition, insurance scoring and driving record, and then is\naugmented by information collected from physical property inspections. We maintain certain policy exclusions that reduce our exposure to risks that can create\nsevere losses. We target a preferred risk profile in order to reduce adverse selection from risks seeking the lowest premiums and minimal coverage levels.\nOur underwriting procedures, premiums and policy terms support the goal of underwriting profitability of our personal lines policies. We adhere to a\nquarterly indication process and perform a rate review in each state and for each product at least annually. In 2022, we introduced our new Select homeowners,\ncondo/tenant and dwelling fire programs in New York. This product incorporates by-peril rating and a host of new data sources to better match rate to risk. We\nhave also updated property replacement costs to address inflation.\nWe manage coastal risk exposure through the use of individual catastrophe risk scoring, the inclusion of hurricane deductibles, non-renewals and the\nprudent use of reinsurance. We measure our risk exposure regularly and adjust our underwriting to manage growth in our probable maximum loss (PML).\nEffective Utilization of Reinsurance\nOur reinsurance treaties allow us to limit our exposure to the financial impact of catastrophe losses and to reduce our net liability on individual risks.\nOur reinsurance program is structured to enable us to grow our premium volume while maintaining regulatory capital and other financial ratios within\nthresholds used for regulatory oversight purposes.\nOur reinsurance program also provides income from ceding commissions earned pursuant to quota share reinsurance contracts. The income we earn\nfrom ceding commissions subsidizes our fixed operating costs, which consist of other underwriting expenses. Quota share reinsurance treaties transfer a portion\nof the profit (or loss) associated with the subject insurance policies to the reinsurers.\nScalable, Low-Cost Operations\nWe focus on efficiently managing our expenses and invest in tools and processes that improve the effectiveness of underwriting risks and processing\nclaims. We evaluate the costs and benefits of each new tool or process in order to achieve optimal results. While the majority of our policies are written for\nrisks in downstate New York, our Kingston, New York location provides a low-cost operating environment.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe continue to invest in improving our online application and quoting systems for our personal lines products. We have leveraged a paperless\nworkflow management and document storage tool that has improved efficiency and reduced costs. We provide an online payment portal that allows producers\nand insureds to make payments and to view policy information for all of our products in one location. Our ability to control the growth of operating and other\nexpenses while expanding our operations and growing revenue is a key component of our business model and is important to our financial success.\nIn 2022, we completed the implementation of Kingstone 2.0, an effort to modernize the Company. Kingstone 2.0 included strategic hiring,\ndevelopment of the Select product, investments in new systems and retirement of the legacy systems. We also adopted a framework of stronger rating,\nunderwriting and catastrophe management disciplines. As a result, Kingstone 2.0 positioned the Company to be better able to navigate today’s challenging\nenvironment. In 2023, we embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we coined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new\nstrategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results.\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation.\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML.\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net expense ratio to 33% by year-end 2024.\nSee detailed description of Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 in Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations) in this Annual Report.\nUnderwriting and Claims Management Philosophy\nOur underwriting philosophy is to target niche segments for which we have detailed expertise and can take advantage of market conditions. We\nmonitor results on a regular basis and our Select producers are reviewed by management on at least a semi-annual basis.\nWe believe that our rates are appropriately competitive with other carriers in our target markets. We do not seek to grow by competing based solely\nupon price. We seek to develop long-term relationships with our Select producers who understand and appreciate the path we have chosen. We carefully\nunderwrite our business utilizing industry claims databases, insurance scoring reports, physical inspection of risks and other individual risk underwriting tools.\nWe write homeowners and dwelling fire business in coastal markets and are cognizant of our exposure to hurricanes. We have mitigated this risk through\nappropriate catastrophe reinsurance and application of hurricane deductibles. We handle claims fairly while ensuring that coverage provisions and exclusions\nare properly applied. Our claims and underwriting expertise supports our ability to grow our profitable business.\nDistribution\nWe generate business through our relationships with over 700 producers. We carefully select our producers by evaluating numerous factors such as\ntheir need for our products, premium production potential, loss history with other insurance companies that they represent, product and market knowledge, and\nagency size. We only distribute through agents and have never sought to distribute our products direct to the consumer. We monitor and evaluate the\nperformance of our producers through periodic reviews of volume and profitability. Our senior executives are actively involved in managing our producer\nrelationships.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEach producer is assigned to a staff underwriter and the producer can call that underwriter directly on any matter. We believe that the close relationship\nand personal service received from their underwriters is a principal reason producers place their business with us. Our producers have access to a KICO\nproducer interface and website portal that provides them the ability to quote risks for various products and to review policy forms and underwriting guidelines\nfor all lines of business. We send out frequent “Producer Grams” in order to inform our producers of updates at KICO.\nCompetition; Market\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. We constantly assess and make projections of market conditions and appropriate prices for our products,\nbut we cannot fully know our profitability until all claims have been reported and settled.\nOur active policyholders are located primarily in the downstate regions of New York State, our Core business. Under Kingstone 3.0, we are reducing\nour non-Core Northeast markets, which include New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. In addition, we are licensed to write insurance\npolicies in Maine, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.\nIn 2022, we made the decision to reduce our footprint outside New York due to profitability concerns. We entered these states to diversify Kingstone’s\nfootprint starting in 2017, and they have had a disproportionate impact on our underwriting results, especially in 2022. We have attempted to address these\nchallenges and achieve profitability with a series of rate and underwriting actions, but the impact we have worked towards was largely nullified by inflation. In\naddition to a new business moratorium in our non-Core states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island, we have been actively non-\nrenewing policies subject to regulatory constraints and have materially lowered commission rates to our producers. Subject to our withdrawal agreement with\nthe state of New Jersey, we will be non-renewing our entire book in such state over a two year period starting January 1, 2024. These actions reduced the size\nof our policies in force outside New York by 48% in 2023.\nIn 2023, KICO was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in the State of New York, according to data compiled by S&P Capital IQ. Based\non the same data, in 2023, we had a 1.6% market share for this business. We compete with large national carriers as well as regional and local carriers in the\nproperty and casualty marketplace in New York and other states. We believe that many national and regional carriers have chosen to limit their rate of premium\ngrowth or to decrease their presence in Northeastern states due to the relatively high coastal population and associated catastrophe risk that exists in the region.\nAdditionally, some of our largest competitors historically have stopped writing business this year.\n10\nTable of Contents\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nWe are required to establish reserves for unpaid losses, including reserves for claims loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”), which represent the expenses\nof settling and adjusting those claims. These reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss\nexpenses for claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date, whether already known to us or not yet reported. We establish these reserves after\nconsidering all information known to us as of the date they are recorded.\nLoss reserves fall into two categories: case reserves for reported losses and LAE associated with specific reported claims, and reserves for losses and\nLAE that are incurred but not reported. We establish these two categories of loss reserves as follows:\nReserves for reported losses - When a claim is received, we establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of its ultimate settlement and its\nestimated loss expenses. We establish case reserves based upon the known facts about each claim at the time it is received and we may subsequently adjust case\nreserves as additional facts and information about the claim develops.\nIBNR reserves - We also estimate reserves for loss and LAE amounts incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). IBNR reserves are calculated in bulk as an\nestimate of ultimate losses and LAE less reported losses and LAE. There are two types of IBNR; the first is a provision for claims that have occurred but are\nnot yet reported or known. We refer to this as ‘Pure’ IBNR, and due to the fact that we write primarily quickly reported property lines of business, this type of\nIBNR does not make up a large portion of KICO’s total IBNR. The second type of IBNR is a provision for expected future development on known claims,\nfrom the evaluation date until the time claims are settled and closed. We refer to this as ‘Case Development’ IBNR and it makes up the majority of the IBNR\nthat KICO records. Ultimate losses driving the determination of appropriate IBNR levels are projected by using generally accepted actuarial techniques.\nThe liability for loss and LAE represents our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses that are unpaid as of the balance\nsheet evaluation date. The liability for loss and LAE is estimated on an undiscounted basis, using individual case-based valuations, statistical analyses, and\nvarious actuarial procedures. The projection of future claim payments and reporting patterns is based on an analysis of our historical experience, supplemented\nby analyses of industry loss data. We believe that the reserves for loss and LAE are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims to date. However,\nbecause of uncertainty from various sources, including changes in claims settlement patterns and handling procedures, litigation trends, judicial decisions, and\neconomic conditions, actual loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liabilities at the balance\nsheet date. As adjustments to these estimates become necessary, they are reflected in the period in which the estimates are changed. Because of the nature of the\nbusiness historically written, we believe that we have limited exposure to asbestos and environmental claim liabilities.\nWe engage an independent external actuarial specialist (the “Appointed Actuary”) to opine on our recorded statutory reserves. The Appointed Actuary\nestimates a range of ultimate losses, along with a range and recommended central estimate of IBNR reserve amounts. Our carried IBNR reserves are based on\nan internal actuarial analysis and reflect management’s best estimate of unpaid loss and LAE liabilities, and fall within the range of those determined as\nreasonable by the Appointed Actuary.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Principal Revenue and Expense Items” in Item 7 of\nthis Annual Report and Note 2 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information and details regarding loss and\nLAE reserves.\n11\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nThe table below shows the reconciliation of loss and LAE on a gross and net basis, reflecting changes in losses incurred and paid losses:\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of period $ 118,339,513 $ 94,948,745\nLess reinsurance recoverables (27,659,500) (10,637,679)\nNet balance, beginning of period 90,680,013 84,311,066\nIncurred related to:\nCurrent year 82,856,483 85,690,180\nPrior years (7,273) 2,699,862\nTotal incurred 82,849,210 88,390,042\nPaid related to:\nCurrent year 49,146,173 49,602,585\nPrior years 35,853,838 32,418,510\nTotal paid 85,000,011 82,021,095\nNet balance at end of period 88,529,212 90,680,013\nAdd reinsurance recoverables 33,288,650 27,659,500\nBalance at end of period $ 121,817,862 $ 118,339,513\nOur claims reserving practices are designed to set reserves that, in the aggregate, are adequate to pay all claims at their ultimate settlement value.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development\nThe table below shows the net loss development of reserves held as of each calendar year-end from 2013 through 2023.\nThe first section of the table reflects the changes in our loss and LAE reserves after each subsequent calendar year of development. The table displays\nthe re-estimated values of incurred losses and LAE at each succeeding calendar year-end, including payments made during the years indicated. The second\nsection of the table shows by year the cumulative amounts of loss and LAE payments, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, as of the end of each\nsucceeding year. An example with respect to the net loss and LAE reserves of $17,139,000 as of December 31, 2013 is as follows. By December 31, 2015 (two\nyears later), $10,629,000 had actually been paid in settlement of the claims that relate to liabilities as of December 31, 2013. The re-estimated ultimate reserves\ntwo years later for those claims as of December 31, 2013 had grown to $18,332,000.\nThe “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents, as of December 31, 2023, the difference between the latest re-estimated liability and the\namounts as originally estimated. A redundancy means that the original estimate was higher than the current estimate.

Our reinsurance program is structured to reflect our obligations and goals.\nReinsurance via quota share allows a carrier to write business without increasing its underwriting leverage above a level determined by management.\nThe business written under a quota share reinsurance structure obligates a reinsurer to assume some portion of the risks involved, and gives the reinsurer the\nprofit (or loss) associated with such in exchange for a ceding commission.\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”).Upon the expiration of the 2023/2024 Treaty on January 1, 2024, we entered into a new 27%\nquota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025 (“2024/2025 Treaty”).\nExcess of loss contracts provide coverage for individual loss occurrences exceeding a certain threshold. The quota share reinsurance treaties inure to\nthe benefit of our excess of loss treaties, as the maximum net retention on any single risk occurrence is first limited through the excess of loss treaty, and then\nthat loss is shared again through the quota share reinsurance treaty. Our maximum net retention under the 2021/2023 Treaty and excess of loss treaties for any\none personal lines occurrence for dates of loss on or after December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2024 was $700,000. Effective January 1, 2024 through\nJanuary 1, 2025, our maximum net retention under the 2024/2025 Treaty increased to $730,000. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying\nexcess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying XOL Treaty\nprovides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses, other than from a named storm, of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying\nXOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024. From January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2024, under the\nUnderlying XOL Treaty, our maximum net retention for any one personal lines occurrence was further reduced from the retention of $700,000 under the\n2021/2023 Treaty and the 2023/2024 Treaty to $500,000. From January 1, 2024 through January 1, 2025, under the Underlying XOL Treaty, our maximum net\nretention for any one personal lines occurrence was reduced from the retention of $730,000 under 2024/2025 Treaty to $530,000.\nWe previously earned ceding commission revenue under the quota share reinsurance treaties based on a provisional commission rate on all premiums\nceded to the reinsurers as adjusted by a sliding scale based on the ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each agreement. The sliding\nscale provided minimum and maximum ceding commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. Under the 2021/2023 Treaty and the 2023/24\nTreaty, KICO received a fixed provisional rate with no adjustment for sliding scale contingent commissions. Under the 2024/2025 Treaty, KICO will receive a\nfixed provisional rate with no adjustment for sliding scale contingent commissions.\nThe 2021/2023 Treaty, 2023/2024 Treaty and 2024/2025 Treaty are on a “net” of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the “gross” arrangement\nthat existed in prior treaties. Under a “net” arrangement, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased directly by us. Since we pay for all of the\ncatastrophe coverage, none of the losses covered under a catastrophic event will be included in the quota share ceded amounts.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIn 2023, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance to provide coverage of up to $325,000,000 for losses associated with a single event. One of the most\ncommonly used catastrophe forecasting models prepared for us indicates that the catastrophe reinsurance treaties provide coverage in excess of our estimated\nprobable maximum loss associated with a single more than one-in-100 year storm event. Effective December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023, losses on\npersonal lines policies are subject to the 2021/2023 Treaty, which covered 26% of catastrophe losses and resulted in a net retention by us of $7,400,000 of\nexposure per catastrophe occurrence. Effective January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024, losses on personal lines policies were subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty,\nwhich covered 12.5% of catastrophe losses and resulted in a net retention by us of $8,750,000 of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. Effective January 1,\n2024 through January 1, 2025, losses on personal lines policies will be subject to the 2024/2025 Treaty, which will cover 5.0% of catastrophe losses and will\nresult in a net retention by us of $9,500,000 of exposure per catastrophe occurrence. From July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022, we had reinstatement premium\nprotection on the first $70,000,000 layer of catastrophe coverage in excess of $10,000,000. Effective July 1, 2022 and through June 30, 2023, we had\nreinstatement premium protection for $9,800,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $10,000,000. Effective July 1, 2023 and through June 30, 2024, we have\nreinstatement premium protection for $12,500,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $10,000,000. This protects us from having to pay an additional\npremium to reinstate catastrophe coverage for an event up to this level.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Principal Revenue and Expense Items” in Item 7 of\nthis Annual Report and Note 2 and Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nRatings\nMany insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by ratings agencies to assist them in assessing the financial\nstrength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business and from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the\nfinancial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. Financial strength ratings are intended to provide an\nindependent opinion of an insurer’s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors. We currently have a\nDemotech rating of A (Excellent) which qualifies our policies for banks and finance companies. Demotech is the rating agency most commonly used by\ncarriers focused on coastal property risks. The previous ratings from A.M. Best and Kroll Rating Agency for KICO and Kingstone Companies, Inc. were\nwithdrawn at our request.\nCatastrophe Losses\nIn 2023 we had catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued\nby the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25\nmillion in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers. Our predominant market, downstate New York, was affected by\nseveral events during 2023, one of which was a named storm, and one was a major freezing event. The effects of catastrophes during 2023 increased our net\nloss ratio by 7.1 percentage points. We were affected by several events during 2022, including the remnants of Hurricane Ida, as one of the named storms. The\neffects of catastrophes during 2022 increased our net loss ratio by 6.7 percentage points.\n15\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Regulation\nHolding Company Regulation\nWe, as the parent of KICO, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of New York. These laws generally require an insurance\ncompany to register with the New York State Department of Financial Services (the “DFS”) and to furnish annually financial and other information about the\noperations of companies within our holding company system. Generally, under these laws, all material transactions among companies in the holding company\nsystem to which KICO is a party must be fair and reasonable and, if material or of a specified category, require prior notice and approval or acknowledgement\n(absence of disapproval) by the DFS.\nChange of Control\nThe insurance holding company laws of the state of New York require approval by the DFS for any change of control of an insurer. “Control” is\ngenerally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the company, whether\nthrough the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or\nmore of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company; however, the ownership of less than\n10% of such voting securities could constitute control under certain circumstances. Any future transactions that would constitute a change of control of KICO,\nincluding a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the approval of the DFS (and in any\nother state in which KICO may operate). Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may\ndiscourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc., including through transactions,\nand in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.\nState Insurance Regulation\nInsurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser\nextent, other states in which they conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance\nauthorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers, including, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact\nbusiness, set the standards of solvency to be met and maintained, determine the nature of, and limitations on, investments and dividends, approve policy forms\nand rates, and in some instances to regulate unfair trade and claims practices.\nKICO is required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the insurance regulatory authorities in the states in which it is licensed to\ntransact business. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the insurance regulators.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an\ninsurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in\nthe state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the insurance regulatory authority. The state regulator may reject a plan that may lead to market\ndisruption. Laws and regulations, including those in New York, that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval\nrequirements may restrict the ability of KICO to exit unprofitable markets. Such laws did not affect KICO’s ability to withdraw from the commercial liability\nmarket in New York State in 2019 and the commercial auto market in New York State in 2015.\nFederal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes\nFrom time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that either have been\nor are being considered are the possible introduction of Federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers, and\nproposals in various state legislatures. Some of these proposals have been enacted to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model\nacts adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”).\nIn 2017, the DFS implemented new comprehensive cybersecurity regulations, which became effective on March 1, 2017, with transitional\nimplementation periods. On November 1, 2023, the DFS adopted substantive amendments updating the 2017 cybersecurity regulations. The adopted\nregulations require that a covered entity’s chief information security officer (“CISO”) have sufficient authority to ensure that cybersecurity risks are\nappropriately managed and require the CISO to report material cybersecurity issues. Covered entities are further required under the amendments to implement\nasset inventory management, develop and implement a business continuity and disaster recovery plan, and maintain backups protected from unauthorized\nalterations or destruction. The regulations update certain cybersecurity event reporting requirements, including notice and explanation of extortion payments,\nand amends the April 15 annual reporting requirement to include a written acknowledgment of any areas of material noncompliance and remediation plans\nsigned by the entity’s highest-ranking executive and the CISO. Finally, the regulations update the factors the Superintendent may consider in assessing\nviolations.\nThe newly-adopted regulations also apply newly enhanced requirements around periodic system testing, record keeping and maintenance of written\nincident and recovery plans. They further mandate specific technical approaches such as blocking common passwords and the use of multifactor authentication\nin certain instances.\nIn 2010 the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became law. It established a Federal Insurance\nOffice (the “FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO is initially charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than\nhealth insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the\ninsurance regulatory system in the United States. In December 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled “How to\nModernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States”, which stated that, given the “uneven” progress the states have made with\nseveral near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, “Congress should strongly consider\ndirect federal involvement.” The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to\ntake steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers.) In its September 2022 Annual Report on the Insurance Industry (the “Report”), the FIO\nprovided an overview of its statutory responsibilities and its role. The Report then summarized the FIO’s key activities since those described in its prior Annual\nReport on the Insurance Industry. The Report observed that, in 2021, the property/casualty sector direct premium written was $798 billion, a 9% growth over\n2020 levels, the highest annual growth in the past decade. In September 2021, the FIO issued a Preemption Report. This document noted “that during the fiscal\nyear ending September 30, 2021, FIO did not take any action regarding the preemption of any state insurance measures that were inconsistent with a covered\nagreement.” In addition to reviewing the financial status of the property/casualty industry, the Report includes Topical Updates and FIO activities, climate\nchange, mitigation and resilience and Cyber Risks, Ransomware, and Cyber Insurance. The FIO’s September 2023 annual report made similar observations as\nprior years, including noting in the preceding year’s Preemption Report a lack of “any action regarding the preemption of any state insurance measures that\nwere inconsistent with a covered agreement.” The 2023 report further noted that, since the 2022 report, the FIO issued a proposal for the collection of data from\ninsurers to assess climate-related risks across the United States. The request for comment explained that the FIO proposes to collect data from property and\ncasualty insurers regarding current and historical underwriting data on homeowners’ insurance at the zip code level, in order to “assist FIO’s assessment of\nclimate-related exposures and their effects on insurance availability for policyholders, including whether climate change may create the potential for any major\ndisruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.”\n17\nTable of Contents\nOn December 20, 2020, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 was enacted and is now scheduled to expire on December\n31, 2027. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program serves as a federal “backstop” for insurance claims related to acts of terrorism.\nOn November 15, 2021, the DFS issued its final Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers On Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change.\nOn June 15, 2022, the DFS released its 2021 annual report. The report references the creation of a standalone Climate Division, which was the source of the\naforementioned guidance.\nIn 2021, the Governor of the State of New York signed into law, effective January 28, 2022 and subsequently clarified by law taking effect March 15,\n2023, legislation that seeks to prevent homeowner insurers from discriminating solely on the basis of breed of dog.\nIn 2021, the Comprehensive Insurance Disclosure Act was enacted in New York State. This law, as amended by a subsequent chapter amendment,\nrequires any defendant to provide to the plaintiff, within a limited timeframe, proof of existence and the contents of any insurance agreement under which any\nperson or entity may be liable to satisfy part or all of a judgment and details what the information and documentation includes. The new law applies to actions\ncommenced on or after December 31, 2021.\nIn 2022, the New York legislature passed legislation to greatly expand wrongful death actions. This bill sought to expand the categories of claimants\nand scope of losses for which a wrongful death lawsuit could be brought. The bill was vetoed in January 2023. It was again passed in identical form in 2023\nand again vetoed in December 2023.The bill was reintroduced in identical form in February 2024.\nIn 2023, two related bills were chaptered amending the time periods available to an insurer for the investigation and settlement of claims arising out of\nstates of emergency and disasters. This bill codified elements of existing regulations but shortened certain time periods and added additional reporting\nrequirements. Specifically, the law requires that, within fifteen business days after receiving all the items, statements, and forms that the insurer required from\nthe claimant for a non-commercial claim not suspected to be related to arson, the insurer advise the claimant in writing whether the insurer has accepted or\nrejected the claim. An insurer would be allowed two extensions of fifteen additional business days to continue its investigation, provided that the insurer\nnotifies the claimant of the reasons additional time is needed for the investigation, with the second extension being available if the property is inaccessible.\nCommercial claims are granted a one-time thirty-day extension to determine whether the claim should be accepted or rejected, and additional thirty-day\nextensions are available if certain written notifications are made. If the insurer has accepted the claim, the claimant will have to be notified of the amount the\ninsurer is offering to settle the claim and of all applicable policy provisions regarding the claimant's right to reject and appeal the insurer's offer. If the insurer\nrejects the claim, the insurer will have to inform the claimant of all applicable policy provisions regarding the claimant's right to appeal the decision including\npolicy information, insurer contact information and DFS complaint filing procedure information. An insurer will be required to pay the claim not later than four\nbusiness days from the settlement of the claim.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe DFS released a proposed circular letter regarding the use of “external consumer data and information sources (“ECDIS”) and artificial intelligence\nsystems (“AIS”) by insurers. In broad strokes it reiterates the need to make sure that AI processes do not lead to outcomes that run afoul of the extensive body\nof existing anti-discrimination laws, including use of credit as governed by Insurance Law Article 28 credit usage. The circular letter does not have the force of\nlaw, but articulated DFS’ expectations about the use of AIS and ECDIS. In the past, the release of a circular letter has preceded the issuance of draft and\neventually final regulations in the area addressed.\nState Regulatory Examinations\nAs part of their regulatory oversight process, state regulatory authorities conduct periodic detailed examinations of the financial reporting of insurance\ncompanies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance\nregulators of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. The DFS commenced its examination of KICO in 2023 for the years 2019 through 2022.\nThe examination is expected to be completed in 2024.\nRisk-Based Capital Regulations\nState regulatory authorities impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements on insurance enterprises. The RBC Model serves as a benchmark for the\nregulation of insurance companies. RBC provides for targeted surplus levels based on formulas, which specify various weighting factors that are applied to\nfinancial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk, and are set forth in the RBC requirements. Such formulas focus on four\ngeneral types of risk: (a) the risk with respect to the company’s assets (asset or default risk); (b) the risk of default on amounts due from reinsurers,\npolicyholders, or other creditors (credit risk); (c) the risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be\nwritten in the coming year (underwriting risk); and (d) the risk associated with items such as excessive premium growth, contingent liabilities, and other items\nnot reflected on the balance sheet (off-balance sheet risk). The amount determined under such formulas is called the authorized control level RBC (“ACL”).\nThe RBC guidelines define specific capital levels based on a company’s ACL that are determined by the ratio of the company’s total adjusted capital\n(“TAC”) to its ACL. TAC is equal to statutory capital, plus or minus certain other specified adjustments. KICO’s TAC is above the ACL. As of December 31,\n2023, the ratio of TAC to ACL was 4.45 and is in compliance with New York’s RBC requirements.\n19\nTable of Contents\nDividend Limitations\nOur ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to\nsurplus and net investment income. Dividends may be paid, without the need for DFS approval, from unassigned surplus and are restricted to the lesser of 10%\nof surplus or 100% of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends by KICO paid during such period. At\nDecember 31, 2023, unassigned deficit was $7,661,958, and, accordingly, dividends may not be paid without DFS approval. See Item 5 (“Market for\nRegistrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Dividends”) of this Annual Report for a further\ndiscussion as to KICO’s ability to pay dividends to us.\nInsurance Regulatory Information System Ratios\nThe Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed by the NAIC and is intended primarily to assist state insurance regulators in\nmeeting their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies thirteen industry\nratios and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values on four or more of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state\ninsurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business. As of December 31, 2023, KICO had one ratio outside the usual range.\nAccounting Principles\nStatutory accounting principles (“SAP”) are a basis of accounting developed by the NAIC. They are used to prepare the statutory financial statements\nof insurance companies and to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with\nmeasuring an insurer’s policyholder surplus. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates\nin accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are concerned with a company’s solvency, but are also concerned with other financial\nmeasurements, principally results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses\nand accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different types and amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected\nin financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.\nStatutory accounting practices established by the NAIC and adopted in part by New York insurance regulators determine, among other things, the\namount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of KICO and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds that are available for KICO to pay dividends to\nKingstone Companies, Inc.\nLegal Structure\nWe were incorporated in 1961 and assumed the name DCAP Group, Inc. in 1999. On July 1, 2009, we changed our name to Kingstone Companies,\nInc.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 84 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our\nrelationship with our employees is good.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAvailability of Information\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”).

The inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this\nAnnual Report.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nBased upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not\nbe considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThese factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events and other severe weather events, our operating results and\nfinancial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including\nearthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We currently have catastrophe reinsurance coverage\nwith regard to losses of up to $325,000,000 ($315,000,000 in excess of $10,000,000). Effective January 1, 2024, $10,000,000 of losses in a catastrophe are\nsubject to a quota share reinsurance treaty, which covers 5.0% of catastrophe losses such that we retain $9,500,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With\nrespect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to $315,000,000, we are 100% reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is\nlimited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred,\n(ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage\nlimits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and\nfinancial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of\nour financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms\nand conditions of future reinsurance treaties.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail\nand high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of\nclaims when severe weather conditions occur.\n21\nTable of Contents\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the\nconstruction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services\nand supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy\nand by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car\nprices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the\neconomy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to\nenforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim\nseverity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant\nincrease in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nA financial strength rating assigned to our insurance subsidiary was withdrawn at its request; this may impact our revenues and earnings.\nFinancial strength ratings are an important factor influencing the competitive position of insurance companies. The objective of the rating agencies’\nrating systems is to provide an opinion as to an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders. The ratings of\nKingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), our insurance subsidiary, reflect the rating agencies’ opinion as to its financial strength and are not evaluations\ndirected to investors in our securities, nor are they recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities.\nIn July 2023, A.M. Best withdrew the financial strength rating and long-term issuer credit rating of KICO at KICO’s request. Previously, A.M. Best’s\npublic rating for Kingstone Companies, Inc. was withdrawn.\nManagement believes that A.M. Best’s financial strength rating is more significant with regard to commercial liability insurance, as opposed to\npersonal lines business. Since we have discontinued our commercial lines business, we believe that the withdrawal of A.M. Best’s ratings will not result in a\nmaterial decrease in the amount of business that KICO will be able to write. Also, KICO has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional) which\ngenerally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance from highly-rated carriers.\nHowever, a prior A.M Best ratings downgrade resulted in a material decrease in the business of our subsidiary, Cosi, a multi-state licensed general\nagency that had partnered with name-brand carriers which require an A.M. Best “A-” rating from its partners.\nThe impact of pandemics and other public health issues (like COVID-19) and related risks could materially affect our results of operations,\nfinancial position and/or liquidity.\nBeginning in March 2020, the global pandemic related to COVID-19 began to impact the global economy and our results of operations. Risks\npresented by the effects of pandemics like COVID-19 include, among others, the following:\n22\nTable of Contents\nInvestments. Our corporate fixed income portfolio may be adversely impacted by ratings downgrades, increased bankruptcies and credit spread\nwidening in distressed industries. In addition, in recent years, many state and local governments have been operating under deficits or projected deficits. The\nseverity and duration of these deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio. Our investment\nportfolio also includes mortgage-backed securities which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations and/or financial market disruption.\nFurther disruptions in global financial markets could adversely impact our net investment income in future periods.\nAdverse Legislative and/or Regulatory Action. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of pandemic and other\npublic health issues (like COVID-19) may adversely affect us. For example, we may be subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that seeks to retroactively\nmandate coverage for losses which our insurance policies were not designed or priced to cover. Currently, in some states there is proposed legislation to require\ninsurers to cover business interruption claims irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in the policies that would otherwise preclude\ncoverage. Regulatory restrictions or requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and\ninsureds, including our ability to cancel or non-renew policies and our right to collect premiums.\nOperational Disruptions and Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Our operations could be disrupted if key members of our senior management or a\nsignificant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our producers are unable to continue to work because of illness, government directives or\notherwise. In addition, the interruption of our or their system capabilities could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal\nbusiness, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. Having shifted to remote working\narrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications\naccess and capabilities.\nThe failure to comply with certain financial covenants could result in a default with regard to our debt due on December 30, 2024.\nOn December 9, 2022, we entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “Exchanging\nNoteholders”) of our outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders held\n2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2017 Notes then outstanding.\n23\nTable of Contents\nAt the closing of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for, among other things, new 12.0%\nSenior Notes due December 30, 2024 in the aggregate principal amount of $19,950,000 (the “2022 Notes”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we are\nrequired to satisfy certain financial covenants, among other covenants, related to our performance. In the event we do not satisfy such covenants, the holders of\nthe 2022 Notes could declare a default and seek to accelerate the due date for payment, among other remedies. We were not in compliance with one of such\ncovenants as of September 30, 2023; however, we received a waiver from the required holders of the 2022 Notes with regard to such failure to comply. We\nwere in compliance with such covenant as of December 31, 2023.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations, including the 2022 Notes, which may affect our ability to continue as\na going concern.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the 2022 Notes, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject\nto prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a\nsufficient level of cash flows from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If we are unable to\nservice the debt obligation under the 2022 Notes, we may not have the ability to continue as a going concern.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, including with regard to our indebtedness\ndue on December 30, 2024, or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nAs indicated above, our $19,950,000 in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% Senior Notes are due on December 30, 2024. The capital and credit\nmarkets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. In some cases, markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit\ncapacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to support our operating expenses, make payments on our outstanding and any future\nindebtedness, pay for capital expenditures, or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite or to otherwise grow our business, our ability to\nobtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors,\nsuch as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as\nlenders’ perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take\nnegative actions against us. If a combination of these factors occurs, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not\nbe able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and\nliquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic\nconditions, the performance of the economy in general, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment\nportfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from\ngovernmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates\nwould increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds\nreinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower\nrates of return on funds reinvested.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include\nassumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of\noperations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market\nliquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash\nflows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business.\nWe purchase reinsurance to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to protect against possible catastrophes, to remain within a target ratio of net\npremiums written to policyholders’ surplus and to expand our underwriting capacity. Participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve us from our\nobligations to policyholders. Our personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our\nexposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given\nthat reinsurance will remain continuously available to us on terms and rates that are commercially reasonable. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to\nreduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our\ncurrent reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new\nreinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our\nexposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nThe collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions,\nwhether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and\nwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance\ncoverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n25\nTable of Contents\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our stockholders might consider\ndesirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or\nindirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc.\nwould require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company,\nincluding through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our stockholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar\nregulations may apply in other states in which we may operate.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes\nwithin this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory,\nsupervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact\nbusiness and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes,\nprevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk or delay or prevent our entry into new states. In addition, many states have laws\nand regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business\nwritten in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and\nthat subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBecause the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including\nstate insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that\ncompliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's interpretation of\nthe same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's\ninterpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even in the absence\nof any change to a particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions\nwe need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow\nand/or to improve the profitability of our business.\nWhile the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect\nus. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict\nwhether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be\nmade to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business\nand financial condition.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete\nin the property and casualty insurance markets.\nThe DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to\nsupport their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting and off-\nbalance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping\nexisting business. Similar regulations apply in other states in which we operate.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nWe recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather\npatterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive\nunderwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards\nand relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our\noperating results and financial condition.\nBecause substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by\nconditions in such state.\nApproximately 88% of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the State of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing\nregulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it costlier or difficult for us to\nconduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the\ninsurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited\nnumber of brokers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, 35 brokers provided a total of 40% of our total gross premiums written. The nature of our\ndependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of\nthe underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these\nbrokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more\nof these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n27\nTable of Contents\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial\ncondition.\nRecorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances.\nInternal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and\ncontractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic\nconditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for\ncatastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may\nadversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary, KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by\nKICO; our ability to pay the principal of the 2022 Notes on the due date of December 30, 2024 may be limited by these restrictions.\nWe are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations\nof our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to\nrepay debts, pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nState insurance laws limit the ability of KICO to pay dividends from unassigned surplus and require KICO to maintain specified minimum levels of\nstatutory capital and surplus. Maximum allowable dividends by KICO to us are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of net investment income (on\na statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2023, KICO could not pay any\ndividends to us without prior regulatory approval due to negative unassigned surplus of approximately $7,662,000. The aggregate maximum amount of\ndividends permitted by law to be paid by an insurance company does not necessarily define an insurance company’s actual ability to pay dividends. The actual\nability to pay dividends may be further constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, by our competitive\nposition and by the amount of premiums that we can write. State insurance regulators have broad discretion to limit the payment of dividends by insurance\ncompanies. Our ability to pay the principal amount of the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2024 may be limited by these regulatory constraints.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and\nsignificantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers,\nagents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition.\n28\nTable of Contents\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Meryl Golden, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Barry Goldstein, our\nExecutive Chairman. The loss of Ms. Golden or Mr. Goldstein or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain\nadditional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of\nfactors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Ms. Golden and we are\nparties to an employment agreement which expires on December 31, 2024. Mr. Goldstein and we are parties to an employment agreement which expires on the\nearlier of December 31, 2024 or at the time of our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders if he is not re-elected Chairman of the Board at such time.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nGeneral economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As\nconsumers become more cost conscious, they may choose to purchase lower levels of insurance.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our\nreported results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or\nexpanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and\nfinancial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our\nvendors.\nOur business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data.\nSome of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties’ systems. In the course of our\noperations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other\nsensitive business and financial information.\nAll of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to\nunauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may\ninclude attempts to:\n• steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees\n• misappropriate funds\n• disrupt or shut down our systems\n• deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or\n• infect our systems with viruses or malware.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWhile we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once\nthey have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high\ncosts of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee\ninformation is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber\ninsurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-\nattack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems.\nWe rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for stockholders to resell shares of our common\nstock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for stockholders\nto resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading\nvolume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under “Risks Related to Our Business.”\nStock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of\nour common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased\nmarket volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, stockholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our\ncommon stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average\ntrading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if\ndeveloped, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, stockholders have reduced\nliquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThere may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future,\nincluding securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the\nfuture will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing stockholders.\nWe have effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), covering an aggregate of\n1,900,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”).\nAs of December 31, 2023, options to purchase 107,201 shares of our common stock, and 550,581 shares subject to unvested restricted stock grants,\nwere outstanding under the 2014 Plan and 584,596 shares were reserved for issuance thereunder. The shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on\nForm S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by our affiliates. As of December 31, 2023, there were also outstanding warrants\nfor the purchase of 969,525 shares of our common stock. The shares issuable pursuant to an exercise of the warrants may be freely tradeable in the public\nmarket under certain circumstances.\nThe 2014 Plan terminates in August 2024. We plan to submit to our stockholders for approval a new 2024 equity participation plan.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our\ncommon stock, whether directly by us, by selling stockholders in future offerings or by our existing stockholders in the secondary market, the perception that\nsuch issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or\nexchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to\nraise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, and we may issue other\nequity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to repay our\nindebtedness, support operations and growth, maintain our capital ratios, and comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nOur executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the\nvote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs of March 21, 2024, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 1,349,810 shares of our common stock, representing 12.2% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the\nvote on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or\namended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business.\nThe interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other stockholders, and they could take actions that advance their\nown interests to the detriment of our other stockholders.\n31\nTable of Contents\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even\nif the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and\nbylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may\nprevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may\nissue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as\nthe board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other\nfactors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our stockholders.\nWe do not currently pay dividends and are restricted pursuant to our debt agreement from paying dividends.\nWe have not paid cash dividends since September 2022. Our future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will\nbe contingent upon future earnings, if any, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. In addition, pursuant to\nthe Exchange Agreement, we are not permitted to pay any cash dividends without the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount\nof the 2022 Notes. Therefore, we can give no assurance that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity threats; monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities; and test those systems pursuant to\nour cybersecurity policies, processes, and practices, which are integrated into our overall risk management program. To protect our information systems from\ncybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that are designed to help identify, escalate, investigate, resolve, and recover from security incidents in a\ntimely manner.\nKICO’s Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of representatives of its technology team, assesses risks based on probability and potential\nimpact on key business systems and processes. Risks that are considered high are incorporated into its overall risk management program. A mitigation plan is\ndeveloped for each identified high risk, with progress reported to the Risk Management Committee and tracked as part of its overall risk management program\noverseen by the Corporate Sustainability and Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors.\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe collaborate with third parties to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity prevention and response systems and processes. These include\ncybersecurity assessors, consultants, and other external cybersecurity experts to assist in the identification, verification, and validation of cybersecurity risks, as\nwell as to support associated mitigation plans when necessary.\nAdditionally, we require security training for all employees on a quarterly basis. The training covers a wide range of topics, including phishing, social\nengineering and data protection.\nRisk Management\nWe assess and identify security risk to the organization by:\n· conducting assessments of risk, including likelihood and magnitude, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or\ndestruction of information systems and the related information processes, stored or transmitted;\n· performing risk assessments and producing security assessment reports that document the results of the assessment for use and review by\ninformation technology senior leadership, including the Chief Technology Officer;\n· ensuring security controls are assessed for effectiveness, are implemented correctly, operating as intended and producing the desired outcome; and\n· continuously scanning for vulnerabilities and remedying all vulnerabilities in accordance with the associated risk.\nWe have not experienced a material cybersecurity breach in the past five years and, as a result, there have been no charges related to a breach in the\npast five years. Moreover, no risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. While\nwe have implemented processes and procedures that we believe are tailored to address and mitigate the cybersecurity threats that we face, there can be no\nassurances that such an incident will not occur despite our efforts, as more fully described in Item 1A (“Risk Factors – Our business could be adversely affected\nby a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.”) in this Annual Report.\nMonitoring\nWe have established a continuous monitoring strategy and program, which includes:\n· a set of defined security metrics to be monitored;\n· performance of security control assessments on an ongoing basis;\n· addressing results of analysis and reporting security status to the executive team;\n· monitoring information systems to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks;\n· identification of unauthorized use of the information system resources; and\n· deployment of monitoring devices strategically within the information system environment.\nGovernance\nOur Corporate Sustainability and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors has been delegated the power and authority to oversee and\nmake recommendations to the Board with regard to our overall approach to risks relating to business operations, including with regard to information\ntechnology and cybersecurity. In an annual presentation, the committee received a presentation from our Chief Technology Officer regarding our approach to\ncybersecurity, which included the following topics: the confidentiality of nonpublic information and the integrity and security of our information system, the\ncybersecurity policies and procedures, material cybersecurity risks to us, and the overall effectiveness of our Company’s cybersecurity program.\n33\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOur principal executive offices are currently located at 15 Joys Lane, Kingston, New York 12401. Our insurance underwriting business is located\nprincipally at 15 Joys Lane, Kingston, New York 12401. Until March 2024, our insurance underwriting business also maintained an executive office located at\n70 East Sunrise Highway, Valley Stream, New York 11581, at which we leased 4,985 square feet of space. In March 2024, the lease expired and was not\nrenewed.\nWe own the building and the surrounding property at which our insurance underwriting business principally operates, free of mortgage. The property\nconsists of a complex which includes the office building discussed above, a house and vacant land located in Kingston, New York.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF\nEQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “KINS.”\nHolders\nAs of March 21, 2024, there were 229 record holders of our common stock.\nDividends\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available. We paid a\ncash dividend in each quarter from September 2011 through September 2022. On November 11, 2022, our Board of Directors determined to suspend regular\nquarterly dividends in connection with the 2017 Notes refinancing and the need to retain cash to pay a portion of 2017 Notes due on December 30, 2022.\nFuture dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, if any, our financial\ncondition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that future dividends of any kind will be\npaid to holders of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay dividends depends, in part, on the ability of KICO to pay dividends to us. KICO, as an insurance subsidiary, is subject to significant\nregulatory restrictions limiting its ability to declare and pay dividends. In addition, there are restrictions related to surplus and net investment income. Without\nthe prior approval of the DFS, dividends may be paid by insurance carriers from unassigned surplus and are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100%\nof investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2023,\nKICO could not pay any dividends to us without prior regulatory approval due to negative unassigned surplus of approximately $7,662,000. KICO has agreed\nwith the DFS that when KICO satisfies the regulatory requirements that allow for the payment of dividends, KICO must receive approval from the DFS to pay\ndividends. See “Business – Government Regulation”, “Risk Factors – As a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary,\nKICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO; our ability to pay the principal amount of the 2022 Notes on the due date of December 30,\n2024 may be limited by these regulatory constraints” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation –\nLiquidity” in Items 1, 1A and 7, respectively, of this Annual Report.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we are not permitted to pay any cash dividends without the approval of the holders of a majority of\nthe outstanding principal amount of the 2022 Notes. Therefore, we can give no assurance that any dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\n35\nTable of Contents\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nITEM 6. RESERVED.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is a New\nYork domiciled carrier writing business through retail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto\ninsurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest writer of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and Maine. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, 88.3%\nand 80.6% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business\noutside of New York as our “non-Core” business.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies\nit places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, Cosi’s expenses are\nnot included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies are\nwritten for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nNet premiums earned: Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party\nreinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual\nreinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written\nthat are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have\na term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2022, we would earn half of the premiums in 2022 and the other half in 2023.\nCeding commission revenue: Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded to quota share treaties are earned in a manner consistent with the\nrecognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured.\nNet investment income and net gains (losses) on investments: We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and\nequity securities, and other investments. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses.\nNet realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment\nsecurities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than\ntheir costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify our fixed-maturity securities as\neither available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within\naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on our balance sheet while our equity securities and other investments report changes in fair value through\nearnings. See Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our accounting policies following Item 16 of this Annual\nReport.\nOther income: We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred: Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include\nestimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing\nclaims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments\nbased on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our\nhistorical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on\nsuch claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability.\nCommission expenses and other underwriting expenses: Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to\nthe underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the\nproduction of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and\nrecognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance\nbusiness and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy\ncosts, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOther operating expenses: Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc., and\noperating expenses of Cosi. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public\ncompany. Cosi operating expenses primarily include employment costs, occupancy costs and consulting costs.\nStock-based compensation: Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and\namortization of stock options issued to the same.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO,\ndepreciation of the real estate used in KICO’s operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment\nand furniture.\nInterest expense: Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the applicable interest rates. Interest expense also\nincludes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.\nIncome tax expense: We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations as well as state income tax expense for our\nnon-insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and personal\numbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of December 31, 2023, these expired policies represent approximately\n15.8% of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional Financial Information”.\n38\nTable of Contents\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure\nonly the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering its\nbusiness. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net\nunderwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and\nmay not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect\namounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized\ninformation including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of\ncertain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated\nby our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not materialize.\nApplication of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies.\n39\nTable of Contents\nSee below a description of these critical accounting estimates. Also, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements following Item 16 of this\nAnnual Report.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nProperty and Casualty loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves are established to provide for the estimated cost of settling both reported\n(“case”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and claims adjusting expenses. The liability for these reserves is estimated on an undiscounted basis,\nusing individual case-basis valuations and paid claims, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies. Due to the inherent\nuncertainty of the reserve process, actual loss costs could vary significantly compared to estimated loss costs. The below table provides detail of our reserves\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAs of As of\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands) Gross Ceded Net Gross Ceded Net\nCase loss $ 67,108 $ 19,538 $ 47,570 $ 62,745 $ 16,619 $ 46,126\nCase LAE 5,726 1,121 4,605 5,543 898 4,645\nIBNR loss 37,262 10,665 26,597 42,687 10,023 32,664\nIBNR LAE 11,722 1,965 9,757 7,364 120 7,244\nTotal $ 121,818 $ 33,289 $ 88,529 $ 118,340 $ 27,660 $ 90,679\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\nCase Reserves – Reserves for reported losses are based on an estimate of ultimate loss costs of an individual claim derived from individual case-basis\nvaluations, actual claims paid, pending claims, statistical analyses and various actuarial reserving methodologies.\nIBNR Reserves – IBNR reserves are estimates of claims that have occurred but as to which we have not yet been notified to establish the case\nreserve. IBNR is determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance and adjusted to current conditions.\nReinsurance\nWe purchase reinsurance to manage our underwriting risk on certain policies. Reinsurance receivables represent management’s best estimate of loss\nand LAE recoverable from reinsurers. Reinsurance receivables are estimated using the same methodologies as loss and LAE reserves. Changes in the methods\nand assumptions used could result in significant variances between actual and estimated losses.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on GAAP income at statutory tax rates, adjusted for non-taxable and non-deductible items, and tax credits. Changes in\nestimates used in preparing the income statement could result in significant changes to our deferred tax asset or liability.\n40\nTable of Contents\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences which result in differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. These assets and liabilities are carried at the enacted tax rates expected to apply when\nthe asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled. Changes in estimates and assumptions in the income statement, or changes in the enacted tax rate,\ncould result in significant variances between our carried deferred tax and tax recognized on the recovery or settlement of the asset or liability.\nInvestments\nBonds are classified as held-to-maturity (“HTM”) or available-for-sale (“AFS”), and stocks are generally classified as AFS. Investments classified as\nHTM are carried at amortized cost, which requires very little judgement. Investments classified as AFS are generally carried at fair value with an unrealized\ngain/loss recorded in income. Actual results could vary significantly to the fair values recognized in the income statement.\nKingstone 2.0 (completed) and Kingstone 3.0 (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0”, were commenced to modernize our company. The\npillars of the new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthen the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse backgrounds;\n2. Reduce expenses and increase efficiency by embracing technology, including converting to a new policy management system, retiring multiple\nlegacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Develop and implement a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk using advanced analytics\nand an abundance of data; and\n4. Better manage our catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our probable maximum loss (“PML”) in order to\nmitigate the impact of the emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we\ncoined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results, by slowing\nnew business, re-underwriting the book, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory constraints. We\nstopped writing all new non-Core business and have been aggressively reducing policy count. As of December 31, 2023, our non-Core policy\ncount was down by 48% compared to December 31, 2022;\n41\nTable of Contents\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported in each state\nand product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value. Inflation has been a dominant headwind that is showing signs of stabilizing. We\nhave been cognizant that inflation’s impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and, as such, we have been more frequent and\naggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that same inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we\ncompleted our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes were insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums\nattributable to the heightened replacement costs. Overall average written premium for our legacy Core homeowners policies for the last 12 months,\nreflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 24.4%;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML. We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the required limit to be purchased\nwhile maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new business that was deemed to be too expensive and at\nthe same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the greatest risk. The combination of stricter new business underwriting\nand increased non-renewals gave rise to the 5.8% decline in policy count for our Core business. We have now reverted most of our new business\nunderwriting standards back to what they were previously so Core new business growth should increase going forward; and\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net expense ratio to 33% by year-end 2024. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, we achieved our goal, with a net underwriting expense ratio of 32.9%, a reduction of 3.1 points compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nSee the tables below comparing the quarterly trends and changes from our Core and non-Core business for policies in force and direct written\npremiums from September 30, 2022 through December 31, 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, our Core direct written premiums increased\nby 7.0% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, while Core policies in force decreased by 5.8% as of December 31, 2023. For the same\nperiods, our non-Core policies in force decreased by 50.8% and non-Core direct written premiums decreased by 44.5%. We believe that the above actions taken\nwill continue to have the intended effect and will result in a return to annual profitability.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, December 31, March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31,\n2022 2022 2023 2023 2023 2023\n(000’s except percentages and Policies in Force)\nPolicies In Force, as of end of Three Month Period\nCore 71,705 71,359 72,081 70,132 68,498 67,575\nNon-Core 22,007 20,695 18,945 16,224 13,457 10,823\nTotal policies in force 93,712 92,054 91,026 86,356 81,955 78,398\nDirect written premiums\nCore $ 43,949 $ 43,923 $ 41,427 $ 42,211 $ 46,025 $ 47,027\nNon-Core 10,642 9,978 6,170 5,435 5,966 5,911\nTotal direct written premiums $ 54,592 $ 53,901 $ 47,597 $ 47,647 $ 51,992 $ 52,938\nChange from September 30, 2022\nCore\nPolicies In Force\n$ change na $ (346) $ 376 $ (1,573) $ (3,207) $ (4,130)\n% change na -0.5% 0.5% -2.2% -4.5% -5.8%\nDirect written premiums\n$ change na $ (26) $ (2,522) $ (1,738) $ 2,076 $ 3,078\n% change na -0.1% -5.7% -4.0% 4.7% 7.0%\nNon- Core\nPolicies In Force\n$ change na $ (1,312) $ (3,062) $ (5,783) $ (8,550) $ (11,184)\n% change na -6.0% -13.9% -26.3% -38.9% -50.8%\nDirect written premiums\n$ change na $ (664) $ (4,472) $ (5,207) $ (4,676) $ (4,731)\n% change na -6.2% -42.0% -48.9% -43.9% -44.5%\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\n43\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\nYears ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 200,175 $ 201,255 $ (1,080) (0.5) %\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n200,175 201,255 (1,080) (0.5)%\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 51,125 47,409 3,716 7.8%\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 7,122 3,880 3,242 83.6%\nCeded to catastrophe treaties 48,317 42,952 5,365 12.5%\nTotal ceded written premiums 106,564 94,241 12,323 13.1%\nNet written premiums 93,611 107,014 (13,403) (12.5)%\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed 1,871 (9,733) 11,604 na%\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 18,903 17,104 1,799 10.5%\nChange in net unearned premiums 20,774 7,371 13,403 181.8%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 202,046 191,522 10,524 5.5%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (87,661) (77,137) (10,524) (13.6)%\nNet premiums earned 114,384 114,385 (1) -%\nCeding commission revenue (1) 21,053 19,319 1,734 9.0%\nNet investment income 6,009 4,937 1,072 21.7%\nNet gains (losses) on investments 2,135 (9,392) 11,527 na%\nOther income 610 910 (300) (33.0)%\nTotal revenues 144,191 130,159 14,032 10.8%\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 111,997 114,943 (2,946) (2.6)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 11,944 13,106 (1,162) (8.9)%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 123,940 128,048 (4,108) (3.2)%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 37,302 34,185 3,117 9.1%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 3,789 5,474 (1,685) (30.8)%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 41,091 39,658 1,432 3.6%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 74,694 80,758 (6,064) (7.5)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 8,155 7,632 523 6.9%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 82,849 88,390 (5,541) (6.3)%\nCommission expense 33,365 34,582 (1,217) (3.5)%\nOther underwriting expenses 25,910 26,697 (787) (2.9)%\nOther operating expenses 2,456 3,113 (657) (21.1)%\nDepreciation and amortization 2,973 3,300 (327) (9.9)%\nInterest expense 4,003 2,019 1,984 98.3%\nTotal expenses 151,556 158,102 (6,545) (4.1)%\nLoss before taxes (7,365) (27,942) 20,577 73.6%\nIncome tax benefit (1,197) (5,418) 4,221 77.9%\nNet loss $ (6,168) $ (22,525) $ 16,356 72.6%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n(1) Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a 30% personal lines quota share treaty.\n(2) The years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe\nbulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS\ncatastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders\nand insurers.\n44\nTable of Contents\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercentage\nPoint Percent\n2023 2022 Difference Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 72.4% 77.3% (4.9) (6.3)%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 32.9% 36.0% (3.1) (8.6)%\nNet combined ratio 105.3% 113.3% (8.0) (7.1)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2023 (“Year Ended 2023”) were $200,175,000 compared to $201,255,000 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (“Year Ended 2022”). The decrease of $1,080,000, or 0.5%, was primarily due to a decrease in premiums from our personal\nlines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Year Ended 2023 were $185,426,000, a decrease of $2,679,000, or 1.4%, from\n$188,105,000 in Year Ended 2022. The 1.4% decrease in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the decrease in premiums associated\nwith our non-Core business of 39.8% offsetting a 8.6% increase in our Core business. The decrease in our non-Core business premiums and the increase in our\nCore business premiums is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Year Ended 2023 were $14,648,000, an increase of $1,655,000, or 12.7%, from\n$12,993,000 in Year Ended 2022. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an increase\nin the values of the autos insured.\nDirect written premiums from our Core business were $176,692,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $162,255,000 in Year Ended 2022, an increase\nof $14,437,000, or 8.9%. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 5.3% in Year Ended 2023 compared to Year Ended 2022. Beginning in 2017,\nwe commenced our non-Core business and started writing personal lines policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded our non-Core business to Rhode\nIsland, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Direct written premiums from our non-Core business were $23,482,000 in Year Ended 2023 down from $39,000,000 in\nYear Ended 2022, a decrease of $15,518,000, or 39.8%. The decrease in direct written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our decision to\naggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force from our non-Core business decreased by 47.7% in Year Ended 2023 compared to\nYear Ended 2022. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in our non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to\nreduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n45\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums decreased $13,403,000, or 12.5%, to $93,611,000 in Year Ended 2023 from $107,014,000 in Year Ended 2022. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe decrease in Year Ended 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in direct written premiums and an increase in catastrophe premiums rates.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31,\n2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). In Year Ended\n2023, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties increased by $3,716,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Year Ended 2022 (see table above). The\nincrease in Year Ended 2023 was attributable to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty. The remainder of the 2021/2023 Treaty was on a\ncutoff basis and the new 2023/2024 Treaty was placed for 30% on January 1, 2023. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty in Year\nEnded 2023, and the 2021-2023 Treaty in Year Ended 2022.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Year Ended 2023, our ceded excess of loss\n(“XOL”) reinsurance premiums increased by $3,242,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Year Ended 2022. The increase was due to an increase in\nsubject premiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying XOL reinsurance treaty covering the\nperiod from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from\nnamed storms are excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the underlying XOL treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023\nthrough January 1, 2024.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. Catastrophe premiums increased $5,365,000, or 12.5%, to $48,317,000 in Year Ended 2023 from $42,952,000 in Year Ended 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to an increase in catastrophe reinsurance rates. In accordance with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 goals, we have reduced our PML in\nYear Ended 2023, which partially offset the increase in premiums effective July 1, 2023.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned remained flat at $114,384,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $114,385,000 in Year Ended 2022.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nYears ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 20,397 $ 19,106 $ 1,291 6.8%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 656 214 442 206.5%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 21,053 $ 19,319 $ 1,734 9.0%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nCeding commission revenue was $21,053,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $19,319,000 in Year Ended 2022. The increase of $1,734,000 was due\nto an increase in both provisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of provisional ceding\ncommissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Year Ended 2023, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $20,397,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty, and in Year Ended 2022, we earned provisional ceding commissions of $19,106,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023\nTreaty. The increase of $1,291,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the increase in premiums ceded under these treaties during Year\nEnded 2023 compared to Year Ended 2022.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2023/2024 Treaty and the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received. The increase in Year Ended\n2023 was primarily attributable to a one time true up from a prior year treaty.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $6,009,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $4,937,000 in Year Ended 2022, an increase of $1,072,000, or 21.7%. The\nincrease in investment income was attributable to a $766,000 reversal in Year Ended 2022 of prior years’ estimated accrued interest income stemming from an\nerror in third party investment reporting. The increase was also due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances. The average yield on non-cash invested\nassets was 3.75% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 3.42% as of December 31, 2022.\n47\nTable of Contents\nCash and invested assets were $183,610,000 as of December 31, 2023 compared to $191,046,000 as of December 31, 2022. The $7,436,000 decrease\nin cash and invested assets was primarily attributable to the cash used to fund disbursements of claims resulting from higher severity losses and inflation’s\nimpact on losses, along with catastrophe losses incurred in Year Ended 2023 and prior periods. The increase in disbursement of losses was partially offset by an\nincrease in unrealized gains on our investment portfolio.\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $2,135,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to net (losses) of $(9,392,000) in Year Ended 2022. Unrealized gains on our\nequity securities and other investments in Year Ended 2023 were $2,153,000, compared to unrealized (losses) of $(9,252,000) in Year Ended 2022. Net realized\n(losses) on sales of investments were $(19,000) in Year Ended 2023 compared to net realized (losses) of $(140,000) in Year Ended 2022.\nOther Income\nOther income was $610,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $910,000 in Year Ended 2022, a decrease of $300,000, or 33.0%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $82,849,000 for Year Ended 2023 compared to $88,390,000 for Year Ended 2022. The net loss ratio was 72.4% in Year Ended\n2023 compared to 77.3% in Year Ended 2022, a decrease of 4.9 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n48\nTable of Contents\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nFor Year Ended 2023, the 4.9 point reduction in the loss ratio compared to Year Ended 2022 was mainly due to a lower underlying loss ratio (loss ratio\nexcluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) and reduced impact from prior year development.\nThe estimated net catastrophe losses were $8,155,000 for Year Ended 2023, which contributed 7.1 points to the loss ratio. There were two winter storm\nevents including a major freezing event at the beginning of February, ten wind and thunderstorm events, and one tropical storm classified as catastrophe for\nYear Ended 2023. By comparison, catastrophe events had a loss ratio impact of 6.7 points for Year Ended 2022.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 65.3% for Year Ended 2023, a decrease of 2.9 points from the 68.2% underlying loss ratio recorded for Year Ended 2022.\nThe loss experience in Year Ended 2023 was improved due to lower frequency but was offset by increasing severity resulting from inflation and an elevated\nnumber of large losses.\nPrior year development was stable for Year Ended 2023. There was an overall favorable development of $7,000, which had minimal impact on the loss\nratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $33,365,000 in Year Ended 2023 or 16.5% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $34,582,000 in Year Ended\n2022 or 18.1% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $1,217,000 was primarily due to a reduction of commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with our Kingstone 3.0 strategy as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products, but offset in part by\nan increase in direct earned premiums of $10,524,000 to $202,046,000.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $25,910,000, or 12.8% of direct earned premiums, in Year Ended 2023 compared to $26,697,000, or 13.9% of direct\nearned premiums, in Year Ended 2022. The decrease of $787,000, or 2.9%, was primarily due to decreases in professional fees, credit card fees and policy\nmanagement system fees as result of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems. The\ndecreases were partially offset by a net increase in salaries and employment costs as described below, an increase in insurance department fees, and the impact\nfrom high inflation.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $11,335,000 in Year Ended 2023\ncompared to $10,799,000 in Year Ended 2022. The increase of $536,000, or 5.0%, is compared unfavorably to the 0.5% decrease in direct written premiums. In\nthe periods following Year Ended 2022, we continued to strengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated\nmanagers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies. The increase in salaries was partially offset\nby a reduction in our staff in June and July 2023 as we have been reducing our non-Core business.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Year Ended 2023 was 32.9% compared to 36.0% in Year Ended 2022.

The following table shows a breakdown of the significant components of other operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nOther operating expenses\nEmployement costs $ 376 $ (24) $ 400 na%\nEquity compensation 833 1,393 (560) (40.2)\nProfessional 276 765 (489) (63.9)\nDirectors fees 275 327 (52) (15.9)\nInsurance 194 154 40 26.0\nOther expenses 502 498 4 0.8\nTotal other operating expenses $ 2,456 $ 3,113 $ (657) (21.1)%\n(Components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nThe decrease in Year Ended 2023 of $657,000, or 21.1%, as compared to Year Ended 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation and\nprofessional fees, partially offset by an increase in employment costs. The increase in employment costs was due to the hiring of our new Chief Financial\nOfficer in Year Ended 2023 and fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio. The decrease in\nprofessional fees is due to $354,000 incurred in Year Ended 2022 related to a then contemplated transaction that would have resulted in a third party acquiring\nall of the outstanding equity of our company.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $2,973,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $3,300,000 in Year Ended 2022. The decrease of $327,000, or 9.9%,\nin depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Year Ended 2023 was $4,003,000 compared to $2,019,000 in Year Ended 2022, an increase of $1,984,000 or 98.3%. In Year Ended\n2023, as disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we incurred increased interest expense in connection with the 2022 Notes, which provide\nfor interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing. In Year 2022, we incurred interest expense in connection with the 2017 Notes, our\n$30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017, which provided for interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum, and the equipment financing incurred in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022.\n52\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit in Year Ended 2023 was $1,197,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 16.3%. Income tax benefit in Year Ended\n2022 was $5,418,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.4%. Loss before taxes was $7,365,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $27,942,000 in Year\nEnded 2022. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Year Ended 2023 compared to Year Ended 2022.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $6,168,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $22,525,000 in Year Ended 2022. The significant decrease in net loss of $16,356,000, or\n72.6%, was primarily attributable to net gains on investments of $2,135,000 in Year Ended 2023 versus net losses on investments of $9,392,000 in Year Ended\n2022 and a decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses of $5,541,000.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance.

The\nprevious method used in 2022 was weighted average life (“WAL”) converted to effective maturity. The new method used in 2023 is final cash flow date prior\nto maturity. The new methodology aims to more accurately reflect the effective maturity of prepaying securities by considering the final cash flow date instead\nof relying solely on the WAL conversion\nFair Value Consideration\nAs disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, with respect to “Fair Value Measurements,” we define fair value as the price that would\nbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities between market participants (an\n“exit price”). The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources (“observable inputs”) and a reporting\nentity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair\nvalue hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have\nthe highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level\n2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level\n3”). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 65% of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\n63\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the\nsecurity has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\nand obligations of U.S.\ngovernment corporations\nand agencies $5,974,440 $ (17,373) 1 $ - $ - - $ 5,974,440 $ (17,373)\nPolitical subdivisions of\nStates, Territories and\nPossessions - - - 13,398,552 (3,209,161) 13 13,398,552 (3,209,161)\nCorporate and other\nbonds industrial and\nmiscellaneous - - - 70,107,746 (5,885,296) 85 70,107,746 (5,885,296)\nResidential mortgage and\nother asset backed securities 88,988 (2,144) 4 38,675,604 (6,541,731) 37 38,764,592 (6,543,875)\nTotal fixed-maturity\nsecurities $6,063,428 $ (19,517) 5 $122,181,902 $(15,636,188) 135 $128,245,330 $(15,655,705)\n64\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities\nand obligations of U.S.\ngovernment corporations\nand agencies $18,918,196 $ (6,928) 3 $ - $ - - $ 18,918,196 $ (6,928)\nPolitical subdivisions of\nStates, Territories and\nPossessions 7,970,633 (2,195,273) 9 5,170,753 (1,771,494) 5 13,141,386 (3,966,767)\nCorporate and other\nbonds industrial and\nmiscellaneous 56,910,104 (5,796,994) 75 15,172,381 (2,458,985) 15 72,082,485 (8,255,979)\nResidential mortgage and\nother asset backed securities 10,145,880 (882,664) 22 34,753,178 (7,150,803) 26 44,899,058 (8,033,467)\nTotal fixed-maturity\nsecurities $93,944,813 $(8,881,859) 109 $55,096,312 $(11,381,282) 46 $149,041,125 $(20,263,141)\n65\nTable of Contents\nThere were 140 securities at December 31, 2023 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of\nwhich were deemed to be credit losses by us. There were 155 securities at December 31, 2022 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity\nsecurities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed to be credit losses by us. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were\ntemporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and\ninterest rate environment factors, management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these\ninvestments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends and distributions received from KICO, which are subject to statutory\nrestrictions. For the year ended December 31, 2023, KICO paid a dividend of $1,250,000 to us. As of December 31, 2023, KICO had a negative unassigned\nsurplus and currently will not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. In September 2023, KICO received regulatory approval\nand paid us a $2,700,000 distribution from paid in capital. In December 2023, KICO received regulatory approval to pay us an additional $2,300,000\ndistribution from paid in capital. KICO intends to pay us the $2,300,000 distribution in 2024.\nKICO is a member of the FHLBNY, which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments to our consolidated\nfinancial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net\nadmitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is September 30, 2023. On July 6, 2023, A.M. Best withdrew KICO’s ratings as KICO requested to\nno longer participate in A.M. Best’s interactive rating process. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO is currently only able to borrow on an\novernight basis. The maximum allowable advance as of December 31, 2023, based on the net admitted assets as of September 30, 2023, was approximately\n$12,813,000. Available collateral as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $11,412,000. As a result of the withdrawal of A.M. Best ratings, KICO is\ncurrently only able to borrow on an overnight basis. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this\nfacility during Year Ended 2023.\n66\nTable of Contents\nOn December 15, 2022, we issued $19,950,000 of our 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. The Exchange Agreement provided for a\nmandatory redemption payment with regard to the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023 in an amount discussed in Note 9 – Debt of the consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Annual Report. The mandatory redemption payment was based on the maximum Ordinary Dividend Paying Capacity of KICO as\ndiscussed in Note 9, which was a negative amount and, accordingly, the Company was not required to make a mandatory redemption of the 2022 Notes on\nDecember 30, 2023.We are also required to make semi-annual interest payments in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year. The maturity date of the\n2022 Notes is December 30, 2024.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company debt service and other cash requirements,\nwe will seek to obtain additional financing. See Notes 2 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of our\nplans in this regard.\nOur reconciliation of net loss to net cash used by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing\nof reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nYears ended December 31, 2023 2022\nCash flows (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (11,326,850) $ (915,521)\nInvesting activities 9,461,700 (5,905,779)\nFinancing activities (1,116,080) (5,511,070)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (2,981,230) (12,332,370)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 11,958,228 24,290,598\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 8,976,998 $ 11,958,228\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11,327,000 in Year Ended 2023 as compared to $916,000 used in operating activities in Year Ended 2022.\nThe $10,411,000 increase in cash flows used in operating activities in Year Ended 2023 as compared to Year Ended 2022 was primarily the result of an increase\nin cash used arising from net fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of\n$5,029,000. The increase in cash used in operating activities is also partially offset by the payment of $13,245,000 to reinsurers in Year Ended 2022 pursuant to\nthe inception of our quota share reinsurance treaty, effective December 31, 2021. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities\nof KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations, payments on claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $9,462,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $5,906,000 used in investing activities in Year Ended 2022\nresulting in a $15,368,000 increase in net cash provided by investing activities. In Year Ended 2023, we had net cash provided by our investment portfolio of\n$11,289,000, compared to $1,355,000 used in Year Ended 2022. In addition, we decreased our acquisition of fixed assets by $2,724,000 in Year Ended 2023\ncompared to Year Ended 2022.\n67\nTable of Contents\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,116,000 in Year Ended 2023 compared to $5,511,000 used in Year Ended 2022. The $4,395,000 decrease\nin net cash used in financing activities was attributable to a $10,050,000 principal payment on the 2017 Notes in 2022 and $1,758,000 of bond issue costs, both\npaid in connection with the Exchange Agreement with no similar payments in 2023. In addition, no dividends were paid to shareholders in Year Ended 2023\ncompared to $1,277,000 being paid in Year Ended 2022 and a $378,000 decrease in withholding taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock awards. The\ndecreases in cash used in financing activities were partially offset by $8,097,000 of proceeds in Year Ended 2022 from equipment financing in connection with\nKICO’s sale-leaseback transaction and the related $897,000 increase in debt repayments in Year Ended 2023.\nReinsurance\nThe following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10% of our reinsurance recoverables on\npaid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2023:\nAmount\nRecoverable\nA.M. as of\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) Best Rating 2023 %\nSwiss Reinsurance America Corporation A+ $ 17,587 36.1%\nHanover Rueck SE A+ 8,661 17.8%\nAllied World Insurance Company (1) A 6,914 14.2%\nAce Property and Casualty Insurance Company A++ 5,045 10.4%\n38,207 78.5%\nOthers (2) 10,459 21.5%\nTotal $ 48,666 100.0%\n(1) Represents $4,000 guaranteed by irrevocable letters of credit.\n(2) Of the $5,673,000 reinsurance recoverables included in Others at December 31, 2023, $2,236,000 was secured pursuant to a collateralized trust\nagreement and $426,000 guaranteed by irrevocable letters of credit.

Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to\nbe higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\n70\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended 2023 included continuing economic inflation, which resulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower\npublic equity valuations, and significant financial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads previously reduced the value of our\nfixed income securities, saw a reversal which had previously lowered our stockholders’ equity materially in prior quarters. For Year Ended 2023, the continuing\neconomic inflation impacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively\nimpact our results of operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return. This action\nhas led, and may continue to lead, to a slowdown in premium growth, particularly in new business.\nITEM 7A.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded\nthat our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,\nand effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nITEM 9B.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly,\nin all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of\nthe two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nEvaluation of the Estimate of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense (“LAE”) Reserves\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements, the loss and LAE reserves represent the Company’s estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid\nlosses. These reserves are based on facts and circumstances then known and include provisions for claims that have been reported and claims that have been\nincurred but not reported (“IBNR”). The projection of future claim payments and reporting is based on analyses of the Company’s historical experience,\nsupplemented by analyses of industry loss data. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s loss and LAE reserves balance was approximately $121.8 million.\nThe principal considerations that led us to conclude the estimate of loss and LAE reserves was a critical audit matter include the significance of the reserves to\nthe Company’s financial statements, the inherent judgment necessary to estimate the reserves, and the degree of variability involved in determining the\nestimate. Therefore, we determined that the liability for loss and LAE reserves was a critical audit matter, which required significant auditor judgment and\nspecialized skill and knowledge including the involvement of actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address the Company’s loss and LAE reserves included, but were not limited to, testing the Company’s reserving\nprocess, including the actuarial analyses and the determination of the Company’s estimate of the loss and LAE reserves as follows:\n· Utilizing consulting actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to analyze the appropriateness of the methodologies utilized by\nthe Company to estimate reserves and to determine the reasonableness of the gross and net loss and LAE reserves recorded by the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n· Having consulting actuarial professionals also analyze the approach, methodology, assumptions, and ultimate losses and LAE documented in the\nactuarial reports prepared by the independent actuarial firm engaged by the Company.\n· Analyzing the consistency of the Company’s recorded reserves relative to the actuarial central estimates of the reserve range determined by the\nCompany’s independent actuarial firm at December 31, 2023 in comparison to December 31, 2022.\n· Performing hindsight analysis to determine the completeness and accuracy of reserves recorded in the prior year and performing analytical\nprocedures on current year reserves.\n· Analyzing the 2023 quarterly actuarial reports prepared by the Company’s Chief Actuary.\n· Testing the claims handling process, including the establishment of individual case reserves and the settlement of claims.\n· Verifying the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data, including historical claims data, provided to the independent actuarial firm\nengaged by the Company for the purpose of preparing the actuarial analysis at December 31, 2023.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nMarcum LLP\nHartford, CT\nApril 1, 2024\nPCAOB ID Number 688\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

(referred to herein as \"Kingstone\" or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is a New York domiciled carrier writing business through\nretail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is actively writing personal lines and commercial auto insurance in New York, and in 2023 was the 15th largest\nwriter of homeowners insurance in New York. KICO is also licensed in the states of New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania,\nNew Hampshire, and Maine. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, 88.3% and 80.6%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from\nthe New York policies. Kingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission\nrevenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP assuming that the Company will continue as a going\nconcern for a period of one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company’s $30,000,000 5.5% Senior Unsecured Notes (the “2017\nNotes”) were due on December 30, 2022. The Company’s continuation as a going concern was dependent on its ability to obtain financing and/or other funds\nto satisfy such obligation. The 2017 Notes were refinanced on December 15, 2022 under a note and warrant exchange agreement with a refinanced balance of\n$19,950,000 (the “2022 Notes”) as of December 31, 2022 and a maturity date of December 30, 2024 (see Note 9 - Debt).\nThe Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy the maturity obligation of the 2022\nNotes on December 31, 2024. Management believes that KICO’s insurance operations would be able to continue in the unlikely event that financing is not\nobtained.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), the Company\nhas the responsibility to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about its ability to meet its future financial obligations as they\nbecome due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation requires management to perform two steps. First,\nmanagement must evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nSecond, if management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is required to consider whether it has plans in place to alleviate that doubt.\nDisclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are required if management concludes that substantial doubt exists or that its plans alleviate the\nsubstantial doubt that was raised.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“GAAP”) assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the\npossible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be\nunable to continue as a going concern.\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nManagement’s Plan Related to Going Concern\nIn order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need to obtain financing and/or other funds to satisfy its debt obligation on December 30, 2024.\nManagement plans to refinance the 2022 Notes with a new issue of equity securities and/or investment grade debt securities of similar or longer maturity that\nwould result in net proceeds equal to or greater than the principal amount of the 2022 Notes. In connection therewith, the Company will be utilizing\ninvestment bankers to serve as placement agents for proposed offerings by the Company of its securities (including debt, equity and/or preferred\nsecurities). The offerings would be of such size as to generate proceeds to the Company of no less than $19,950,000. The Company, subject to regulatory\napproval, may receive distributions paid to it by KICO, its insurance subsidiary, that could be utilized to repay the 2022 Notes. Further, the Company may also\nuse available invested assets and cash to repay the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 2023, invested assets and cash was approximately $2,042,000.\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described above. The Company\nbelieves that its plan is probable of being implemented and that such plan would alleviate any adverse conditions.\nReclassification of Balances from Prior Year Disclosure\nComponents of ceded premiums written within prior year net earned premiums in Note 11 were reclassified to conform with an elected change in the current\nyear presentation by recording ceded written premiums for the 12 months of the contract term at inception, rather than monthly over the contract term,\nproviding a full disclosure of the premiums ceded. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CMIC\nProperties, Inc. and 15 Joys Lane, LLC, which together own the land and building from which KICO operates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company\naccount balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet Premiums Earned\nInsurance policies issued by the Company are short-duration contracts. Accordingly, premium revenues, net of premiums ceded to reinsurers, are recognized as\nearned in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided, on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the underlying policies. Unearned premiums\nrepresent premiums applicable to the unexpired portions of in-force insurance contracts at the end of each year.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nCeding Commission Revenue\nCommissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the costs of the reinsurance, generally on a pro-rata\nbasis over the terms of the policies reinsured. Unearned amounts are recorded as deferred ceding commission revenue. Certain reinsurance agreements contain\nprovisions whereby the ceding commission rates vary based on the loss experience under the agreements. The Company records ceding commission revenue\nbased on its current estimate of subject losses. The Company records adjustments to ceding commission revenue in the period that changes in the estimated\nlosses are determined.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expenses (“LAE”) Reserves\nThe liability for loss and LAE represents management’s best estimate of the ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses that are unpaid as of the balance\nsheet date. The liability for loss and LAE is estimated on an undiscounted basis, using individual case-basis valuations, statistical analyses and various actuarial\nreserving methodologies. The projection of future claim payment and reporting is based on an analysis of the Company’s historical experience, supplemented\nby analyses of industry loss data. Management believes that the reserves for loss and LAE are adequate to cover the ultimate cost of losses and claims to date;\nhowever, because of the uncertainty from various sources, including changes in reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation,\nand economic conditions, actual loss experience may not conform to the assumptions used in determining the estimated amounts for such liability at the\nbalance sheet date. Adjustments to these estimates are reflected in expense for the period in which the estimates are changed. Because of the nature of the\nbusiness historically written, management believes that the Company has limited exposure to environmental claim liabilities.\nReinsurance\nIn the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from catastrophes or other events that cause unfavorable underwriting\nresults. This is done by reinsuring certain levels of risk in various areas of exposure with a panel of financially secure reinsurance carriers.\nReinsurance receivables represents management’s best estimate of paid and unpaid loss and LAE recoverable from reinsurers, and ceded losses receivable and\nunearned ceded premiums under reinsurance agreements. Ceded losses receivable are estimated using techniques and assumptions consistent with those used in\nestimating the liability for loss and LAE. Management believes that reinsurance receivables as recorded represent its best estimate of such amounts; however,\nas changes in the estimated ultimate liability for loss and LAE are determined, the estimated ultimate amount receivable from the reinsurers will also change.\nAccordingly, the ultimate receivable could be significantly in excess of or less than the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Adjustments\nto these estimates are reflected in the period in which the estimates are changed. Loss and LAE incurred as presented in the consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss) are net of reinsurance recoveries.\nManagement has evaluated its reinsurance arrangements and determined that significant insurance risk is transferred to the reinsurers. Reinsurance agreements\nhave been determined to be short-duration prospective contracts and, accordingly, the costs of the reinsurance are recognized over the life of the contract in a\nmanner consistent with the earning of premiums on the underlying policies subject to the reinsurance contract.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nManagement estimates uncollectible amounts receivable from reinsurers based on an assessment of factors including the creditworthiness of the reinsurers and\nthe adequacy of collateral obtained, where applicable. There was no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company\ndid not expense any uncollectible reinsurance for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Significant uncertainties are inherent in the assessment of the\ncreditworthiness of reinsurers and estimates of any uncollectible amounts due from reinsurers. Any change in the ability of the Company’s reinsurers to meet\ntheir contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements as well as KICO’s ability to meet its regulatory\ncapital and surplus requirements.\nThe Company presents its net reinsurance receivables separately from its reinsurance balances payable in accordance with ASU 2011-11 Balance Sheet (Topic\n210). Additionally, prepaid premiums for excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties are presented net in reinsurance balances payable as a reduction to\nreinsurance premiums payable as they meet the net accounting criteria of Topic 210.\nCredit Losses\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (ASU 2016-13) added an asset impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The purpose of\nthis ASU was to reduce complexity by decreasing the number of impairment models that entities use to account for debt instruments, allows for more timely\nrecognition of credit losses by using an expected, rather than incurred loss, model, requires recognition of lifetime expected credit losses, and doesn’t require a\nspecific method for estimating expected credit losses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash\nbalances at several financial institutions.\nInvestments\nThe Company classifies its fixed-maturity securities as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Fixed-maturity securities that the Company has the\nspecific intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as such and carried at amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated\nfair values based on quoted market prices from recognized pricing services, adjusted for allowance for expected credit losses, with unrealized gains and losses,\nnet of tax effects, reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses are determined on the specific\nidentification method and reported in net loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nEquity securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on quoted market prices from recognized pricing services, adjusted for allowance for expected\ncredit losses, with unrealized gains and losses reported in net gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive\nincome (loss). Other investments are reported at their estimated fair values using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share (or its equivalent) of the instrument\nwith unrealized gains and losses reported in net gains (losses) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nSee Note - 3, Investments for additional discussion.\nThe Company reviews all securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis to assess whether the decline in the securities’ fair value necessitates the\nrecognition of an allowance for credit losses. Factors considered in the review include the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost,\ncurrent market interest rates and whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company also considers factors\nspecific to the issuer including the general financial condition of the issuer, the issuers’ industry and future business prospects, any past failure of the issuer to\nmake scheduled interest or principal payments, the payment structure of the investment and the issuers’ ability to make contractual payments on the investment.\nThe Company may sell its available-for-sale securities, equity securities, and other investments in response to changes in interest rates, risk/reward\ncharacteristics, liquidity needs or other factors. Investment income is accrued to the balance sheet dates of the consolidated financial statements and includes\namortization of premium and accretion of discount on fixed-maturity securities. Interest is recognized when earned, while dividends are recognized when\ndeclared. Due and accrued investment income totaled approximately $1,262,000 and $1,299,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is\nincluded in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFor fixed-maturity securities where a decline in fair value is below the amortized cost basis and the Company intends to sell the security, or it is more likely\nthan not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, a credit-loss charge is recognized in net loss based on the\nfair value of the security at the time of assessment.\nFor available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, a credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost\nbasis. The allowance for credit loss related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to\nbe collected and the amortized cost basis, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company considers all available\nevidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded, which is recognized in net loss through an\nallowance for credit losses. Any remaining decline in fair value represents the noncredit portion of the impairment, which is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nThe Company did not identify any available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2023 which presented a risk of loss due to credit deterioration of the\nsecurity.\nPremiums Receivable\nPremiums receivable include balances due currently or in the future and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $269,000 and\n$39,000 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible amounts is based on an analysis of amounts receivable giving\nconsideration to historical loss experience and current economic conditions and reflects an amount that, in management’s judgment, is adequate. Uncollectible\npremiums receivable balances of approximately $75,000 and $133,000 were written off for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates cancellations after the balance sheet date and has determined that the cancellations are not material, therefore no additional cancellation\nreserve is recognized as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs represent the costs of writing business that vary with, and are primarily related to, the successful production of insurance business\n(principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related\npremiums are earned.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company has recorded acquired identifiable intangible assets. The cost of a group of assets acquired in a transaction is allocated to the individual assets\nincluding identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values. Identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized over the period that the\nasset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company. Intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized, but are\nsubject to impairment testing if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the asset is impaired. All identifiable intangible assets\nare tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment losses from\nintangible assets were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nProperty and Equipment\nBuilding and building improvements, automobiles, furniture, computer equipment, and computer software are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company estimates the useful life for computer\nequipment, automobiles, furniture and other equipment is three years, computer software is three to five years, and building and building improvements is 39\nyears.\nThe Company reviews its real estate assets used as its headquarters to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for market changes due to declines\nin the estimated fair value of the property. In evaluating potential impairment, management considers the current estimated fair value compared to the carrying\nvalue of the asset. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of the real estate assets is estimated to be in excess of the carrying value.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\nassets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using\nenacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income (loss) in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company files a\nconsolidated tax return with its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to\nliabilities or operations were required.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nConcentration, Credit Risk and Market Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, investments, and premium\nand reinsurance receivables. At times, cash may be uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance\nlimits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk.\nStressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in capital markets or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on the Company, in part because the\nCompany has a large investment portfolio supporting the Company’s insurance liabilities, which are sensitive to changing market factors. These market factors,\nwhich include interest rates, credit spread, equity prices, and the volatility and strength of the capital markets, all affect the business and economic environment\nand, ultimately, the profitability of the Company’s business. The Company manages its investments to limit credit and other market risks by diversifying its\nportfolio among various security types and industry sectors based on KICO’s investment committee guidelines, which employ a variety of investment\nstrategies.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s cash equivalents were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCollateralized bank repurchase agreement (1) $ 899,646 $ 159,596\nMoney market funds 2,430,317 2,458,223\nTotal $ 3,329,963 $ 2,617,819\n(1) The Company has a security interest in certain of the bank's holdings of direct obligations of the United States or one or more agencies thereof.\nThe collateral is held in a hold-in-custody arrangement with a third party who maintains physical possession of the collateral on behalf of the bank.\nAt December 31, 2023, the outstanding premiums receivable balance is generally diversified due to the large number of individual insureds comprising the\nCompany’s customer base.\nThe Company also has receivables from its reinsurers. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company of its obligations to policyholders. Failure of\nreinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company periodically evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers to\nminimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. See Note 7- Reinsurance for reinsurance recoverables on unpaid and paid losses by\nreinsurer. Management’s policy is to review all outstanding receivables quarterly as well as the bad debt write-offs experienced in the past and establish an\nallowance for doubtful accounts, if deemed necessary.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nDirect premiums earned from lines of business in excess of 10% of the total subject the Company to concentration risk for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022 is as follows:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nPersonal Lines 93.1% 94.0%\nPremiums earned not subject to concentration 6.9% 6.0%\nTotal premiums earned 100.0% 100.0%\n(1) For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, premiums earned not subject to concentration are comprised primarily of one line of business.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and includes the reserves for losses and LAE,\nwhich are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of\nmany years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with receivables under reinsurance contracts related to contingent ceding commission revenue\nrequire judgments by management. On an ongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating these estimates. Actual\nresults may differ significantly from the estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nEarnings (Loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflects, in periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable\nupon the exercise of stock options and warrants as well as non-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes\nthose options and warrants with an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Company’s common shares during the periods presented.\nAdditionally, the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes unvested restricted stock awards as calculated using the treasury stock method.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to operations as incurred. Advertising costs are included in other underwriting expenses in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and were approximately $86,000 and $114,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense in 2023 and 2022 is the estimated fair value of restricted stock awards and options granted, amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period for the entire portion of the award less an estimate for anticipated forfeitures. The Company uses the “simplified” method\nto estimate the expected term of the options because the Company’s historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which\nto estimate expected term.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nWarrants\nThe Company’s outstanding issued warrants are accounted for as equity in accordance with ASC 480-10, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with\nCharacteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. The Company’s warrants are accounted for at fair value on the issuance date with no changes in fair value\nrecognized after the issuance date.\nCompensated Absences\nEmployees of the Company are entitled to paid vacations, sick days, and other time off depending on job classification, length of service and other factors. The\nCompany has determined it is impracticable to estimate the amount of compensation of future absences and, accordingly, no liability has been recorded in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company’s policy is to recognize the cost of compensated absences when paid to employees.\nLeases\nThe Company records operating leases in accordance with ASU 2016-02 – Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”). Under ASU 2016-02, the Company\nrecognized a right-of-use-asset and corresponding liability on the balance sheet for all leases, except for leases covering a period of fewer than 12 months. The\nliability has been measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments taking into account renewal options if applicable plus initial incremental\ndirect costs such as commissions. The minimum payments are discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The right-of-use asset is amortized\nas rent expense on a straight-line basis.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive income (loss) but are excluded from net income\n(loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders' equity, primarily from changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-\nsale securities, net of the related income taxes.\nAccounting Changes\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement\nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This guidance applies to reinsurance and insurance receivables and other financing receivables.\nFor available-for-sale fixed maturity securities carried at fair value, estimated credit losses will continue to be measured at the present value of expected cash\nflows; however, the other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) concept has been eliminated. Under the previous guidance, estimated credit impairments\nresulted in a write-down of amortized cost. Under the new guidance, estimated credit losses are recognized through an allowance and reversals of the\nallowance are permitted if the estimate of credit losses declines. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where the Company has an intent to sell,\nimpairment will continue to result in a write-down of amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The Company\ndetermined as of the date of adoption that the updated guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Below is a summary of the\nsignificant accounting policies impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is reported as a reduction of a financial asset’s cost basis and is measured on a pool basis when\nsimilar risk characteristics exist. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Historical\ncredit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and adjustments may be made to reflect current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for any additional factors that come to the Company’s attention. This could\ninclude significant shifts in counterparty financial strength ratings, aging of past due receivables, amounts sent to collection agencies, or other underlying\nportfolio changes. Amounts are considered past due when payments have not been received according to contractual terms. The Company also considers\ncurrent and forecasted economic conditions, using a variety of economic metrics and forecast indices. The sensitivity of expected credit losses relative to\nchanges to these forecasted economic conditions can vary by financial asset class. The Company considers a reasonable and supportable forecast period to be\nup to 24 months from the balance sheet date. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical credit experience. The Company uses collateral\narrangements such as letters of credit and amounts held in beneficiary trusts to mitigate credit risk, which are considered in the estimate of net amount expected\nto be collected.\nThe Company has determined that it was not subject to any other new accounting pronouncements that became effective during the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires disaggregated information\nabout a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by\nproviding more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. ASU-2023-09 is effective for public companies\nwith annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The valuation technique used by the Company to estimate the fair value of its financial instruments is the market approach, which uses\nprices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the assets or liabilities fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the classification is based on the\nlowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. Classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy considers\nthe markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded, including during periods of market disruption, and the reliability and transparency of the assumptions\nused to determine fair value. The hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. The levels of the hierarchy and those investments\nincluded in each are as follows:\nLevel 1—Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. Included are those\ninvestments traded on an active exchange, such as the Nasdaq Global Select Market, U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies,\ntogether with corporate debt securities that are generally investment grade.\nLevel 2—Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\nassets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.\nMunicipal and corporate bonds, and residential mortgage-backed securities, that are traded in less active markets are classified as Level 2. These securities are\nvalued using market price quotations for recently executed transactions.\nLevel 3—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable for the asset or liability and are significant to the fair value measurement. Material assumptions\nand factors considered in pricing investment securities and other assets may include appraisals, projected cash flows, market clearing activity or liquidity\ncircumstances in the security or similar securities that may have occurred since the prior pricing period.\nThe availability of observable inputs varies and is affected by a wide variety of factors. When the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less\nobservable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment. The degree of judgment exercised by\nmanagement in determining fair value is greatest for investments categorized as Level 3. For investments in this category, the Company considers prices and\ninputs that are current as of the measurement date. In periods of market dislocation, as characterized by current market conditions, the ability to observe prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause a security to be reclassified between levels.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

The Company earned\nceding commission revenue under its quota share reinsurance agreements that expired prior to the 2021/2023 Treaty based on: (i) a fixed provisional\ncommission rate at which provisional ceding commissions were earned, and (ii) under certain of the quota share reinsurance agreements, a continuing sliding\nscale of commission rates and ultimate treaty year loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each of these agreements based upon which contingent ceding\ncommissions are earned. The sliding scale includes minimum and maximum commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. The commission rate\nand contingent ceding commissions earned increase when the estimated ultimate loss ratio decreases and, conversely, the commission rate and contingent\nceding commissions earned decrease when the estimated ultimate loss ratio increases.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

Balances due from reinsurers for contingent ceding commissions on quota share treaties are settled\nperiodically based on the Loss Ratio of each treaty year that ends on June 30, for the expired treaties that were subject to contingent commissions. As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, net contingent ceding commissions payable to reinsurers\nunder all treaties was approximately $3,302,000 and $2,667,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive loss.\nF-35\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

The Ordinary Dividend Paying\nCapacity of KICO as defined above was zero and, accordingly, the Company was not required to make a mandatory redemption of the 2022 Notes on\nDecember 30, 2023.\nThe 2022 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not the obligations of or guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes\nrank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated or junior in right of\npayment to the 2022 Notes.

Management plans to refinance the 2022 Notes with a new issue of equity securities and/or debt of similar or longer maturity that would result in net\nproceeds equal to or greater than the principal amount of the current issue. In connection therewith, the Company will be utilizing investment bankers to serve\nas placement agents for proposed offerings by the Company of its securities (including debt, equity and/or preferred securities).

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $7,273 favorable and $2,699,862 unfavorable, respectively.\nLoss and LAE reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where\nan unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods – historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate\nestimate of IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the year ended December 31, 2022 is net of estimated forfeitures\nof approximately 18%. Such amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other operating\nexpenses.\nNo options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of stock options at the grant date are estimated using the Black-\nScholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no\nvesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected\nstock price volatility. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the\nsubjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable\nsingle measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining\nNumber of Exercise Price Contractual Aggregate\nStock Options Shares per Share Term Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.92 $ -\nGranted - $ - - $ -\nExercised - $ - - $ -\nExpired/Forfeited - $ - - $ -\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 0.94 $ -\nVested and Exercisable at December 31, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 0.94 $ -\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at December 31, 2023 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of\nthe underlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $2.13 closing\nprice of the Company’s Common Stock on December 31, 2023. No options were exercised, forfeited or expired during the year ended December 31, 2023. The\ntotal intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation under the 2021/2022\nOffering was approximately $-0- and $15,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive loss.\nAt the end of the 2021/2022 Offering period, 33,222 shares of Common Stock were issued at $1.82 per share to participating employees for a total purchase\nprice of $60,464.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the Exchange Agreement (see Note 9 – Debt – “Note and Warrant Exchange”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants to the Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. The fair value of the warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes. The fair value of the warrants is being\namortized over the life of the warrants, which is 36.5 months.\nThe warrants are exercisable through December 30, 2025 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the warrants may exercise their outstanding\nwarrants in cash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market\nvalue equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following weighted average assumptions were used for grants during the following periods:\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nDividend Yield n/a 0.00%\nVolatility n/a 57.45%\nRisk-Free Interest Rate n/a 4.00%\nExpected Life n/a 3 years\nF-50\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nNote 13 - Statutory Financial Information and Accounting Policies\nFor regulatory purposes, KICO prepares its statutory basis financial statements based on statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by the New\nYork State Department of Financial Services (the “DFS”). The DFS requires insurance companies domiciled in New York State to prepare their statutory\nfinancial statements in accordance with Statements of Statutory Accounting Principles as promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\n(the “NAIC”), subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the DFS. These statutory accounting practices differ substantially from GAAP used by most\nbusiness entities. The more significant variances from GAAP are as follows:\n• Policy acquisition costs are charged to operations in the year such costs are incurred, rather than being deferred and amortized as premiums are earned\nover the terms of the policies.\n• Ceding commission revenues are earned when ceded premiums are written except for ceding commission revenues in excess of anticipated acquisition\ncosts, which are deferred and amortized as ceded premiums are earned. GAAP requires that all ceding commission revenues be earned as the underlying\nceded premiums are earned over the term of the reinsurance agreements.\n• Certain assets including certain receivables, a portion of the net deferred tax asset, prepaid expenses and furniture and equipment are not admitted.\n• Investments in fixed-maturity securities are valued at NAIC value for statutory financial purposes, which is primarily amortized cost. GAAP requires\ncertain investments in fixed-maturity securities classified as available-for-sale, to be reported at fair value.\n• Certain amounts related to ceded reinsurance are reported on a net basis within the statutory basis financial statements. GAAP requires these amounts to\nbe shown gross.\n• For SAP purposes, changes in deferred income taxes relating to temporary differences between net income for financial reporting purposes and taxable\nincome are recognized as a separate component of gains and losses in surplus rather than included in income tax expense or benefit as required under\nGAAP.\nState insurance laws restrict the ability of KICO to declare dividends. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Dividends are\nrestricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, net of dividends paid by\nKICO during such period. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. Generally,\ndividends may be paid without the need for DFS approval from unassigned surplus, and the amount of an insurer’s unassigned surplus following payment of\nany dividends must be reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, unassigned deficit was $7,661,958 and $5,069,593, respectively, and accordingly, dividends may not be paid without DFS\napproval. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, KICO paid dividends to Kingstone of $1,250,000 and $5,250,000, respectively. For the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, KICO recorded statutory basis net income (loss) of $1,343,111 and $(14,498,676), respectively. At December 31, 2023\nand 2022, KICO reported statutory basis surplus as regards policyholders of $62,683,974 and $67,976,439, respectively, as filed with the DFS.\nF-51\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nNote 14 - Risk Based Capital\nState insurance departments impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements on insurance enterprises. The RBC Model serves as a benchmark for the\nregulation of insurance companies by state insurance regulators. RBC provides for targeted surplus levels based on formulas, which specify various weighting\nfactors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk, and are set forth in the RBC requirements. Such\nformulas focus on four general types of risk: (a) the risk with respect to the company’s assets (asset or default risk); (b) the risk of default on amounts due from\nreinsurers, policyholders, or other creditors (credit risk); (c) the risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing\nbusiness to be written in the coming year (underwriting risk); and (d) the risk associated with items such as excessive premium growth, contingent liabilities,\nand other items not reflected on the balance sheet (off-balance sheet risk). The amount determined under such formulas is called the authorized control level\nRBC (“ACL”).\nThe RBC guidelines define specific capital levels based on a company’s ACL that are determined by the ratio of the company’s total adjusted capital (“TAC”)\nto its ACL. TAC is equal to statutory capital, plus or minus certain other specified adjustments. The Company’s TAC was above the ACL for each of the last\ntwo years and is in compliance with RBC requirements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 15 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\nThe provision for income taxes is comprised of the following:\nYears ended ended December 31, 2023 2022\nCurrent federal income tax expense $ - $ -\nCurrent state income tax expense 2,730 1,630\nDeferred federal and state income benefit (1,199,915) (5,419,176)\nIncome tax benefit $ (1,197,185) $ (5,417,546)\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\nYears ended December 31, 2023 2022\nComputed expected tax benefit $ (1,546,925) 21.0% $ (5,867,891) 21.0%\nState taxes, net of Federal benefit (271,543) 3.7 (190,894) 0.7\nState valuation allowance 282,864 (3.8) 198,217 (0.7)\nPermanent differences\nDividends received deduction (74,323) 1.0 (122,331) 0.4\nNon-taxable investment income (98,767) 1.3 (95,763) 0.3\nStock-based compensation 62,801 (0.9) 117,700 (0.4)\nSale leaseback transaction 315,894 (4.3) 385,634 (1.4)\nOther permanent differences 96,789 (1.3) 152,601 (0.5)\nPrior year tax matters 27,460 (0.4) (24,116) 0.1\nOther 8,565 (0.1) 29,297 (0.1)\nIncome tax benefit, as reported $ (1,197,185) 16.3% $ (5,417,546) 19.4%\nF-52\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 5,283,016 $ 3,828,947\nClaims reserve discount 1,204,334 1,238,544\nUnearned premium 2,742,603 3,574,840\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 1,986,782 2,230,109\nNet unrealized losses on securities 3,357,463 4,920,837\nOther 1,153,903 503,692\nTotal deferred tax assets 15,728,101 16,296,969\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,158,538 5,002,085\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 153,201 99,183\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,176,282 5,965,811\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 10,551,819 $ 10,331,158\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nType of NOL 2023 2022 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2023 and 2022 $ 5,283,016 $ 3,828,947 None\nState only (A) 2,560,372 2,276,595 December 2027 - December 2043\nValuation allowance (2,560,372) (2,276,595)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 5,283,016 $ 3,828,947\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was\napproximately $39,390,000 and $35,025,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting subsidiary, is not subject to state income\ntaxes. KICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of generating\nenough state taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs over their remaining lives, which expire between 2027 and 2043.\nF-53\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\n(2) Deferred tax liability - investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as Commercial\nMutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative insurance company to a stock property and\ncasualty insurance company. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in consideration for the exchange of\n$3,750,000 principal amount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and unpaid interest on the surplus notes as of the date of\nconversion. As of the date of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along with the accretion of the discount on the original purchase of the\nsurplus notes totaled $2,921,319 (collectively the “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of acquisition, the deferred tax liability on the Untaxed Interest was\n$1,169,000. Under GAAP guidance for business combinations, a temporary difference with an indefinite life exists when the parent company has a lower\ncarrying value of its subsidiary for income tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was reduced to $759,543 upon the reduction of federal income tax rates as of\nDecember 31, 2017. The Company is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of $759,543 related to this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is\nsold, or the assets of KICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\nThe table below reconciles the changes in net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) to the deferred income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nIncrease in net deferred income tax assets $ (220,661)\nLess: Deferred tax expense allocated to other comprehensive income 979,254\nDeferred income tax benefit $ (1,199,915)\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. If any had been recognized these would have\nbeen reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 through December 31, 2022 remain subject to examination.\nF-54\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy.

Diluted loss per\ncommon share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants as well as\nnon-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted loss per common share excludes those options and warrants with an exercise price in excess of\nthe average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented.\nThe computation of diluted loss per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where the exercise\nof such options and warrants or the vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, no\noptions, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have been anti-dilutive for the\nrelevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per common share has not\nbeen adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per common share follows:\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 10,756,487 10,645,365\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options - -\nWarrants - -\nRestricted stock awards - -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding,\nused for computing diluted loss per share 10,756,487 10,645,365\nNote 19 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated events that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2023 through April 1, 2024, the date these consolidated financial statements\nwere issued, for matters that required disclosure or adjustment in these consolidated financial statements.\nReinsurance\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Company entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for its personal lines business and a new underlying excess of loss\ntreaty (see Note 7 – Reinsurance).\nF-60\nTable of Contents\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.

The transferred portion of a Nonstatutory Stock Option may\nonly be exercised by the person or entity who acquires a proprietary interest in such Option pursuant to the transfer. The terms applicable to the transferred\nportion shall be the same as those in effect for the Option immediately prior to such transfer and shall be set forth in such documents issued to the transferee as\nthe Committee may deem appropriate. As used in the Plan, the terms “Grantee” (when referring to an Option recipient) and “holder of an Option” shall refer to\nthe grantee of the Option and not any transferee thereof.\n12. Effect of Termination of Employment or Death on Options.\n(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement and except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 12 and\nSection 19 hereof, if the employment of an employee by, or the services of a non-employee director for, or consultant or advisor to, the Company or a parent or\nsubsidiary of the Company, shall terminate for any reason, then his Option may be exercised at any time within three months after such termination, subject to\nthe provisions of subsection (d) of this Sections 12. For purposes of this subsection (a), an employee, non-employee director, consultant or advisor who leaves\nthe employ or services of the Company to become an employee or non-employee director of, or a consultant or advisor to, a parent or subsidiary of the\nCompany or a corporation (or subsidiary or parent of the corporation) which has assumed the Option of the Company as a result of a corporate reorganization\nor like event shall not be considered to have terminated his employment or services.\n(b) Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if the holder of an Option under the Plan dies (i) while employed by, or while\nserving as a non-employee director for or a consultant or advisor to, the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) within three months after the\ntermination of his employment or services for any reason, then such Option may, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12, be exercised by\nthe estate of the employee or non-employee director, consultant or advisor, or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such Option by bequest or\ninheritance or by reason of the death of such employee or non-employee director, consultant or advisor, at any time within one year after such death.\n(c) Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, if the holder of an Option under the Plan ceases employment or services\nbecause of permanent and total disability (within the meaning of Section 23(e)(3) of the Code) (“Permanent Disability”) while employed by, or while serving\nas a non-employee director for or consultant or advisor to, the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company, then such Option may, subject to the\nprovisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12, be exercised at any time within one year after his termination of employment, termination of directorship or\ntermination of consulting or advisory services, as the case may be, due to the disability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company is a party to\nan employment, consulting or advisory agreement with a Grantee and such agreement provides for termination of employment or engagement based upon a\ndisability or other incapacity, then, for such Grantee, a termination of employment or engagement for disability or other incapacity pursuant to the provisions\nthereof shall be considered to be a termination based upon Permanent Disability for purposes hereof. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect\nto Stock Awards that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, Permanent Disability shall mean that a Grantee is disabled under Section 409A(a)(2)(c)(i) or (ii)\nof the Code.\n6\n(d) Subject to Sections 6 and 19 hereof and this Section 12, an Option may not be exercised pursuant to this Section 12 except to the\nextent that the holder was entitled to exercise the Option at the time of termination of employment, termination of directorship, termination of consulting or\nadvisory services, or death, and in any event may not be exercised after the expiration of the Option.\n(e) For purposes of this Section 12, the employment relationship of an employee of the Company or of a parent or subsidiary of the\nCompany will be treated as continuing intact while he is on military or sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence (such as temporary employment by the\nGovernment) if such leave does not exceed 90 days, or, if longer, so long as his right to reemployment is guaranteed either by statute or by contract.\n13. Exercise of Options.\n(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, any Option granted under the Plan shall be exercisable, subject to vesting, in\nwhole at any time, or in part from time to time, prior to expiration. The Committee, in its absolute discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement that the\nexercise of any Options granted under the Plan shall be subject (i) to such condition or conditions as it may impose, including, but not limited to, a condition\nthat the holder thereof remain in the employ or service of, or continue to provide consulting or advisory services to, the Company or a parent or subsidiary of\nthe Company for such period or periods from the date of grant of the Option as the Committee, in its absolute discretion, shall determine; and (ii) to such\nlimitations as it may impose, including, but not limited to, a limitation that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of\nthe Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any employee during any calendar year (under all plans\nof the Company and its parents and subsidiaries) shall not exceed $100,000. In addition, in the event that under any Award Agreement the aggregate Fair\nMarket Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first\ntime by any employee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and its parents and subsidiaries corporations) exceeds $100,000, the\nCommittee may, when shares are transferred upon exercise of such Options, designate those shares which shall be treated as transferred upon exercise of an\nIncentive Stock Option and those shares which shall be treated as transferred upon exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock Option.\n(b) An Option granted under the Plan shall be exercised by the delivery by the holder thereof to the Company at its principal office\n(attention of the Secretary) of written notice of the number of shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised. Such notice shall be accompanied, or\nfollowed within ten days of delivery thereof, by payment of the full option price of such shares, and payment of such option price shall be made by the holder’s\ndelivery of (i) his check payable to the order of the Company, or (ii) previously acquired Common Stock, the Fair Market Value of which shall be determined\nas of the date of exercise (provided that the shares delivered pursuant hereto are acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion) or (iii) if provided for in the\nAward Agreement, and subject to the provisions of applicable law, his check payable to the order of the Company in an amount at least equal to the par value of\nthe Common Stock being acquired, together with a promissory note, in form and upon such terms as are acceptable to the Committee, made payable to the\norder of the Company in an amount equal to the balance of the exercise price, or (iv) by the holder’s delivery of any combination of the foregoing (i), (ii) and\n(iii). Alternatively, if provided for in the Award Agreement, the holder may elect to have the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a\nnumber of shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price of the Option being exercised.\n7\n14. Further Conditions of Exercise of Options.\n(a) Unless prior to the exercise of the Option the shares issuable upon such exercise have been registered with the Securities and\nExchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, the notice of exercise shall be accompanied by a representation or agreement of the person or estate\nexercising the Option to the Company to the effect that such shares are being acquired for investment purposes and not with a view to the distribution thereof,\nand such other documentation as may be required by the Company, unless in the opinion of counsel to the Company such representation, agreement or\ndocumentation is not necessary to comply with the Securities Act.\n(b) If the Common Stock is listed on any securities exchange, including, without limitation, Nasdaq, the Company shall not be\nobligated to deliver any Common Stock pursuant to this Plan until it has been listed on each such exchange. In addition, the Company shall not be obligated to\ndeliver any Common Stock pursuant to this Plan until there has been qualification under or compliance with such federal or state laws, rules or regulations as\nthe Company may deem applicable. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such listing, qualification and compliance.\n15. [Intentionally Omitted]\n16. Stock Bonus Grants.\n(a) The Committee may grant Stock Bonus awards to such persons eligible under the Plan as the Committee may select from time to\ntime. Stock Bonus awards shall be granted at such times, in such amounts and under such other terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, which\nterms and conditions shall be evidenced under an Award Agreement, subject to the terms of the Plan. Upon satisfaction of any conditions, limitations and\nrestrictions set forth in the Award Agreement, a Stock Bonus award shall entitle the recipient to receive payment of a bonus described under the Stock Bonus\naward in the form of shares of Common Stock. Prior to the date on which a Stock Bonus award is required to be paid under an Award Agreement, the Stock\nBonus award shall constitute an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to distribute Common Stock in the future.\n8\n(b) The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Stock Bonus Awards upon the attainment of specified Performance Goals set\nforth on Exhibit A as the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion. Such Performance Goals may incorporate provisions for disregarding (or adjusting\nfor) changes in accounting methods, corporate transactions (including, without limitation, dispositions and acquisitions) and other similar type events or\ncircumstances. The applicable Performance Goals shall be based on one or more of the performance criteria set forth in Exhibit A hereto.\n(c) Shares granted pursuant to a Stock Bonus shall vest as determined by the Committee, as provided for in the Award Agreement. The\nforegoing notwithstanding (but subject to the discretion of the Committee and Section 19 hereof and except as otherwise provided in the Award Agreement), a\nGrantee shall forfeit the right to receive all shares not previously vested, if any, at such time as the Grantee is no longer employed by, or serving as a director\nof, or rendering consulting or advisory services to, the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company for any reason.\n17. Adjustment Upon Change in Capitalization.\n(a) In the event that the outstanding Common Stock is hereafter changed by reason of reorganization, merger, consolidation,\nrecapitalization, reclassification, stock split-up, combination of shares, reverse split, stock dividend or the like, an appropriate adjustment shall be made by the\nCommittee in (i) the aggregate number of shares available under the Plan, (ii) the number of shares and option price per share subject to outstanding Options,\n(iii) the number of shares issuable pursuant to outstanding Stock Bonus grants, and (iv) any limitation on exercisability referred to in Section 13(a)(ii) hereof\nwhich is set forth in outstanding Incentive Stock Options. If the Company shall be reorganized, consolidated, or merged with another corporation, subject to the\nprovisions of Section 22 hereof, the holder of an Option shall be entitled to receive upon the exercise of his Option, and the Grantee of a Stock Bonus shall be\nentitled to receive upon satisfaction of any conditions, limitations and restrictions set forth in the Award Agreement with respect to the Stock Bonus, the same\nnumber and kind of shares of stock or the same amount of property, cash or securities as he would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of any such\ncorporate event as if he had been, immediately prior to such event, the holder of the number of shares covered by his Option or subject to the Stock Bonus;\nprovided, however, that, in such event, the Committee shall have the discretionary power to take any action necessary or appropriate to prevent any Incentive\nStock Option granted hereunder which is intended to be an “incentive stock option” from being disqualified as such under the then existing provisions of the\nCode or any law amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto; and provided, further, that in such event the Committee shall have the discretionary power to take\nany action necessary or appropriate to prevent such adjustment from being deemed or considered as the adoption of a new plan requiring shareholder approval\nunder Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.\n(b) Any adjustment in the number of shares shall apply proportionately to only the unexercised portion of the Option, or the unissued\nshares subject to an outstanding Stock Bonus, granted hereunder. If fractions of a share would result from any such adjustment, the adjustment shall be revised\nto the next lower whole number of shares.\n9\n18. Rights of Grantees. The holder of an Option granted under the Plan shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the\nCommon Stock covered by his Option until such Common Stock shall be transferred to him upon the exercise of his Option. The recipient of a Stock Bonus\nunder the Plan shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Common Stock covered by the Stock Bonus until the date on which the Grantee\nis entitled to receive the Common Stock pursuant to the Award Agreement.\n19. Special Provisions as to Vesting.\n(a) Notwithstanding anything hereinabove to the contrary, in the event a Grantee is not an employee or non-employee director of, or a\nconsultant or advisor to, the Company as of a particular vesting date for a Stock Award due to death or termination of employment, termination of directorship,\nor termination of consulting or advisory services due to Permanent Disability, then, for purposes of the Plan and the Stock Award, the Grantee shall be deemed\nto have remained an employee or non-employee director of, or a consultant or advisor to, the Company through the vesting date next following the Grantee’s\ndeath or termination of employment, termination of directorship, or termination of consulting or advisory services due to Permanent Disability.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) occurs, then, immediately prior\nto the Change of Control, all outstanding Stock Awards granted pursuant to Section 16 hereof shall become fully vested.\n(c) For purposes hereof, a “Change of Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if:\n(i) any “person” or “group of persons” (as such terms are used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than\nthe Grantee or any “group of persons” that includes the Grantee), becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange\nAct), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the Company’s then\noutstanding securities having the right to vote on the election of directors (“Voting Securities”), except that there shall be excluded from the calculation any\nVoting Securities acquired from the Company with respect to which the Grantee, if a director, gave his approval as a member of the Board;\n(ii) individuals who, as of the date on which the Plan is adopted by the Board, constitute the Board (the “Incumbent Board”)\ncease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to such date whose\nelection, or nomination for election by the Company’s stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the\nIncumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual\nwhose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other\nactual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board; or\n10\n(iii) the Company consummates (A) a reorganization, merger or consolidation of the Company, with respect to which in each\ncase all or substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of the Voting Securities of the Company immediately prior to such reorganization,\nmerger or consolidation do not, following such reorganization, merger or consolidation, beneficially own, directly and indirectly, more than 50% of the then\ncombined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the corporation or other person\nresulting from such reorganization, merger of consolidation, or (B) the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.\n(d) For purposes hereof, “Cause” shall mean (i) the Grantee’s conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction of the commission of\nany act in the performance of the Grantee’s duties constituting common law fraud or a felony, (ii) the Grantee’s commission of any act involving moral\nturpitude which the Board reasonably believes may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (“Material Adverse\nEffect”), or (iii) the Grantee’s engagement in gross negligence or willful misconduct which the Board reasonably believes will have a Material Adverse Effect.\nThe term “Material Adverse Effect” includes the loss or suspension of any license for the Company to operate or any disqualification or suspension for the\nGrantee to serve as an officer or director of the Company under applicable law. No act or failure to act by the Grantee shall be considered “Cause” if the\nGrantee’s act or failure to act was based on authority or express direction given by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or the advice of counsel for the\nCompany.\n(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12 hereof, in the event a Grantee is deemed to have remained an employee or non-\nemployee director of, or a consultant or advisor to, the Company through the vesting date next following the Grantee’s death or termination of employment,\ntermination of directorship, or termination of consulting or advisory services due to Permanent Disability, as provided for above, then, with respect to any\nOption that is subject thereto, such Option, with respect to such next vesting, shall remain exercisable until the later of (A) three months following such next\nvesting date or (B) one year following the date of death or date of termination of employment, termination of directorship, or termination of consulting or\nadvisory services due to Permanent Disability, as the case may be, subject to the provisions of paragraph (d) of Section 12 hereof.\n20.

In the event such notice is given, the Option shall become immediately exercisable in full. With regard to a merger or\nconsolidation, any such Option exercise shall take effect immediately prior to the closing of such transaction. In the event such merger or consolidation is not\nconsummated within six (6) months of the date of the notice given to the holder of the Option, such notice and any such exercise shall be deemed null and void.\n23. “Market Stand‑off”.

The foregoing provisions\nof this Section 23 shall be applicable to the Grantees only if all officers, directors, and stockholders individually owning more than 5% of the Company’s\noutstanding Common Stock are subject to the same restrictions. The underwriters in connection with such registration are intended third‑party beneficiaries of\nthis Section 23 and shall have the right, power, and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party to the Award Agreement executed\npursuant hereto. Each Grantee shall execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with such registration that are\nconsistent with this Section 23 or that are necessary to give further effect thereto.\n13\n24.

The foregoing shall not be deemed to limit the vesting period for Options, SARs, or Stock Bonuses granted pursuant to the Plan.\n(b) The Plan may from time to time be terminated, modified, or amended if Stockholder Approval of the termination, modification or\namendment is obtained.\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) hereof, the Board may at any time, on or before the Termination Date, without Stockholder\nApproval, terminate the Plan, or from time to time make such modifications or amendments to the Plan as it may deem advisable; provided, however, that the\nBoard shall not, without Stockholder Approval, (i) increase (except as otherwise provided by Section 17 hereof) the maximum number of shares as to which\nIncentive Stock Options may be granted hereunder, change the designation of the employees or class of employees eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options,\nor make any other change which would prevent any Incentive Stock Option granted hereunder which is intended to be an “incentive stock option” from\nqualifying as such under the then existing provisions of the Code or any law amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto or (ii) make any other modifications\nor amendments that require Stockholder Approval pursuant to applicable law, regulation or exchange requirements. In the event Stockholder Approval is not\nreceived within one year of adoption by the Board of the change provided for in (i) or (ii) above, then, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement (but\nsubject to applicable law), the change and all Stock Awards that may have been granted pursuant thereto shall be null and void.\n14\n(d) No termination, modification, or amendment of the Plan may, without the consent of the Grantee to whom any Stock Award shall\nhave been granted, adversely affect the rights conferred by such Stock Award.\n26. Not a Contract of Employment. Nothing contained in the Plan or in any Award Agreement executed pursuant hereto shall be deemed to\nconfer upon any individual or entity to whom a Stock Award is or may be granted hereunder any right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or a\nparent or subsidiary of the Company or any entitlement to any remuneration or other benefit pursuant to any consulting or advisory arrangement.\n27. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to Stock Awards granted under the Plan shall constitute general funds of\nthe Company.\n28. Indemnification of Board of Directors or Committee. In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have, the members\nof the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, shall be indemnified by the Company to the extent permitted under applicable law against all costs and\nexpenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action\ntaken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any rights granted thereunder and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof or paid\nby them in satisfaction of a judgment of any such action, suit or proceeding, except a judgment based upon a finding of bad faith. Upon the institution of any\nsuch action, suit, or proceeding, the member or members of the Board or the Committee, as the case may be, shall notify the Company in writing, giving the\nCompany an opportunity at its own cost to defend the same before such member or members undertake to defend the same on his or their own behalf.\n29. Captions. The use of captions in the Plan is for convenience. The captions are not intended to provide substantive rights.\n30. Disqualifying Dispositions. If Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan is disposed of\nwithin two years following the date of grant of the Incentive Stock Option or one year following the issuance of the Common Stock to the Grantee, or is\notherwise disposed of in a manner that results in the Grantee being required to recognize ordinary income, rather than capital gain, from the disposition (a\n“Disqualifying Disposition”), the holder of the Common Stock shall, immediately prior to such Disqualifying Disposition, notify the Company in writing of the\ndate and terms of such Disqualifying Disposition and provide such other information regarding the Disqualifying Disposition as the Company may reasonably\nrequire.\n31. Withholding Taxes.\n(a) Whenever under the Plan shares of Common Stock or cash are to be delivered to a Grantee upon exercise of a Nonstatutory Stock\nOption or to a Grantee of a Stock Bonus, the Company shall be entitled to require as a condition of delivery that the Grantee remit or, at the discretion of the\nCommittee, agree to remit when due, an amount sufficient to satisfy all current or estimated future Federal, state and local income tax withholding\nrequirements, including, without limitation, the employee’s portion of any employment tax requirements relating thereto. At the time of a Disqualifying\nDisposition, the Grantee shall remit to the Company in cash the amount of any applicable Federal, state and local income tax withholding and the employee’s\nportion of any employment taxes.\n15\n(b) The Committee may, in its discretion, provide any or all holders of Nonstatutory Stock Options or Grantees of Stock Bonus with\nthe right to use shares of Common Stock in satisfaction of all or part of the withholding taxes to which such holders may become subject in connection with the\nexercise of their Options or their receipt of a Stock Bonus. Such right may be provided to any such holder in either or both of the following formats:\n(i) The election to have the Company withhold, from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of\nsuch Nonstatutory Stock Option or the satisfaction of the conditions, limitations and restrictions with respect to a Stock Bonus, a portion of those shares with\nan aggregate fair market value equal to the percentage of the withholding taxes (not to exceed 100%) designated by the holder.\n(ii) The election to deliver to the Company, at the time the Nonstatutory Stock Option is exercised or the conditions,\nlimitations and restrictions are satisfied for a Stock Bonus, one or more shares of Common Stock previously acquired by such holder (other than in connection\nwith the Option exercise or Stock Bonus grant triggering the withholding taxes) with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the percentage of the withholding\ntaxes (not to exceed 100%) designated by the holder.\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, permit the use of shares of Common Stock, as provided for in\nparagraph (b) hereof, to satisfy income tax liabilities of the Grantee in excess of withholding tax requirements provided that such additional income tax\nliabilities are reasonably likely to be incurred by the Grantee.\n32. Excise Tax. In the event any Stock Award hereunder shall become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, or\nany similar or successor provision of federal, state or local law, the Grantee shall not be paid any amounts to offset the tax effect of such excise tax or taxes.\n33. Section 409A of the Code. Although the Company does not guarantee the particular tax treatment of Stock Awards granted under the Plan,\nStock Awards made under the Plan are intended to comply with, or be exempt from, the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the Plan and\nany Award Agreement hereunder shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that any Stock Award is subject to\nSection 409A of the Code, it shall be paid in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including proposed, temporary or final regulations or\nany other guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service with respect thereto. In no event whatsoever shall the Company or\nany of its affiliates be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on a Grantee by Section 409A of the Code or any damages for\nfailing to comply with Section 409A of the Code or this Section 33. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or in a Stock Award to the contrary, the following\nprovisions shall apply to any Stock Award granted under the Plan that constitutes \"non-qualified deferred compensation\" pursuant to Section 409A of the Code\n(a “409A Covered Award”):\n16\n(a) A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of a 409A Covered Award\nproviding for payment upon or following a termination of the Grantee’s employment unless such termination is also a \"Separation from Service\" within the\nmeaning of Code Section 409A and, for purposes of any such provision of a 409A Covered Award, references to a “termination,” “termination of employment”\nor like terms shall mean Separation from Service. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Plan or the Stock Award, if the Grantee is deemed on the\ndate of the Grantee’s termination of service to be a “specified employee” within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B) and using the\nidentification methodology selected by the Company from time to time, or if none, the default methodology set forth in Code Section 409A, then with regard to\nany such payment under a 409A Covered Award, to the extent required to be delayed in compliance with Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B), such payment shall not\nbe made prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of the Grantee’s Separation from Service, and (ii) the date\nof the Grantee’s death. All payments delayed pursuant to this Section 33 shall be paid to the Grantee on the first day of the seventh month following the date of\nthe Grantee’s Separation from Service or, if earlier, on the date of the Grantee’s death.\n(b) Whenever a payment under a 409A Covered Award specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days, the actual date\nof payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company.\n(c) If under a 409A Covered Award an amount is to be paid in two or more installments, for purposes of Code Section 409A, each\ninstallment shall be treated as a separate payment.\n34. Other Provisions. Each Stock Award under the Plan may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be\ndetermined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Incentive Stock Option granted under the Plan shall include those\nterms and conditions which are necessary to qualify the Incentive Stock Option as an “incentive stock option” within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code\nand the regulations thereunder and shall not include any terms and conditions which are inconsistent therewith.\n35. Governing Law. The Plan shall be governed by, and all questions arising hereunder shall be determined in accordance with, the laws of\nthe State of Delaware, excluding choice of law principles thereof.\n17\nExhibit A\nPERFORMANCE GOALS\nPerformance Goals for the purposes of the vesting of performance-based Stock Awards shall be based upon one or more of the following business\ncriteria (which may be determined for these purposes by reference to (i) the Company as a whole, (ii) any of the Company’s subsidiaries, operating divisions,\nregional business units or other operating units, or (iii) any combination thereof): profit before taxes, stock price, market share, gross revenue, net revenue, pre-\ntax income, operating income, cash flow, earnings per share, return on equity, return on invested capital or assets, cost reductions and savings, return on\nrevenues or productivity, or any other business criteria the Committee deems appropriate, which may be modified at the discretion of the Committee to take\ninto account significant nonrecurring items, or an event or events either not directly relating to the operations of the Company or not within the reasonable\ncontrol of the Company’s management, or a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles, or which may be adjusted to\nreflect such costs or expenses as the Committee deems appropriate.\n18\nEXHIBIT 10(J)\nKINGSTONE COMPANIES, INC.\n15 Joys Lane\nKingston, New York 12401\nSeptember 18, 2023\nBarry B.

The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Kingstone Companies, Inc. (the “Company”) has adopted this clawback policy, as amended (the\n“Clawback Policy”), which describes the circumstances in which Covered Individuals will be required to repay or return Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nto the Company in the event of an Accounting Restatement in accordance with Clawback Rules issued by the United States Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the “Exchange”).\nCapitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given in Section 2 or 4 below.\n2. Covered Persons. A “Covered Individual” under this Clawback Policy shall mean (i) each individual who served as an Executive Officer at any time\nduring the performance period applicable to the Incentive Compensation, whether or not still employed by the Company (and regardless of whether such\nIncentive Compensation was received during or after such person’s service as an Executive Officer) and (ii) such other current or former employees of the\nCompany who may from time to time be deemed subject to this Clawback Policy by the Administrator. Each Covered Individual shall be required to sign and\nreturn to the Company a Clawback Policy Acknowledgement and Acceptance Form pursuant to which, among other things, such Covered Individual will\nacknowledge that he or she is bound by the terms of this Clawback Policy; provided, however, that this Clawback Policy shall apply to, and be enforceable\nagainst, any Covered Individual and his or her successors (as specified in Section 9 of this Clawback Policy) regardless of whether or not such Covered\nIndividual properly signs and returns to the Company such Clawback Policy Acknowledgement and Acceptance Form and regardless of whether or not such\nCovered Individual is aware of his or her status as such.\n3. Administration. Except as specifically set forth herein, this Clawback Policy shall be administered by the Administrator. Any determinations made\nby the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected Covered Individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each Covered Individual. Subject to\nany limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions\nnecessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Clawback Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Clawback Policy\ninvolving such officer or employee).\n4. Definitions. For purposes of this Clawback Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below:\na. “Accounting Restatement” shall mean an accounting restatement: (i) due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (a “Big R” restatement); or (ii) that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement).\nb. “Administrator” shall mean the Committee.\nc. “Clawback Period” shall mean, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately\npreceding the Restatement Date and any transition period (that results from a change in the Company’s fiscal year) of less than nine months\nwithin or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nd. “Clawback Rules” shall mean Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules or standards adopted by the SEC thereunder\n(including Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act) or the Exchange pursuant to Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act (including Nasdaq Stock\nMarket Listing Rule 5608), in each case as may be in effect from time to time.\ne. “Committee” shall mean the Compensation and Finance Committee of the Board or any of the other committee designated by the Board to\nadminister this Clawback Policy.\nf. “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means, with respect to any Covered Individual, the excess of (i) the Covered Individual’s actual\nIncentive Compensation over (ii) the Incentive Compensation the Covered Individual otherwise would have earned, become vested in or\nbeen granted during the Clawback Period if the Company’s financial statements had reflected the restated amounts in an Accounting\nRestatement. Erroneously Awarded Compensation will be computed without regard to taxes paid. Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall\nnot include any Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Individual prior to a Covered Individual’s service as an Executive Officer.\nCalculation of Erroneously Awarded Compensation with respect to Incentive Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return,\nwhere the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an\nAccounting Restatement, shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total\nshareholder return upon which the Incentive Compensation was received, and the Company shall maintain documentation of the\ndetermination of such reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the Exchange in accordance with the Clawback Rules.\nIncentive Compensation is deemed received, earned or vested when the Financial Reporting Measure is attained, not when the actual\npayment, grant or vesting occurs. Incentive Compensation received by a Covered Individual prior to the Effective Date shall be subject to\nthe terms of this Clawback Policy as if in effect prior to the Effective Date.\ng. “Effective Date” shall mean March __, 2024.\nh. “Executive Officer” means the Company’s president, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or, if there is no such\naccounting officer, the controller), any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit, division, or function (such as\nsales, administration, or finance), any other officer who performs a policy-making function, or any other person who performs similar\npolicymaking functions for the Company. Executive officers of the Company’s parent(s) or subsidiaries are deemed executive officers of the\nCompany if they perform such policy making functions for the Company.\ni. “Financial Reporting Measures” shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used\nin preparing the Company’s financial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures.

Recoupment; Method of Recoupment.\na. In the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator shall reasonably promptly, in accordance\nwith the applicable Clawback Rules, determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for each Covered Individual in\nconnection with such Accounting Restatement, and shall reasonably promptly thereafter provide each Covered Individual with written\nnotice containing the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment or return, as applicable.\nb. The method of recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined by the Administrator and shall include, without\nlimitation: (i) recoupment of cash or shares of Company stock; (ii) forfeiture of unvested awards; (iii) cancellation of outstanding vested\nawards; (iv) offset of other amounts owed to the Covered Individual; (v) reduction of future compensation; and (vi) any other remedial or\nrecovery action permitted by law. If the Erroneously Awarded Compensation includes shares of Company stock (or derivatives thereof), the\nAdministrator may seek to require that the Covered Individual repay to the Company any dividends or dividend equivalents paid with\nrespect to those securities, and any profits realized, directly or indirectly, from the sale or other disposition of those securities. For the\navoidance of doubt, except to the extent permitted pursuant to the Clawback Rules, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is\nless than the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Individual’s obligations hereunder.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated in this Section 5(b) if\nrecovery would be Impracticable. In implementing the actions contemplated in this Section 5(b), the Administrator will act in accordance\nwith the listing standards and requirements of the Exchange and with the applicable Clawback Rules.\nc. Subject to the discretion of the Administrator, an applicable Covered Individual may be required to reimburse the Company for any and all\nexpenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance with\nthis Section 5.\n6. Indemnification Prohibition. No member of the Company shall be permitted to indemnify any Covered Individual against the loss of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Clawback Policy and/or pursuant to the Clawback Rules,\nincluding any payment or reimbursement for the cost of third-party insurance purchased by any Covered Individual to cover any such loss under this Clawback\nPolicy and/or pursuant to the Clawback Rules. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive Compensation from the\napplication of this Clawback Policy or that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Clawback Policy shall\nsupersede any such agreement, whether entered into before, on or after the Effective Date). Any such purported indemnification, whether oral or in writing,\nshall be null and void.\n7. Interpretation. The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Clawback Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate,\nor advisable for the administration of this Clawback Policy. It is intended that this Clawback Policy be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the\nrequirements of the Clawback Rules. The terms of this Clawback Policy shall also be construed and enforced in such a manner as to comply with applicable\nlaw, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and any other law or regulation that the\nAdministrator determines is applicable. In the event any provision of this Clawback Policy is determined to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law,\nsuch provision shall be applied to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner consistent with its\nobjectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required by applicable law.\n8. Amendment; Termination. The Administrator may modify or amend this Clawback Policy, in whole or in part, from time to time, in its discretion\nand shall amend any or all of the provisions of this Clawback Policy as it deems appropriate and necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally\nrequired by the Clawback Rules, any federal securities laws, state blue-sky laws, SEC rule or Exchange rule. The Administrator may terminate this Clawback\nPolicy at any time, and this Clawback Policy shall remain in effect only so long as the Clawback Rules apply to the Company. Unless otherwise determined by\nthe Administrator or as otherwise amended, this Clawback Policy shall automatically be deemed amended in a manner necessary to comply with any change in\nthe Clawback Rules.\n9. Successors. This Clawback Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Individuals and their beneficiaries, estates, heirs, executors,\nadministrators or other legal representatives to the extent required by the Clawback Rules or as otherwise determined by the Administrator.\n10. Tax Considerations. To the extent that, pursuant to this Clawback Policy, the Company is entitled to recover any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is received by a Covered Individual, the gross amount received (i.e., the amount the Covered Individual received, or was entitled to receive,\nbefore any deductions for tax withholding or other payments) shall be returned by the Covered Individual.\nCLAWBACK POLICY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE FORM\nThe Board of Directors of Kingstone Companies, Inc. has adopted a Clawback Policy which is applicable to the Company’s Covered Individuals.\nI, the undersigned, acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Clawback Policy, as it may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from\ntime to time, and that I have read it, understand it, and acknowledge that I am fully bound by, and subject to, all of the terms and conditions thereof.\nIn the event of any inconsistency between the terms of the Clawback Policy and the terms of any employment agreement to which I am a party, or the\nterms of any compensation plan, program, or arrangement under which Incentive Compensation has been granted, awarded, earned, or paid to me, whether or\nnot deferred, the terms of the Clawback Policy shall govern.\nIf the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors determines that any Incentive Compensation I have received must be forfeited,\nrepaid, or otherwise recovered by the Company, I shall promptly take whatever action is necessary to effectuate such forfeiture, repayment, or recovery.\nI acknowledge that I am not entitled to indemnification in connection with the Company’s enforcement of the Clawback Policy.\nI understand that any delay or failure by the Company to enforce any requirement contained in the Clawback Policy will not constitute a waiver of the\nCompany’s right to do so in the future.

Such guidance remains\nsubject to change based on management's ongoing review of the Company's 2024 results and is a forward-looking statement (see “Forward-Looking Statements”). Kingstone assumes\nno obligation to update this guidance. The actual results may be materially different and are affected by the risk factors and uncertainties identified in the press release accompanying\nthis presentation and in Kingstone's annual and quarterly filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nDEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES 21\nDirect premiums written represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period. Net premiums written are direct premiums\nwritten less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct premiums written and net premiums written, are net premiums written\nthat are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct premiums written and net\npremiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. Direct premiums written and net premiums written are provided as\nsupplemental information, not as a substitute for net premiums earned, and do not reflect the Company’s net premiums earned.\nAdjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock- based\ncompensation. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to adjusted EBITDA.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense,\nincome tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, net gains (losses) on investments, and stock-based compensation, and may vary significantly between periods. Adjusted\nEBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share exclusive of net gains (losses) on investments, net of tax.\nNet income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share.\nManagement uses operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which\ncan be skewed when including net gains (losses) on investments, and may vary significantly between periods. Operating income (loss) and diluted operating income (loss) per share is\nprovided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and diluted net income (loss) per share and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability.\nOperating return on equity is operating income (loss) divided by average equity. Return on equity is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating return on equity.\nManagement uses operating return on equity, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including net gains\n(losses) on investments, which may vary significantly between periods. Operating return on equity is provided as supplemental information, is not a substitute for return on equity and\ndoes not reflect the Company’s overall return on average common equity.\nNet loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net loss ratio and the effect of catastrophes on the net loss\nratio.\nManagement believes that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in the Company’s business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses.\nCatastrophe losses cause the Company’s loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on\nthe net loss ratio. Management believes that this measure is useful for investors to evaluate this component separately when reviewing the Company’s underwriting performance. The\nmost directly comparable GAAP measure is the net loss ratio. The net loss ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes should not be considered a substitute for the net loss ratio and does\nnot reflect the Company’s net loss ratio.\nRECONCILIATION OF DIRECT PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND NET\n22\nPREMIUMS WRITTEN TO NET PREMIUMS EARNED\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % Change\n(000’s except percentages)\nDirect and Net Premiums Written Reconciliation:\nDirect premiums written $52,938 $53,901 (1.8%) $200,175 $201,255 (0.5%)\nCeded premiums written1 (15,554) (12,928) 20.3% (106,564) (94,241) 13.1%\nNet premiums written1 37,384 40,973 (8.8%) 93,611 107,014 (12.5%)\nChange in unearned premiums1 (8,701) (10,525) (17.3%) 20,774 7,371 181.8%\nNet premiums earned $28,683 $30,448 (5.8%) $114,384 $114,385 (0.0%)\n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\n1Ceded premiums written balances, net premiums written balances and change in unearned premiums balances from prior year\nperiods were reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

This will allow you to see how much progress the Kingstone team has made on our Kingstone 3.0 initiatives. I have laid out below the four main pillars to our 2023 strategy, and I note that we are on track or ahead of plan for each as follows:\n\n  1. _Aggressively Reduce Non-Core Business_ --Losses incurred on the non-Core business were unacceptable, and we could no longer allow that to continue. While underwriting and pricing efforts were made to correct this over the prior few years, we were not successful and macro trends such as inflation and reinsurance pricing only made matters worse. We stopped writing all new business outside of New York and have been aggressively reducing policy count this year, subject to regulatory requirements. Our non-Core policy count is down by 35% year to date, and we expect this decline to accelerate to about 50% by year-end 2023 and to more than 80% by year-end 2024.\n  2. _Adjust Pricing to Stay Ahead of Trends_ --Inflation has been a dominant headwind that we hope is receding. We have been cognizant that inflation's impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and, as such, we have been more frequent and aggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that same inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we completed our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes were insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums attributable to the heightened replacement costs. Overall average written premium for our Legacy New York homeowners policies for the last 12 months, reflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 25.5%. Let me remind you that most of the added premiums have not yet been earned and will be reflected in future quarters.\n  3. _Tightly Manage Reinsurance Requirements_ --We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the required limit to be purchased while maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new business that was deemed to be too expensive and at the same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the greatest risk. The combination of stricter new business underwriting and increased non-renewals gave rise to the 4.5% decline in policy count for our Core book. We have now reverted most of our new business underwriting standards back to what they were previously so Core new business growth should increase going forward.\n  4. _Reduce Expenses_ --We have been unrelenting in driving down our costs. We set a 2023 goal to achieve a 33% net underwriting expense ratio by year end. For this quarter, the net underwriting expense ratio was 31.7%, a reduction of 5.2 points in spite of the 4.8% decline in net earned premiums. For nine months, we have achieved our 33% goal. We remain fixated on reducing our costs and hope we can continue to improve on this very important metric.\n\n\n\nMs. Golden continued,**\"** Increasing rates and getting ahead of loss costs including inflation has been a key theme and our pricing team has responded marvelously. While there is more work to be done, we are again comfortable expanding our Core new business writings and look forward to growing our Core business in 2024 while continuing to reduce the non-Core business. We believe that the small remaining non-Core policies, after repeated rate increases and re-underwriting, will no longer have the negative impact they once had.\n\nEach of the changes called for in Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 have been made, are in place and at work. The financial effects are now flowing through to our income statement at an accelerating rate and that makes me confident that 2024 will be a great year for the Company and its shareholders. We are generating underwriting income in New York, and that will grow substantially in 2024 when the benefits of the increase in average premiums are earned. On an overall company basis, as we run off our non-Core business, the losses are shrinking and will be less and less of a factor in 2024. We are bullish about the future.\"\n\nJennifer Gravelle, Kingstone's Chief Financial Offer, continued, \"We are making great progress on the Kingstone 3.0 initiatives that will return Kingstone to profitability. Our non-Core business is down markedly and our average Core premiums have increased materially. While my tenure with Kingstone began in January, my depth of experience was gained in Florida. I have been able to bring my knowledge of reinsurance and deploy many things I learned while working in Florida. Working closely with the underwriting and actuarial teams, we did a great job managing our reinsurance needs. Our expense ratio is down by more than 5 points this quarter. We are doing everything we can to return Kingstone to profitability. I feel confident that we'll continue to see the progress we've made increasingly reflected in our financial results.\"\n\nSee \"Forward-Looking Statements\"\n\n**Financial Highlights Table**\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n($ in thousands except per share data) |  **2023** |  **2022** |  **% Change** |  **2023** |  **2022** |  **% Change**  \nDirect written premiums1 | $ | 51,992 | $ | 54,592 | -4.8 | % | $ | 147,237 | $ | 147,354 | -0.1 | %  \nNet written premiums1,2 | $ | 3,675 | $ | 11,097 | -66.9 | % | $ | 56,227 | $ | 66,041 | -14.9 | %  \nNet premiums earned | $ | 27,938 | $ | 29,361 | -4.8 | % | $ | 85,701 | $ | 83,936 | 2.1 | %  \nTotal ceding commission revenue | $ | 5,536 | $ | 4,886 | 13.3 | % | $ | 16,394 | $ | 14,283 | 14.8 | %  \nNet investment income | $ | 1,444 | $ | 1,419 | 1.8 | % | $ | 4,437 | $ | 3,412 | 30.0 | %  \nNet gains (losses) on investments | $ | (824) | $ | (398) | 107.0 | % | $ | 598 | $ | (9,313) | na  \nU.S. GAAP loss | $ | (3,538) | $ | (3,998) | 11.5 | % | $ | (9,114) | $ | (18,575) | 50.9 | %  \nU.S. GAAP Diluted loss per share | $ | (0.33) | $ | (0.38) | 13.2 | % | $ | (0.85) | $ | (1.75) | 51.4 | %  \nComprehensive loss | $ | (5,763) | $ | (7,982) | 27.8 | % | $ | (10,275) | $ | (36,350) | 71.7 | %  \nNet operating loss1 | $ | (2,886) | $ | (3,683) | 21.6 | % | $ | (9,586) | $ | (11,217) | 14.5 | %  \nNet operating loss1 per share | $ | (0.27) | $ | (0.35) | 22.9 | % | $ | (0.89) | $ | (1.05) | 15.2 | %  \nNet loss ratio | 78.5 | % | 75.0 | % | 3.5 pts | 77.7 | % | 75.8 | % | 1.9 pts  \nNet underwriting expense ratio | 31.7 | % | 36.9 | % | -5.2 pts | 33.0 | % | 37.2 | % | -4.2 pts  \nNet combined ratio | 110.2 | % | 111.9 | % | -1.7 pts | 110.7 | % | 113.0 | % | -2.3 pts  \nEffect of catastrophes and prior year loss  \ndevelopment on net combined ratio1 | 7.7 pts | 2.6 pts | 5.1 pts | 8.5 pts | 5 pts | 3.6 pts  \nNet combined ratio excluding effect of  \ncatastrophes and prior year loss  \ndevelopment1 | 102.5 | % | 109.3 | % | -6.8 pts | 102.2 | % | 108.0 | % | -5.8 pts  \n  \n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\n\n1 These measures are not based on GAAP and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n2 Net written premiums balances from prior year periods were reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

**\n\n__Net loss:_ _\n\nNet loss during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 was $3.5 million as compared to a net loss of $4.0 million in the prior year period. The $0.5 million decrease in net loss in the latest three-month period is primarily attributable to a decrease in commissions and other underwriting expenses and an increase in ceding commissions, partially offset by an increase in interest expense and a decrease in net premiums earned primarily resulting from an increase in catastrophe premiums.\n\n__Earnings (Loss) per share (\"EPS\"):_ _\n\nKingstone reported a loss of $(0.33) per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a loss of $(0.38) per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2022. EPS for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were based on 10.8 million and 10.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively.\n\n__Direct Written Premiums,_ _1_ _Net Written Premiums_ _1_ _and Net Premiums Earned_ _\n\nDirect written premiums1 for the third quarter of 2023 were $52.0 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 4.8%, from $54.6 million in the prior year period. Most of the decrease was in Personal Lines, which decreased $2.8 million, or 5.5%, from actions taken to aggressively reduce the business in non-Core states.\n\nNet written premiums1 decreased $7.4 million, or 66.9%, to $3.7 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 from $11.1 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in direct written premiums and an increase in catastrophe premiums rates.\n\nNet premiums earned for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 decreased 4.8% to $27.9 million, compared to $29.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The $1.4 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in Personal Lines of $2.1 million offset by an increase in Livery Physical Damage of $0.6 million.\n\n__Net Loss Ratio_ _:\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company's net loss ratio was 78.5%, compared to 75.0% in the prior year period.\n\nWhile the underlying loss ratio (i.e., net loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year loss development) was improved for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, the catastrophe loss had a bigger impact for the 2023 period.\n\nThere were six wind events classified as catastrophes for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The total net catastrophe losses for the calendar quarter were $2.2 million, which contributed 7.7 points to the net loss ratio. This compares to a 1.1point impact from catastrophe events for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\n\nThe underlying loss ratio was 70.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.6 points from the 72.4% underlying loss ratio recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The loss experience for the 2023 period was improved due to lower frequency, resulting from writing higher quality business in the new Select product as well as the reduction of the book in the non-Core states. The improvement in frequency was offset by increased severity due to inflation and large losses, similar to what was observed in the first six months of 2023.\n\nPrior year development was stable for the three months ended September 30, 2023. There was an overall unfavorable development of $3,000, which had a marginal impact on the net loss ratio.\n\n____________________\n\n  1. These measures are not based on GAAP and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n\n\n__Net Underwriting Expense Ratio_ _:\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the net underwriting expense ratio was 31.7% as compared to 36.9% in the prior year period, a decrease of 5.2 percentage points. The decrease in the quarter was primarily attributable to a reduction in commission and underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premium.\n\n**_Balance Sheet / Investment Portfolio_ **\n\nKingstone's cash and investment holdings were $172.1 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $192.2 million at September 30, 2022. The Company's investment holdings are comprised primarily of investment grade corporate, mortgage-backed and municipal securities, with fixed income investments representing approximately 89.1% of total investments at September 30, 2023 and 86.4% at September 30, 2022. The Company's effective duration on its fixed-income portfolio is 4.3 years.\n\nNet investment income remained stable at $1.4 million for both the third quarter of 2023 and the prior year period.\n\n_Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss (AOCI), net of tax_\n\nAs of September 30, 2023, AOCI was a loss of $(17.1) million compared to a loss of $(16.0) million at September 30, 2022. The decrease in AOCI at September 30, 2023 of $1.1 million as compared to September 30, 2022 is attributable to the increase in interest rates.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Program_ **\n\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.\n\n**_Book Value_ **\n\nThe Company's book value per share at September 30, 2023 was $2.47, a decline of 32.3% compared to $3.65 at September 30, 2022.\n\n**30-Sep-23** |  **30-Jun-23** |  **31-Mar-23** |  **31-Dec-22** |  **30-Sep-22**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Book Value Per Share** | $ | 2.47 | $ | 2.98 | $ | 3.09 | $ | 3.38 | $ | 3.65  \n_% Increase from specified period to 9/30/23_ |  _-17.1_ | % |  _-20.1_ | % |  _-26.9_ | % | -32.3% | %  \n  \n**_Conference Call Details_ **\n\nManagement will discuss the Company's operations and financial results in a conference call on Monday, November 13, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe dial-in numbers are:\n\n(877) 407-3105 (U.S.)\n\n(201) 493-6794 (International)\n\n**_Accompanying Webcast_ **\n\nThe call will be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the Kingstone website or by clicking on the conference call link:\n\n[Kingstone Companies Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results Webcast](https://pr.report/IQ5tazc2)\n\nThe webcast will be archived and accessible for approximately 30 days.\n\n**_Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures_ **\n\n**_Direct written premiums_ ** represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period. **_Net premiums written_** are direct written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct written premiums and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company's policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct written premiums and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results.\n\n**_Net operating income (loss)_ ** - is net income (loss) exclusive of realized investment gains (losses), net of tax. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to net operating income (loss).\n\nManagement uses net operating income (loss) along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including realized investment gains (losses), and may vary significantly between periods. Net operating income (loss) is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.\n\n**_Operating EBITDA_ ** - is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and realized investment gains (losses). Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating EBITDA.\n\nManagement uses operating EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and realized investment gains (losses), and may vary significantly between periods. Operating EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.\n\n**_Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income_ ** - is book value per share excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income or AOCI. Management uses book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to evaluate the results to exclude the impact of interest rate changes on our fixed income portfolio.\n\n**_Net combined ratio excluding effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development_ ** - is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development on the net combined ratio.\n\nWe believe that these ratios are useful to investors and they are used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year loss development. Catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio and net combined ratio. Prior year loss development can cause our loss ratio to vary significantly between periods and separating this information allows us to better compare the results for the current accident period over time. We believe these measures are useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance. We also provide them to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net combined ratio. The net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development should not be considered a substitute for the net combined ratio and does not reflect the Company's net combined ratio.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**The table below reconciles direct written premiums and net written premiums to net premiums earned for the periods presented:**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended** |  **For the Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**%** |  **%**  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **$ Change** |  **Change** |  **2023** |  **2022** |  **$ Change** |  **Change**  \n(000's except percentages)  \n**Direct and Net Written Premiums Reconciliation:**  \n**Direct written premiums** | $ | 51,992 | $ | 54,592 | $ | (2,600) | (4.8) | % | $ | 147,237 | $ | 147,354 | $ | (117) | (0.1) | %  \nCeded written premiums1 | (48,317) | (43,495) | (4,822) | 11.1 | (91,010) | (81,313) | (9,697) | 11.9  \n**Net written premiums** | 3,675 | 11,097 | (7,422) | (66.9) | 56,227 | 66,041 | (9,814) | (14.9)  \nChange in unearned premiums | 24,263 | 18,264 | 5,999 | 32.8 | 29,475 | 17,896 | 11,579 | 64.7  \n**Net premiums earned** |  **$** |  **27,938** |  **$** |  **29,361** |  **$** |  **(1,423)** |  **(4.8)** |  **%** |  **$** |  **85,701** |  **$** |  **83,936** |  **$** |  **1,765** |  **2.1** |  **%**  \n  \n(Components may not sum due to rounding)\n\n1 Net written premiums balances from prior year periods were reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. For more details on factors that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A (\"Risk Factors\") of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part I, Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following:\n\n  * Assumptions for projected policies in force for our non-Core business are based on quantifying regulatorily approved withdrawal and block non-renewal plans, agent resignations and natural attrition of the book of business.\n  * As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\n  * Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n  * We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\n  * The insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\n  * Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\n  * Because a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\n  * We are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\n  * Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n  * We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\nKingstone undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\n**CONTACT:**\n\n**_Kingstone Companies, Inc._ **\n\nJennifer Gravelle Chief Financial Officer (845) 768-1970\n\n**SOURCE:** Kingstone Companies, Inc\n\nView source version on [accesswire.com](http://accesswire.com): <https://www.accesswire.com/801698/kingstone-announces-2023-third-quarter-financial-results>\n"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nKingstone Companies, Inc. (referred to herein as \"Kingstone\" or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), underwrites property and casualty insurance exclusively through\nretail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is a licensed insurance company in the States of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,\nPennsylvania, Connecticut, Maine and New Hampshire. KICO is actively writing its property and casualty insurance products in New York. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, 88.5% and 80.5%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, 88.1% and 80.3%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written premiums came from the New York policies.\nKingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO\nfor the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The principles for condensed interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 31, 2023. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited\nby an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) but, in\nthe opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation\nof the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 may not be indicative of\nthe results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023.\nComponents of ceded premiums within prior year net earned premiums in Note 6 were reclassified to conform with an elected change in the current year\npresentation by recording ceded written premiums for the 12 months of the contract term at inception, rather than monthly over the contract term, providing a\nfull disclosure of the premium ceded. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously reported financial condition, results of operations or cash\nflows.\nNote 2 – Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, which include the reserves for losses and loss\nadjustment expenses “(LAE)”, which are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported\nand settled over a period of many years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with receivables under reinsurance contracts related to contingent\nceding commission revenue require judgments by management. On an ongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating\nthese estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, CMIC Properties, Inc. (“Properties”) and 15 Joys Lane, LLC (“15 Joys Lane”), which together own the land and building from which KICO\noperates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This new guidance applies to reinsurance and insurance receivables and other\nfinancing receivables. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities carried at fair value, estimated credit losses will continue to be measured at the present\nvalue of expected cash flows; however, the other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) concept has been eliminated. Under the previous guidance, estimated\ncredit impairments resulted in a write-down of amortized cost. Under the new guidance, estimated credit losses are recognized through an allowance and\nreversals of the allowance are permitted if the estimate of credit losses declines. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where the Company has an\nintent to sell, impairment will continue to result in a write-down of amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The\nCompany determined as of the date of adoption that the updated guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Below is a summary\nof the significant accounting policies impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is reported as a reduction of a financial asset’s cost basis and is measured on a pool basis when\nsimilar risk characteristics exist. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Historical\ncredit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and adjustments may be made to reflect current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for any additional factors that come to the Company’s attention. This could\ninclude significant shifts in counterparty financial strength ratings, aging of past due receivables, amounts sent to collection agencies, or other underlying\nportfolio changes. Amounts are considered past due when payments have not been received according to contractual terms. The Company also considers\ncurrent and forecasted economic conditions, using a variety of economic metrics and forecast indices. The sensitivity of expected credit losses relative to\nchanges to these forecasted economic conditions can vary by financial asset class. The Company considers a reasonable and supportable forecast period to be\nup to 24 months from the balance sheet date. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical credit experience. The Company uses collateral\narrangements such as letters of credit and amounts held in beneficiary trusts to mitigate credit risk, which are considered in the estimate of net amount expected\nto be collected.\nThe Company has made a policy election to present accrued interest balances separately from the amortized cost basis of assets and has elected the practical\nexpedient to exclude the accrued interest from the tabular disclosures for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. The Company has elected not to\nestimate an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. The accrual of interest income is discontinued and the asset is placed on nonaccrual\nstatus in the quarter that payment becomes delinquent.

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 was $16,420 favorable and $713,788 unfavorable, respectively. Management, on a quarterly basis,\nperforms a review of open liability claims to assess carried case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve levels, giving consideration to both Company\nand industry trends.\nLoss and LAE Reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\n22\nTable of Contents\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where\nan unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods – historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate\nestimate of IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\n23\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\nIn New York State, lawsuits for negligence are subject to certain limitations and must be commenced within three years from the date of the accident or are\notherwise barred. Accordingly, the Company’s exposure to unreported claims (“pure” IBNR) for accident dates of September 30, 2020 and prior is limited,\nalthough there remains the possibility of adverse development on reported claims (“case development” IBNR). In certain rare circumstances states have\nretroactively revised a statute of limitations. The Company is not aware of any such effort that would have a material impact on the Company’s results.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of September 30, 2023, net of reinsurance, as well as the cumulative reported\nclaims by accident year and total IBNR reserves as of September 30, 2023 included in the net incurred loss and allocated expense amounts.

As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net contingent ceding commissions payable to\nreinsurers under all treaties was approximately $2,007,000 and $2,667,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive loss.\nNote 7 – Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nIn July 2017, KICO became a member of, and invested in, the FHLBNY. KICO is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of FHLBNY. Based on\nredemption provisions of FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its discretion, FHLBNY may declare dividends on the\nstock. Management reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nno impairment has been recognized. FHLBNY members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling\nmembers to customize advances, which are to be fully collateralized. Eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account\navailable for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the previous quarter and are due and payable within one year of\nborrowing. KICO is currently able to borrow on an overnight basis. If KICO has collateral, based on KICO’s net admitted assets, the maximum allowable\nadvance as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately $12,668,000 and $13,192,000, respectively. Available collateral as of September\n30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately $10,911,000 and $12,228,000, respectively. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available\ncollateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n29\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nDebt as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consists of the following:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\n2022 Notes, net $ 18,129,327 $ 17,252,868\nEquipment financing 7,095,366 7,905,655\nBalance at end of period $ 25,224,693 $ 25,158,523\nNote and Warrant Exchange\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “Exchanging\nNoteholders”) of the Company’s outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging\nNoteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes then\noutstanding. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on December 15, 2022, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for the\nfollowing: (i) new 12.0% Senior Notes due December 30, 2024 of the Company in the aggregate approximate principal amount of $19,950,000 (the “2022\nNotes”); (ii) cash in the aggregate approximate amount of $1,595,000, together with accrued interest on the 2017 Notes; and (iii) three-year warrants for the\npurchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock of the Company, exercisable at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (the “Warrants”). The\nremaining $8,455,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, together with accrued interest thereon, was paid on the maturity date of the 2017 Notes of December\n30, 2022.\n2022 Notes\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company issued $19,950,000 of its 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears\non June 30 and December 30 of each year, which commenced on June 30, 2023 at the rate of 12.0% per annum.

The amount of other operating expenses paid in\ncash in the preceding clause (ii) shall not exceed $2.5 million. Holding Company Expenses will be determined based on the actual Holding Company Expenses\nfor the nine months ending September 30, 2023, and an estimate of Holding Company Expenses for the three months ending December 30, 2023.\nThe 2022 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not the obligations of or guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes\nrank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated or junior in right of\npayment to the 2022 Notes. The Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness, but are effectively\nsubordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. In addition, the 2022 Notes are\nstructurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe 2022 Notes are redeemable, at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than fifteen (15) nor more\nthan sixty (60) days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof) if redeemed during the respective\nperiod set forth below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant\nrecord date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date):\nPeriod: Percentage\nDecember 30, 2022 to December 29, 2023 102.00%\nDecember 30, 2023 to September 29, 2024 101.00%\nSeptember 30, 2024 to December 29, 2024 100.00%\nAs of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the Company is subject to a leverage maintenance\ntest (“Leverage Maintenance Test”), which requires that the Total Consolidated Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company not be greater than 30% of\nTotal Consolidated Capitalization (as defined below). As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the ratio as defined under the Leverage Maintenance\nTest was 31.4% and 26.7%, respectively. On November 7, 2023, a majority of the holders of the outstanding 2022 Notes (on behalf of all holders of the 2022\nNotes) agreed to a waiver regarding the satisfaction of the Leverage Maintenance Test as of September 30, 2023. See Note 13 – Subsequent Events. “Total\nConsolidated Indebtedness” is the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any Indebtedness issued with more than de minimis original\nissue discount) of all outstanding long-term of the Company except for the sale leaseback transaction described below under “Equipment Financing”, any\nrefinancing or any future sale leaseback transaction. “Total Consolidated Capitalization” is the amount equal to the sum of (x) Total Consolidated Indebtedness\noutstanding as of such date and (y) the total consolidated shareholders’ equity of the Company, excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, as\nrecorded on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEquipment Financing\nOn October 27, 2022, KICO entered into a sale leaseback transaction, whereby KICO sold $8,096,824 of fixed assets to a bank. Under GAAP, the sale\nleaseback transaction is recorded as equipment financing (“Financing”). The provisions of the Financing require KICO to pay a monthly payment of principal\nand interest at the rate of 5.86% per annum totaling $126,877 for a term of 60 months, which commenced on October 27, 2022. The terms of the Financing\nprovide buyout options to KICO at the end of the 60 month term, which are as follows:\n· At the end of the lease, KICO may purchase the fixed assets for a purchase price of $2,024,206, which is 25% of the original fixed asset cost of\n$8,096,824; or\n· KICO may renew the lease for 16 months at the same rental rate, which totals $2,030,036.\nA provision of the Financing requires KICO to pledge collateral for the lease obligation. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of\nrequired collateral was approximately $7,422,000 and $8,691,000, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of KICO’s\npledged collateral was approximately $8,168,000 and $8,691,000, respectively, in United States Treasury securities.\nFuture contractual payment obligations under the Financing as of September 30, 2023 are as follows:\nFor the Year\nEnding\nDecember 31, Total\nRemainder of 2023 $ 278,083\n2024 1,153,862\n2025 1,223,293\n2026 1,296,901\n2027 1,119,021\n5,071,160\n2027 purchase price 2,024,206\nTotal $ 7,095,366\nNote 8 – Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends Declared and Paid\nDividends declared and paid on Common Stock were $-0- and $1,277,066 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On\nNovember 11, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends. Future dividend policy will be subject to the\ndiscretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.\n2014 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which a maximum of 700,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses. Incentive stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\n(except no later than five years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan,\nsubject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. On August 5, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan, including an increase in\nthe maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,400,000. On August 9, 2023,\nthe Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are\nauthorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,900,000.\n32\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nThe results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 include stock-based compensation expense for stock options totaling\napproximately $-0- and $2,000, respectively. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 include stock-based\ncompensation expense for stock options totaling approximately $-0- and $9,000, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022 is net of estimated forfeitures of approximately 18%. Such amounts have been included in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other operating expenses.\nNo options were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of stock options at the grant date are estimated using the\nBlack-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which\nhave no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the\nexpected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because\nchanges in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily\nprovide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted\nWeighted Average\nAverage Remaining Aggregate\nNumber of Exercise Price Contractual Intrinsic\nStock Options Shares per Share Term Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.92 $ -\nGranted - $ - - $ -\nExercised - $ - - $ -\nExpired/Forfeited - $ - - $ -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.18 $ -\nVested and Exercisable at September 30, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.18 $ -\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at September 30, 2023 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of\nthe underlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $1.79 closing\nprice of the Company’s Common Stock on September 30, 2023. No options were exercised, forfeited or expired during the nine months ended September 30,\n2023. The total intrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture. The total intrinsic value of options when expired are\ndetermined as of the date of expiration.\n33\nTable of Contents\nParticipants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise\nissuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised, or by exchanging a number of shares owned\nfor a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were no unvested options.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were 591,383 shares reserved for grants under the 2014 Plan.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the restricted Common Stock activity under the 2014 Plan for nine months ended September 30, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value Aggregate\nRestricted Stock Awards Shares per Share Fair Value\nBalance at January 1, 2023 366,597 $ 6.97 $ 2,555,181\nGranted 272,682 $ 1.37 $ 373,499\nVested (56,977) $ 6.67 $ (380,199)\nForfeited (12,620) $ 4.11 $ (51,926)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 569,682 $ 3.83 $ 2,181,882\nFair value was calculated using the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date. For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022, stock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $207,000 and $186,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, stock-based\ncompensation for these grants was approximately $636,000 and $1,180,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. These amounts reflect the Company’s accounting expense and do not correspond to\nthe actual value that will be recognized by the directors, executives and employees.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn June 19, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Kingstone Companies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), subject to\nstockholder approval. Such approval was obtained on August 10, 2021. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company with an\nopportunity to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be\npurchased under the ESPP is 750,000, subject to adjustment as provided for in the ESPP. The ESPP was effective August 10, 2021 and expires on August 10,\n2031. A maximum of 5,000 shares of Common Stock may be purchased by an employee during any offering period.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe initial offering period under the ESPP was from November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022 (“2021/2022 Offering”). There is currently no offering\npursuant to the ESPP subsequent to October 31, 2022. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2022, stock-based compensation under the\n2021/2022 Offering was approximately $5,000 and $16,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nAt the end of the 2021/2022 Offering period, 33,222 shares of Common Stock were issued at $1.82 per share to participating employees for a total purchase\nprice of $60,464.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the Exchange Agreement (see Note 7 – Debt – “Note and Warrant Exchange”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants to the Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. The fair value of the warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes. The fair value of the warrants is being\namortized over the life of the warrants, which is 36.5 months.\nThe warrants are exercisable through December 30, 2025 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the warrants may exercise their outstanding\nwarrants in cash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market\nvalue equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised.\nAs of September 30, 2023, all warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly-owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\n35\nTable of Contents\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 6,411,993 $ 3,828,947\nClaims reserve discount 1,220,674 1,238,544\nUnearned premium 2,395,542 3,574,840\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 1,972,541 2,230,109\nNet unrealized losses on securities 4,912,057 4,920,837\nOther 1,193,445 503,692\nTotal deferred tax assets 18,106,252 16,296,969\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,311,788 5,002,085\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 140,761 99,183\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,317,092 5,965,811\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 12,789,160 $ 10,331,158\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers (“NOL”) are as follows:\nSeptember 30, December 31,\nType of NOL 2023 2022 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2021 - 2023 $ 6,411,993 $ 3,828,947 None\nState only (A) December 2027 - December\n2,555,609 2,276,595 2043\nValuation allowance (2,555,609) (2,276,595)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 6,411,993 $ 3,828,947\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of September 30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 was approximately $39,317,000 and $35,025,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting subsidiary, is not\nsubject to state income taxes. KICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has recorded a valuation allowance due to the\nuncertainty of generating enough state taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs over their remaining lives, which expire between\n2027 and 2043.\n36\nTable of Contents\n(2) Deferred tax liability – Investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as\nCommercial Mutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property\nand casualty insurance company. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in consideration for the\nexchange of $3,750,000 principal amount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and unpaid interest on the surplus\nnotes as of the date of conversion. As of the date of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along with the accretion of the discount on\nthe original purchase of the surplus notes totaled $2,921,319 (together “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of acquisition, the deferred tax liability on\nthe Untaxed Interest was $1,169,000. A temporary difference with an indefinite life exists when the parent has a lower carrying value of its subsidiary\nfor income tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was reduced to $759,543 upon the reduction of federal income tax rates as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of $759,543 related to this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is sold, or the\nassets of KICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. If any had been recognized these\nwould have been reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 through December 31, 2022 remain subject to examination.\nNote 10 – Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Diluted loss per\ncommon share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants as well as\nnon-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted loss per common share excludes those options and warrants with an exercise price in excess of\nthe average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented.\nThe computation of diluted loss per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where the exercise\nof such options and warrants or vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022, no options, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have been anti-\ndilutive for the relevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per common\nshare has not been adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per common share follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 10,756,156 10,645,675 10,754,709 10,640,290\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options - - - -\nWarrants - - - -\nRestricted stock awards - - - -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding,\nused for computing diluted loss per share 10,756,156 10,645,675 10,754,709 10,640,290\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy. Such proceedings are considered\nin estimating the liability for loss and LAE expenses.\nOffice Lease\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business. These leases are accounted\nfor as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nThe Company is a party to a non-cancellable operating lease, dated March 27, 2015, for its office facility for KICO located in Valley Stream, New York\nexpiring March 31, 2024.\nOn July 8, 2019, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an additional office facility for Cosi located in Valley Stream, New York under a non-\ncancelable operating lease. The lease had a term of seven years and two months expiring December 31, 2026. During January 2022, pursuant to a mutual\nagreement with the landlord at a cost of $40,000, the Cosi lease was terminated effective as of January 31, 2022.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s office operating leases is as follows:\n(1) KICO rent expense is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other underwriting\nexpenses.\n(2) Cosi rent expense is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other operating expenses.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nLease cost 2023 2022 2023 2022\nOperating lease (1) (2) $ 41,342 $ 41,342 $ 124,026 $ 131,152\nTotal lease cost (1) (2) $ 41,342 $ 41,342 $ 124,026 $ 131,152\nOther information on operating leases\nCash payments included in the measurement of lease\nliability reported in operating cash flows $ 49,145 $ 47,483 $ 145,774 $ 147,969\nDiscount rate 5.50% 5.50% 5.50% 5.50%\nRemaining lease term in years 0.50 1.50 0.50 1.50\n(1) The operating lease liability is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023:\nFor the Nine Months\nEnding\nSeptember 30, Total\nRemainder of 2023 $ 49,145\n2024 49,145\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 98,290\nLess: present value adjustment 8,993\nOperating lease liability (1) $ 89,297\n(1) The operating lease liability is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nRent expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $41,342 for both periods and is included in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss within other underwriting expenses.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO is actively\nwriting personal lines and physical damage coverage for taxi and livery vehicles primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island\nand Westchester County. KICO is also licensed in the States of New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maine, and New\nHampshire. For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, 88.5% and 88.1% of KICO’s direct written premiums came from\nthe New York policies. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business outside of New York as our “non-Core” business.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies\nit places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, Cosi’s expenses are\nnot included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies\nare written for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, these\nexpired policies represent approximately 15.5% and 17.9%, respectively, of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under\n“Additional Financial Information”.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering\nits business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and\nnet underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income,\nand may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other\nfactors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to\nmateriality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not\nmaterialize. Application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies. See the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section within Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further information.\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have\nnot been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses of investment\nsecurities, and the valuation of warrants. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2022 and Note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for accounting policies regarding the adoption of\nASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023.\nKingstone 2.0 (completed) and Kingstone 3.0 (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0” were commenced to modernize our Company. The\npillars of the new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthen the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse backgrounds;\n2. Reduce expenses and increase efficiency by embracing technology including converting to a new policy management system, retiring multiple\nlegacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Develop and implement a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk using advanced analytics\nand an abundance of data; and\n4. Better manage the Company’s catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our Probable Maximum Loss (“PML”) in\norder to mitigate the impact of the emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we\ncoined as “Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the non-Core book of business, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results, by slowing\nnew business, re-underwriting the book, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory constraints. We\nstopped writing all new non-Core business and have been aggressively reducing policy count this year. As of September 30, 2023, our non-Core\npolicy count is down by 38.9% compared to September 30, 2022;\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported in each state\nand product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value. Inflation has been a dominant headwind that is showing signs of stabilizing. We\nhave been cognizant that inflation’s impact on loss costs places added pressure on premiums and, as such, we have been more frequent and\naggressive with our rate change requests. Similarly, home replacement values reflect that same inflationary pressure. In September 2023, we\ncompleted our first cycle of valuation adjustments, making sure that all homes were insured to value. As a result, we have seen a rise in premiums\nattributable to the heightened replacement costs. Overall average written premium for our Legacy Core homeowners policies for the last 12\nmonths, reflecting both rate and replacement cost changes, increased by 25.5%;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML. We needed to contain our exposure to spiking reinsurance pricing. We did so and were able to reduce the required limit to be purchased\nwhile maintaining our same risk tolerance. We used all the tools available to us to limit new business that was deemed to be too expensive and at\nthe same time re-underwrote the book to cull those risks which presented the greatest risk. The combination of stricter new business underwriting\nand increased non-renewals gave rise to the 4.5% decline in policy count for our Core business. We have now reverted most of our new business\nunderwriting standards back to what they were previously so Core new business growth should increase going forward; and\n4. Continuing expense reduction focus with a goal of reducing the net expense ratio to 33% by year-end 2024. For the three months ended September\n30, 2023, the net underwriting expense ratio was 31.7%, a reduction of 5.2 points in spite of the 4.8% decline in net premiums earned. For the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, we achieved our 33% goal.\n46\nTable of Contents\nSee tables below comparing the quarterly trends and changes from our Core and non-Core business for policies in force and direct written premiums\nfrom September 30, 2022 through September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our Core direct written premiums have increased by\n4.7% compared to the three months ended September 30, 2022, while policies in force have decreased by 4.5% as of September 30, 2023. For the same\nperiods, our non-Core policies in force have decreased by 38.9% and direct written premiums have decreased by 43.9%.

The decrease of $117,000, or 0.1%, was primarily due to a decrease in premiums\nfrom our personal lines business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Nine Months 2023 were $136,601,000, a decrease of $1,597,000, or 1.2%, from\n$138,198,000 in Nine Months 2022. The 1.2% decrease in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to the decrease in premiums\nassociated with a 14.0% decrease in policies in force as of September 30, 2023 compared to September 30, 2022, offset by rate increases. The rate increases\nachieved along with a decrease in policies in force is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Nine Months 2023 were $10,559,000, an increase of $1,522,000, or 16.8%,\nfrom $9,037,000 in Nine Months 2022. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an\nincrease in the values of the autos insured.\nBeginning in 2017, we commenced our non-Core business and started writing personal lines policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expandedour\nnon-Core business to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut.Direct written premiums from our Core business were $129,665,000 in Nine Months 2023\ncompared to $118,332,000 in Nine Months 2022, an increase of $11,333,000, or 9.6%. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 4.5% in Nine\nMonths 2023 compared to Nine Months 2022. Direct written premiums from our non-Core business were $17,572,000 in Nine Months 2023 down from\n$29,022,000 in Nine Months 2022, a decrease of $11,450,000, or 39.5%. The decrease in direct written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our\ndecision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force from our non-Core business decreased by 38.9% in Nine Months 2023\ncompared to Nine Months 2022. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in our non-Core business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone\n3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums decreased $9,813,000, or 14.9%, to $56,228,000 in Nine Months 2023 from $66,041,000 in Nine Months 2022. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe decrease in Nine Months 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in direct written premiums and an increase in catastrophe premiums rates.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31,\n2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). In Nine Months\n2023, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties increased by $3,964,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Nine Months 2022 (see table above). The\nincrease in Nine Months 2023 was attributable to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty. The remainder of the 2021/2023 Treaty was on a\ncutoff basis and the new 2023/2024 Treaty was placed for 30% on January 1, 2023. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty in Nine\nMonths 2023, and the 2021-2023 Treaty in Nine Months 2022.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Nine Months 2023, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $924,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Nine Months 2022. The increase was due to an increase in subject\npremiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering the\nperiod from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from\nnamed storms are excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023\nthrough January 1, 2024.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. Catastrophe premiums increased $4,808,000, or 11.1%, to $48,316,000 in Nine Months 2023 from $43,508,000 in Nine Months 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to an increase in catastrophe reinsurance rates. In accordance with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 goals, we have reduced our PML in\nNine Months 2023, which partially offset the increase in premiums effective July 1, 2023.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $1,766,000, or 2.1%, to $85,701,000 in Nine Months 2023 from $83,936,000 in Nine Months 2022. The increase was\ndue in part to the increased premiums written in prior periods due to rate increases and increased replacement costs. The run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023\nTreaty increased the premiums ceded and reduced the growth of net premiums earned.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nNine months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 15,733 $ 14,116 $ 1,617 11.5%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 661 167 494 295.8%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 16,394 $ 14,283 $ 2,111 14.8%\nCeding commission revenue was $16,394,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $14,283,000 in Nine Months 2022. The increase of $2,111,000 was\ndue to an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned and an increase in contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of\nprovisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Nine Months 2023 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $15,733,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty, and in Nine Months 2022 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $14,116,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023\nTreaty. The increase of $1,617,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the increase in premiums ceded under these treaties during Nine\nMonths 2023 compared to Nine Months 2022.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2023/2024 Treaty and the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $4,437,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $3,412,000 in Nine Months 2022, an increase of $1,025,000, or 30.0%. The\nincrease in investment income is attributable to a $766,000 reversal in Nine Months 2022 of prior years’ estimated accrued interest income stemming from an\nerror in third party investment reporting. The increase was also due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances. The average yield on non-cash invested\nassets was 3.73% as of September 30, 2023 compared to 3.48% as of September 30, 2022.\nCash and invested assets were $172,095,000 as of September 30, 2023 compared to $192,229,000 as of September 30, 2022. The $20,134,000\ndecrease in cash and invested assets was primarily attributable to increased disbursements of losses in connection with higher severity and inflation’s impact on\nlosses along with catastrophe losses incurred in 2023 and prior periods. An increase in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio also contributed to the\nreduction.\n51\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $598,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to net (losses) of $(9,313,000) in Nine Months 2022. Unrealized gains on\nour equity securities and other investments in Nine Months 2023 were $615,000, compared to net unrealized (losses) of $(10,502,000) in Nine Months 2022.\nRealized (losses) on sales of investments were $(17,000) in Nine Months 2023 compared to realized gains of $1,189,000 in Nine Months 2022.\nOther Income\nOther income was $454,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $750,000 in Nine Months 2022, a decrease of $296,000, or 39.5%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $66,553,000 for Nine Months 2023 compared to $63,625,000 for Nine Months 2022. The net loss ratio was 77.7% in Nine\nMonths 2023 compared to 75.8% in Nine Months 2022, an increase of 1.9 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n52\nTable of Contents\nFor Nine Months 2023, the net loss ratio was higher than for Nine Months 2022 mainly due to a larger impact from catastrophe losses.\nThe net catastrophe losses were $7,285,000 for Nine Months 2023, which contributed 8.5 points to the loss ratio. There were two winter storm events\nincluding a major freezing event at the beginning of February, eight wind and thunderstorm events, and one tropical storm classified as catastrophe for Nine\nMonths 2023. By comparison, catastrophe events had a loss ratio impact of 4.1 points for Nine Months 2022.\nThe underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) was 69.2% for Nine Months 2023, a decrease of\n1.6 points from the 70.8% underlying loss ratio recorded for Nine Months 2022. The underlying loss experience in Nine Months 2023 was improved due to\nlower frequency, but was offset by increasing severity resulting from inflation and an elevated number of large losses.\nPrior year development was stable for Nine Months 2023. There was an overall favorable development of $16,000, which had marginal impact on the\nloss ratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $25,221,000 in Nine Months 2023 or 16.6% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $25,534,000 in Nine\nMonths 2022 or 18.1% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $313,000 was primarily due to a reduction of commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with Kingstone 3.0 as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products but offset in part by an increase in\ndirect earned premiums of $10,244,000 to $151,568,000.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $19,874,000, or 13.1% of direct earned premiums, in Nine Months 2023 compared to $20,717,000, or 14.7% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Nine Months 2022. The decrease of $843,000, or 4.1%, was primarily due to decreases in professional fees, credit card fees and\npolicy management system fees as result of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems.\nThe decreases were partially offset by increases in salaries and employment costs.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $8,692,000 in Nine Months 2023\ncompared to $8,027,000 in Nine Months 2022. The increase of $665,000, or 8.3%, is compared unfavorably to the 0.1% decrease in direct written premiums.\nIn the periods following Nine Months 2022, we continued to strengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher\ncompensated managers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies. The increase in salaries was\npartially offset by a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we have been reducing our non-Core business. The effect of staff reductions on salaries\nand employment costs is expected to have a greater impact on year to date other underwriting expenses in future periods.\n53\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Nine Months 2023 was 33.0% compared to 37.2% in Nine Months 2022.

The increase in employment costs was due to the hiring of our new Chief Financial\nOfficer in Nine Months 2023 and fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio. The decrease in\nprofessional fees is due to $316,000 incurred in Nine Months 2022 related to a then contemplated transaction that would have resulted in a third party acquiring\nall of the outstanding equity of our company.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $2,328,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $2,472,000 in Nine Months 2022. The decrease of $144,000, or\n5.8%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Nine Months 2023 was $3,005,000 compared to $1,370,000 in Nine Months 2022, an increase of $1,635,000 or 119.3%. In Nine\nMonths 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred increased interest expense in connection with the 2022\nNotes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing. In Nine Months 2022, we incurred interest expense in\nconnection with the 2017 Notes, our $30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017, which provided for interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit in Nine Months 2023 was $2,149,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 19.1%. Income tax benefit in Nine Months\n2022 was $4,433,000 which resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.3%. Loss before taxes was $11,264,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $23,007,000 in\nNine Months 2022. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Nine Months 2023 compared to Nine Months 2022.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $9,114,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $18,575,000 in Nine Months 2022. The decrease in net loss of $9,461,000 was due to the\ncircumstances described above.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2022\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 51,992 $ 54,592 $ (2,600) (4.8)%\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n51,992 54,592 (2,600) (4.8)%\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 12,210 12,919 (709) (5.5)%\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 1,726 1,194 532 44.6%\nCeded to catastrophe treaties 34,380 29,382 4,998 17.0%\nTotal ceded written premiums 48,316 43,494 4,821 11.1%\nNet written premiums 3,675 11,097 (7,422) (66.9)%\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed (1,247) (5,636) 4,389 77.9%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (1) 25,509 23,900 1,609 6.7%\nChange in net unearned premiums 24,262 18,264 5,998 na%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 50,745 48,955 1,790 3.7%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (22,807) (19,594) (3,213) (16.4)%\nNet premiums earned 27,938 29,361 (1,423) (4.8)%\nCeding commission revenue (1) 5,536 4,886 650 13.3%\nNet investment income 1,444 1,419 25 1.8%\nNet losses on investments (824) (397) (427) (107.6)%\nOther income 142 270 (128) (47.4)%\nTotal revenues 34,237 35,538 (1,303) (3.7)%\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 29,570 30,514 (944) (3.1)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 2,871 477 2,394 501.9%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 32,441 30,991 1,450 4.7%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 9,797 8,820 977 11.1%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 712 143 569 397.9%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 10,509 8,963 1,546 17.2%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 19,773 21,694 (1,921) (8.9)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 2,159 334 1,825 546.4%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 21,932 22,028 (96) (0.4)%\nCommission expense 8,210 8,702 (492) (5.7)%\nOther underwriting expenses 6,319 7,276 (957) (13.2)%\nOther operating expenses 442 810 (368) (45.4)%\nDepreciation and amortization 741 825 (84) (10.2)%\nInterest expense 989 457 532 116.4%\nTotal expenses 38,633 40,097 (1,465) (3.7)%\nLoss before taxes (4,397) (4,559) 162 3.6%\nIncome tax benefit (859) (562) (297) (52.8)%\nNet loss $ (3,538) $ (3,998) $ 460 11.5%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n(1) Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a 30% personal lines quota share treaty.\n(2) The three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a\ncatastrophe bulletin and related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO).\nPCS catastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of\npolicyholders and insurers.\n56\nTable of Contents\nThree months ended September 30,\nPercentage\nPoint Percent\n2023 2022 Change Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 78.5% 75.0% 3.5 4.7%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 31.7% 36.9% (5.2) (14.1)%\nNet combined ratio 110.2% 111.9% (1.7) (1.5)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the three months ended September 30, 2023 (“Three Months 2023”) were $51,992,000 compared to $54,592,000\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2022 (“Three Months 2022”). The decrease of $2,600,000, or 4.8%, was primarily due to a decrease in premiums\nfrom our personal lines business, partially offset by an increase in premiums from our livery physical damage business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Three Months 2023 were $48,419,000, a decrease of $2,824,000, or 5.5%, from\n$51,243,000 in Three Months 2022. The 5.5% decrease in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to a decrease in premiums associated\nwith a 14.0% decrease in policies in force as of September 30, 2023 compared to September 30, 2022, offset by rate increases. The rate increases achieved\nalong with a decrease in policies in force is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Three Months 2023 were $3,544,000, an increase of $234,000, or 7.1%, from\n$3,310,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an increase\nin the values of the autos insured.\nBeginning in 2017, we commenced our non-Core business and started writing personal lines policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded our\nnon-Core business to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Direct written premiums from our Core business were $46,025,000 in Three Months 2023\ncompared to $43,949,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $2,076,000, or 4.7%. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 4.5% in Three\nMonths 2023 compared to Three Months 2022. Direct written premiums from our non-Core business were $5,966,000 in Three Months 2023 down from\n$10,642,000 in Three Months 2022, a decrease of $4,676,000, or 43.9%. The decrease in direct written premiums from our non-Core business is a result of our\ndecision to aggressively reduce the book of business in these states. Policies in force from our non-Core business decreased by 38.9% in Three Months 2023\ncompared to Three Months 2022. The increase in direct written premiums in our Core business and the decrease in our non-Core business is consistent with a\nkey pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-Core business due to profitability concerns.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nNet written premiums decreased $7,422,000, or 66.9%, to $3,675,000 in Three Months 2023 from $11,097,000 in Three Months 2022. Net written\npremiums include direct premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe).\nThe decrease in Three Months 2023 is primarily due to changes in the terms of our catastrophe reinsurance treaty. See catastrophe reinsurance treaties\ndiscussion below.\nQuota share reinsurance treaties\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31,\n2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new 30% quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). In Three Months\n2023, our premiums ceded under quota share treaties decreased by $709,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Three Months 2022 (see table above). The\ndecrease in Three Months 2023 was attributable to the decrease in direct written premiums discussed above, partially offset by the runoff of an 8.5% portion of\nthe 30% 2021/2023 Treaty. The remainder of the 2021/2023 Treaty was on a cutoff basis and the new 2023/2024 Treaty was placed for 30% on January 1,\n2023. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty in Three Months 2023, and the 2021-2023 Treaty in Three Months 2022.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Three Months 2023, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $532,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Three Months 2022. The increase was due to an increase in subject\npremiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering the\nperiod from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from\nnamed storms are excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023\nthrough January 1, 2024.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. Catastrophe premiums increased $4,998,000, or 17.0%, to $34,380,000 in Three Months 2023 from $29,382,000 in Three Months 2022. The\nincrease was primarily due to an increase in catastrophe reinsurance rates. In accordance with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 goals, we have reduced our\nPML in Three Months 2023, which partially offset the increase in premiums effective July 1, 2023.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned decreased $1,423,000, or 4.8%, to $27,938,000 in Three Months 2023 from $29,361,000 in Three Months 2022. The decrease\nwas due to the 4.8% decrease in direct written premiums during Three Months 2023, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty, which increased the\npremiums ceded and reduced the net premiums earned, and an increase in catastrophe premiums rates, which also reduced net premiums earned. These\nreductions to net premiums earned were partially offset by the increased premiums written in prior periods due to rate increases and increased replacement\ncosts.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 4,992 $ 4,882 $ 110 2.3%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 544 4 540 13,500.0%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 5,536 $ 4,886 $ 650 13.3%\nCeding commission revenue was $5,536,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $4,886,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase of $650,000 was due\nto an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned and an increase in contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of provisional\nceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Three Months 2023 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,992,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty, and in Three Months 2022 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,882,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023\nTreaty. The increase of $110,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty, partially\noffset by a decrease in premiums subject to quota share treaties as a result of the decrease in direct written premiums discussed above.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2023/2024 Treaty and the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $1,444,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $1,419,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $25,000, or 1.8%. The\nincrease in investment income is attributable to higher interest rates earned on cash balances. The average yield on non-cash invested assets was 3.73% as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 compared to 3.48% as of September 30, 2022.\nCash and invested assets were $172,095,000 as of September 30, 2023 compared to $192,229,000 as of September 30, 2022. The $20,134,000\ndecrease in cash and invested assets was primarily attributable to increased disbursements of losses in connection with higher severity and inflation’s impact on\nlosses along with catastrophe losses incurred in 2023 and prior periods. An increase in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio also contributed to the\nreduction.\n59\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments\nNet (losses) on investments were $(824,000) in Three Months 2023 compared to net (losses) of $(398,000) in Three Months 2022. Unrealized (losses)\non our equity securities and other investments in Three Months 2023 were $(820,000) compared to net unrealized (losses) of $(1,798,000) in Three Months\n2022. Realized (losses) on sales of investments were $(4,000) in Three Months 2023 compared to realized gains of $1,400,000 in Three Months 2022.\nOther Income\nOther income was $142,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $270,000 in Three Months 2022, a decrease of $128,000, or 47.4%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $21,932,000 for Three Months 2023 compared to $22,028,000 for Three Months 2022. The net loss ratio was 78.5% in Three\nMonths 2023 compared to 75.0% in Three Months 2022, an increase of 3.5 percentage points.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n60\nTable of Contents\nFor Three Months 2023, the net loss ratio was higher than for Three Months 2022. Although the catastrophe impact for Three Months 2023 was larger\nthan for Three Months 2022, the underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) was lower.\nThere were six newly designated catastrophe events for Three Months 2023. The estimated total net catastrophe losses for the calendar quarter were\n$2,159,000, which contributed 7.7 points to the loss ratio. By comparison, the catastrophe impact for Three Months 2022 was 1.1 points.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 70.8% for Three Months 2023, a decrease of 1.6 points from the 72.4% underlying loss ratio recorded for Three Months\n2022. The underlying loss experience for Three Months 2023 was improved due to lower frequency which is believed to be the result of the Company’s new\nproduct rollout as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. The improvement in frequency was offset by increased severity due\nto inflation and large losses, similar to what was observed in the first six months of 2023.\nPrior year development was stable for Three Months 2023. There was an overall unfavorable development of $3,000, which had marginal impact on\nthe loss ratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $8,210,000 in Three Months 2023 or 16.2% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $8,702,000 in Three\nMonths 2022 or 17.8% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $492,000 was primarily due to a reduction of commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with Kingstone 3.0 as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products, but offset by an increase in direct\nearned premiums of $1,791,000 to $50,746,000.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $6,319,000, or 12.5% of direct earned premiums in Three Months 2023 compared to $7,276,000, or 14.9% of direct\nearned premiums, in Three Months 2022. The decrease of $957,000, or 13.2%, was primarily due to decreases in salaries and employment costs, credit card\nfees, and policy management system fees as result of the completion of our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy\nsystems.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $2,817,000 in Three Months 2023\ncompared to $2,961,000 in Three Months 2022. The decrease of $144,000, or 4.9%, compared favorably to the 4.8% decrease in direct written premiums. The\ndecrease in salaries and employment costs was due to a reduction in our staff in June and July of 2023 as we have been reducing our non-Core business. As an\noffset to the decrease in employment costs from staff reductions, in the periods following Three Months 2022, we continued to strengthen our professional\nteam by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0\nand Kingstone 3.0 strategies.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Three Months 2023 was 31.7% compared to 36.9% in Three Months 2022.

The decrease in professional fees is due to $268,000 incurred in Three Months 2022 related to a then\ncontemplated transaction that would have resulted in a third party acquiring all of the outstanding equity of our company. The negative balance of professional\nfees in Three Months 2023 is due to credits received on previously billed amounts. The increase in employment costs was due to the hiring of our new Chief\nFinancial Officer in January 2023 and fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $741,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $825,000 in Three Months 2022. The decrease of $84,000, or 10.2%,\nin depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Three Months 2023 was $989,000 compared to $457,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $532,000 or 116.4%. In Three\nMonths 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred increased interest expense in connection with the 2022\nNotes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing. In Three Months 2022, we incurred interest expense in\nconnection with the 2017 Notes, our $30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017, which provided for interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit in Three Months 2023 was $859,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 19.5%. Income tax benefit in Three Months\n2022 was $562,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 12.3%. Loss before taxes was $4,397,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $4,559,000 in\nThree Months 2022. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Three Months 2023 compared to Three Months 2022.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $3,538,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $3,998,000 in Three Months 2022.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources\n(“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or\nunavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for\nsimilar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level 2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market\nparticipants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level 3”). As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 62% and 65%, respectively, of the\ninvestment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the\nsecurity has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nSeptember 30, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $8,167,845 $ (56,835) 2 $ - - - $ 8,167,845 $ (56,835)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions - - - 12,414,354 (4,201,015) 13 12,414,354 (4,201,015)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous - - - 69,465,238 (8,651,516) 88 69,465,238 (8,651,516)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 204,418 (5,987) 9 38,962,381 (8,821,223) 38 39,166,799 (8,827,210)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $8,372,263 $ (62,822) 11 $120,841,973 $(21,673,754) 139 $129,214,236 $(21,736,576)\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $18,918,196 $ (6,928) 3 $ - - - $ 18,918,196 $ (6,928)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 7,970,633 (2,195,273) 9 5,170,753 (1,771,494) 5 13,141,386 (3,966,767)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 56,910,104 (5,796,994) 75 15,172,381 (2,458,985) 15 72,082,485 (8,255,979)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 10,145,880 (882,664) 22 34,753,178 (7,150,803) 26 44,899,058 (8,033,467)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $93,944,813 $(8,881,859) 109 $55,096,312 $(11,381,282) 46 $149,041,125 $(20,263,141)\n73\nTable of Contents\nThere were 150 securities at September 30, 2023 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none\nof which were deemed to be credit losses by us. There were 155 securities at December 31, 2022 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-\nmaturity securities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed to be credit losses by us. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized\nlosses were temporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the\ninvestment and interest rate environment factors, management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required\nto sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends and distributions received from KICO, which are subject to statutory\nrestrictions. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, KICO paid a dividend of $1,250,000 to us. As of September 30, 2023, KICO had a negative\nunassigned surplus and currently will not be able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval. In September 2023, KICO received\nregulatory approval and paid us a $2,700,000 distribution from paid in capital.\nKICO is a member of the FHLBNY, which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized; eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments to our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of\nKICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is June 30, 2023, and are due and payable within 90 days of borrowing. The maximum\nallowable advance as of September 30, 2023, based on the net admitted assets as of June 30, 2023, was approximately $13,268,000. Available collateral as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 was approximately $10,911,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this\nfacility during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, we issued $19,950,000 of our 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. We are required to make a mandatory\nredemption payment with regard to the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023 in an amount discussed in Note 7 – Debt of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report. We are also required to make semi-annual interest payments in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year.\nThe maturity date of the 2022 Notes is December 30, 2024.\n74\nTable of Contents\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nNine Months ended September 30, 2023 2022\nCash flows (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $(15,754,344) $ (7,921,438)\nInvesting activities 19,755,073 398,911\nFinancing activities (825,988) (1,656,865)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 3,174,741 (9,179,392)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 11,958,228 24,290,598\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 15,132,969 $ 15,111,206\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15,754,000 in Nine Months 2023 as compared to $7,921,000 used in operating activities in Nine Months\n2022. The $7,833,000 increase in cash flows used in operating activities in Nine Months 2023 as compared to Nine Months 2022 was primarily the result of an\nincrease in cash arising from net fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net loss (adjusted for non-cash items) of\n$597,000. The increase in cash used in operating activities is also partially offset by the payment of $13,245,000 to reinsurers in Nine Months 2022 pursuant to\nthe inception of our quota share reinsurance treaty, effective December 31, 2021. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities\nof KICO as affected by growth or declines in its operations, payments on claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $19,755,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $399,000 provided by investing activities in Nine\nMonths 2022 resulting in a $19,356,000 increase in net cash provided by investing activities. In Nine Months 2023, we had net cash provided by our\ninvestment portfolio of $21,135,000, compared to $3,741,000 provided in Nine Months 2022. In addition, we decreased our acquisition of fixed assets by\n$1,962,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to Nine Months 2022.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $826,000 in Nine Months 2023 compared to $1,657,000 used in Nine Months 2022. The $831,000 decrease\nin net cash used in financing activities was attributable to no dividends being paid to shareholders in Nine Months 2023 compared to $1,277,000 being paid in\nNine Months 2022 and a $378,000 decrease in withholding taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock awards. The decreases in cash used in financing\nactivities were partially offset by $810,000 of principal payments on the equipment financing in connection with KICO’s sale-leaseback transaction.\nReinsurance\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”).\nWe entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties effective July 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an\nunderlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying\nXOL Treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the Underlying\nXOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024.

Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to\nbe higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nNine Months 2023 included continuing economic inflation, which resulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower\npublic equity valuations, and significant financial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads previously reduced the value of our\nfixed income securities, saw a reversal which had previously lowered our stockholders’ equity materially in prior quarters. For Nine Months 2023, the\ncontinuing economic inflation impacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood\nnegatively impact our results of operations.\n77\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return. This action\nhas led, and may continue to lead, to a slowdown in premium growth, particularly in new business.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThis item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to assure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were: (i) effective in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on\nthis evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September\n30, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n78\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

EPS for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were based on 10.8 million and 10.7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively.\n\n__Direct Written Premiums,_ _1_ _Net Written Premiums_ _1_ _and Net Premiums Earned_ _\n\nDirect written premiums 1 for the second quarter of 2023 were $47.6 million, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 4.3%, from $49.8 million in the prior year period. Most of the decrease was in Personal Lines, which decreased $2.8 million, or 5.9%.\n\nNet written premiums 1 decreased $1.4 million, or 4.8%, to $28.6 million during the three-month period ended June 30, 2023 from $30.0 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily in Personal Lines, which decreased $2.1 million, or 7.7%.\n\nNet premiums earned for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 increased 5.8% to $29.5 million, compared to $27.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The $1.6 million increase was primarily attributable to an increase in Personal Lines of $0.9 million and Livery Physical Damage of $0.7 million.\n\n__Net Loss Ratio_ _:\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company's net loss ratio was 66.4%, compared to 66.9% in the prior year period.\n\nWhile the underlying loss ratio (i.e., net loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophes and prior year loss development) was improved for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2022, the catastrophe loss had a bigger impact for the 2023 period.\n\nThere were three wind events classified as catastrophes for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The total net catastrophe losses for the calendar quarter were $1.4 million, which contributed 4.7 points to the net loss ratio. This compares to a 0.4-point impact from catastrophe events for the three months ended June 30, 2022.\n\nThe underlying loss ratio was 61.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.8 points from the 65.5% underlying loss ratio recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2022. The loss experience for the 2023 period was improved due to lower frequency, which is believed to be the result of the Company's new Select products as well as the Company's active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Such improvement in loss experience was offset by an elevated number of large losses, similar to what was observed in the first three months of 2023.\n\nPrior year development was stable for the three months ended June 30, 2023. There was an overall favorable development of $16,000, which had a marginal impact on the net loss ratio.\n\n1 These measures are not based on GAAP and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n__Net Underwriting Expense Ratio_ _:\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the net underwriting expense ratio was 32.5% as compared to 36.4% in the prior year period, a decrease of 3.9 percentage points. The decrease in the quarter was primarily attributable to a reduction in commission and underwriting expenses as a percentage of net earned premium.\n\n**_Balance Sheet / Investment Portfolio_ **\n\nKingstone's cash and investment holdings were $175.4 million at June 30, 2023 compared to $193.8 million at June 30, 2022. The Company's investment holdings are comprised primarily of investment grade corporate, mortgage-backed and municipal securities, with fixed income investments representing approximately 89.0% of total investments at June 30, 2023 and 82.7% at June 30, 2022. The Company's effective duration on its fixed-income portfolio is 4.6 years.\n\nNet investment income increased to $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2023 from $0.6 million in the prior year period. Last year's net investment income was understated due to the reversal of a prior year accrued interest income error in third party investment reporting. Higher interest rates on cash balances also factored into the increase.\n\n_Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss (AOCI), net of tax_\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, AOCI was a loss of $(14.9) million compared to a loss of $(12.0) million at June 30, 2022. The decrease in AOCI at June 30, 2023 of $2.9 million as compared to June 30, 2022 is attributable to the increase in interest rates most notably occurring in Q1 and Q2 2022.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Program_ **\n\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.\n\n**_Book Value_ **\n\nThe Company's book value per share at June 30, 2023 was $2.98, a decline of 32.6% compared to $4.42 at June 30, 2022.\n\n**30-Jun-23** |  **31-Mar-23** |  **31-Dec-22** |  **30-Sep-22** |  **30-Jun-22**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nBook Value Per Share |  **$** |  **2.98** |  **$** |  **3.09** |  **$** |  **3.38** |  **$** |  **3.65** |  **$** |  **4.42**  \n% Increase from specified period to 6/30/23 | -3.6% | -11.8% | -18.4% | -32.6%  \n  \n**FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT[WWW.KINGSTONECOMPANIES.COM](http://WWW.KINGSTONECOMPANIES.COM).**\n\n**_Conference Call Details_ **\n\nManagement will discuss the Company's operations and financial results in a conference call on Friday, August 11, 2022, at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThe dial-in numbers are:(877) 407-3105 (U.S.)(201) 493-6794 (International)\n\n**_Accompanying Webcast_ **\n\nThe call will be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the Kingstone website or by clicking on the conference call link:\n\n[Kingstone Companies Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Webcast](https://pr.report/axbGSqO8)\n\nThe webcast will be archived and accessible for approximately 30 days.\n\n**_Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures_ **\n\n**_Direct written premiums_ **represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period. **_Net premiums written_** are direct written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct written premiums and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company's policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct written premiums and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results.\n\n**_Net operating income (loss)_ **- is net income (loss) exclusive of realized investment gains (losses), net of tax. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to net operating income (loss).\n\nManagement uses net operating income (loss) along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including realized investment gains (losses), and may vary significantly between periods. Net operating income (loss) is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.\n\n**_Operating EBITDA_ **- is net income (loss) exclusive of interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and realized investment gains (losses). Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to operating EBITDA.\n\nManagement uses operating EBITDA along with other measures to gauge the Company's performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, and realized investment gains (losses), and may vary significantly between periods. Operating EBITDA is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company's overall profitability.\n\n**_Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income_ **- is book value per share excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income or AOCI. Management uses book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to evaluate the results to exclude the impact of interest rate changes on our fixed income portfolio.\n\n**_Net combined ratio excluding effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development_ **- is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development on the net combined ratio.\n\nWe believe that these ratios are useful to investors and they are used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year loss development. Catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude, and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio and net combined ratio. Prior year loss development can cause our loss ratio to vary significantly between periods and separating this information allows us to better compare the results for the current accident period over time. We believe these measures are useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance. We also provide them to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net combined ratio. The net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development should not be considered a substitute for the net combined ratio and does not reflect the Company's net combined ratio.\n\n**The table below reconciles direct written premiums and net written premiums to net premiums earned for the periods presented:**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended** |  **For the Six

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. For more details on factors that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A (\"Risk Factors\") of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part I, Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following:\n\n  * As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\n  * Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n  * We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\n  * The insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\n  * Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\n  * Because a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\n  * We are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\n  * Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n  * We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\n\n\nKingstone undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\n\nCONTACT:\n\n**_Kingstone Companies, Inc._ ** Jennifer GravelleChief Financial Officer(845) 768-1970\n\n**SOURCE:** Kingstone Companies, Inc.\n\nView source version on [accesswire.com](http://accesswire.com): <https://www.accesswire.com/773534/Kingstone-Announces-2023-Second-Quarter-Financial-Results>\n"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nKingstone Companies, Inc. (referred to herein as \"Kingstone\" or the “Company” or, on a standalone basis for the parent company only, the “Holding\nCompany”), through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”), underwrites property and casualty insurance exclusively through\nretail and wholesale agents and brokers. KICO is a licensed insurance company in the States of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,\nPennsylvania, Connecticut, Maine and New Hampshire. KICO is currently offering its property and casualty insurance products in New York, New Jersey,\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, 88.6% and 79.8%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written\npremiums came from the New York policies. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, 87.8% and 80.2%, respectively, of KICO’s direct written\npremiums came from the New York policies. Kingstone, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general\nagency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies it places with others and pays commissions to these agencies.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The principles for condensed interim financial information do not require the inclusion of all the information and footnotes required by\nGAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 31, 2023. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited\nby an independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) but, in\nthe opinion of management, such financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation\nof the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 may not be indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023.\nCertain prior year balances were reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassification had no effect on the Company’s previously\nreported financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 2 – Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, which include the reserves for losses and LAE,\nwhich are subject to estimation errors due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of\nmany years. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with receivables under reinsurance contracts related to contingent ceding commission revenue\nrequire judgments by management. On an ongoing basis, management reevaluates its assumptions and the methods for calculating these estimates. Actual\nresults may differ significantly from the estimates used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n10\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: (1) KICO and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries, CMIC Properties, Inc. (“Properties”) and 15 Joys Lane, LLC (“15 Joys Lane”), which together own the land and building from which KICO\noperates, and (2) Cosi. All significant inter-company account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This new guidance applies to reinsurance and insurance receivables and other\nfinancing receivables. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities carried at fair value, estimated credit losses will continue to be measured at the present\nvalue of expected cash flows; however, the other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) concept has been eliminated. Under the previous guidance, estimated\ncredit impairments resulted in a write-down of amortized cost. Under the new guidance, estimated credit losses are recognized through an allowance and\nreversals of the allowance are permitted if the estimate of credit losses declines. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where the Company has an\nintent to sell, impairment will continue to result in a write-down of amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was effective for the Company on January 1, 2023. The\nCompany determined as of the date of adoption that the updated guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Below is a summary\nof the significant accounting policies impacted by the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is reported as a reduction of a financial asset’s cost basis and is measured on a pool basis when\nsimilar risk characteristics exist. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Historical\ncredit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and adjustments may be made to reflect current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for any additional factors that come to the Company’s attention. This could\ninclude significant shifts in counterparty financial strength ratings, aging of past due receivables, amounts sent to collection agencies, or other underlying\nportfolio changes. Amounts are considered past due when payments have not been received according to contractual terms. The Company also considers\ncurrent and forecasted economic conditions, using a variety of economic metrics and forecast indices. The sensitivity of expected credit losses relative to\nchanges to these forecasted economic conditions can vary by financial asset class. The Company considers a reasonable and supportable forecast period to be\nup to 24 months from the balance sheet date. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical credit experience. The Company uses collateral\narrangements such as letters of credit and amounts held in beneficiary trusts to mitigate credit risk, which are considered in the estimate of net amount expected\nto be collected.\nThe Company has made a policy election to present accrued interest balances separately from the amortized cost basis of assets and has elected the practical\nexpedient to exclude the accrued interest from the tabular disclosures for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities. The Company has elected not to\nestimate an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. The accrual of interest income is discontinued and the asset is placed on nonaccrual\nstatus in the quarter that payment becomes delinquent.

The allowance for credit loss related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected and the amortized cost basis, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The Company considers all available\nevidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded. Changes in the allowance are presented as a\ncomponent of net gains (losses) on investments on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were 146 and 155 fixed-maturity securities, respectively, that accounted for the gross unrealized losses. The\nCompany determined that none of the unrealized losses were deemed to be credit losses for its portfolio of investments for the six months ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022. Significant factors influencing the Company’s determination that unrealized losses were temporary included credit quality considerations, the\nmagnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and interest rate environment factors, and management’s\nintent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery of estimated fair value to the Company’s cost basis.\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at June 30, 2023 as follows:\nJune 30, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ 5,927,580 $ (59,420) 1 $ - - - $ 5,927,580 $ (59,420)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 148,703 (2,652) 1 13,448,464 3,489,849) 13 13,597,167 (3,492,501)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 6,860,908 (270,230) 12 64,548,129 (7,511,387) 77 71,409,037 (7,781,617)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 101,701 (1,621) 4 41,865,274 (7,592,927) 38 41,966,975 (7,594,548)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $13,038,892 $ (333,923) 18 $119,861,867 $(18,594,163) 128 $132,900,759 $(18,928,086)\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe Company held available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses representing declines that were considered temporary at December 31, 2022 as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $18,918,196 $ (6,928) 3 $ - - - $ 18,918,196 $ (6,928)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 7,970,633 (2,195,273) 9 5,170,753 (1,771,494) 5 13,141,386 (3,966,767)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 56,910,104 (5,796,994) 75 15,172,381 (2,458,985) 15 72,082,485 (8,255,979)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 10,145,880 882,664) 22 34,753,178 (7,150,803) 26 44,899,058 (8,033,467)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $93,944,813 $(8,881,859) 109 $55,096,312 $(11,381,282) 46 $149,041,125 $(20,263,141)\n18\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s investments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022 indicating the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\nJune 30, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 8,133,547 $ - $ - $ 8,133,547\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,597,167 - 13,597,167\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 71,409,037 - - 71,409,037\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 44,715,366 - 44,715,366\nTotal fixed maturities 79,542,584 58,312,533 - 137,855,117\nEquity securities 14,410,482 - - 14,410,482\nTotal investments $ 93,953,066 $ 58,312,533 $ - $ 152,265,599\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nFixed-maturity securities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government corporations and\nagencies $ 23,869,096 $ - $ - $ 23,869,096\nPolitical subdivisions of States, Territories and Possessions - 13,141,387 - 13,141,387\nCorporate and other bonds industrial and miscellaneous 71,585,115 497,370 - 72,082,485\nResidential mortgage and other asset backed securities - 45,622,195 - 45,622,195\nTotal fixed maturities 95,454,211 59,260,952 - 154,715,163\nEquity securities 13,834,390 - - 13,834,390\nTotal investments $ 109,288,601 $ 59,260,952 $ - $ 168,549,553\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s investment in a hedge fund measured at Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share as of June 30, 2023 and December\n31, 2022.

Prior year loss and LAE development incurred\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $19,253 favorable and $270,401 unfavorable, respectively. Management, on a quarterly basis,\nperforms a review of open liability claims to assess carried case and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserve levels, giving consideration to both Company\nand industry trends.\nLoss and LAE Reserves\nThe reserving process for loss and LAE reserves provides for the Company’s best estimate at a particular point in time of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses\nand LAE incurred, including settlement and administration of losses, and is based on facts and circumstances then known including losses that have occurred\nbut that have not yet been reported. The process relies on standard actuarial reserving methodologies, judgments relative to estimates of ultimate claim severity\nand frequency, the length of time before losses will develop to their ultimate level (‘tail’ factors), and the likelihood of changes in the law or other external\nfactors that are beyond the Company’s control. Several actuarial reserving methodologies are used to estimate required loss reserves. The process produces\ncarried reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate and is the cumulative combination of the best estimates made by line of business,\naccident year, and loss and LAE. The amount of loss and LAE reserves for individual reported claims (the “case reserve”) is determined by the claims\ndepartment and changes over time as new information is gathered. Such information is critical to the review of appropriate IBNR reserves and includes a\nreview of coverage applicability, comparative liability on the part of the insured, injury severity, property damage, replacement cost estimates, and any other\ninformation considered pertinent to estimating the exposure presented by the claim. The amounts of loss and LAE reserves for unreported claims and\ndevelopment on known claims (IBNR reserves) are determined using historical information aggregated by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions.\nSince this process produces loss reserves set by management based upon the actuaries’ best estimate, there is no explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in\nthe carried loss reserves.\n22\nTable of Contents\nDue to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process, the ultimate liability may differ, perhaps substantially, from the original estimate. Such\nestimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period’s results. Reserves are closely monitored and are\nrecomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company\nreviews by line of business existing reserves, new claims, changes to existing case reserves, and paid losses with respect to the current and prior periods.\nSeveral methods are used, varying by line of business and accident year, in order to select the estimated period-end loss reserves. These methods include the\nfollowing:\nPaid Loss Development – historical patterns of paid loss development are used to project future paid loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nIncurred Loss Development – historical patterns of incurred loss development, reflecting both paid losses and changes in case reserves, are used to project\nfuture incurred loss emergence in order to estimate required reserves.\nPaid Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) – an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been paid, based on historical paid loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining unpaid\nportion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for situations where\nan unusually high or low amount of paid losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncurred Bornhuetter-Ferguson (“BF”) - an estimated loss ratio for a particular accident year is determined, and is weighted against the portion of the accident\nyear claims that have been reported, based on historical incurred loss development patterns. The estimate of required reserves assumes that the remaining\nunreported portion of a particular accident year will pay out at a rate consistent with the estimated loss ratio for that year. This method can be useful for\nsituations where an unusually high or low amount of reported losses exists at the early stages of the claims development process.\nIncremental Claim-Based Methods – historical patterns of incremental incurred losses and paid LAE during various stages of development are reviewed and\nassumptions are made regarding average loss and LAE development applied to remaining claims inventory. Such methods more properly reflect changes in the\nspeed of claims closure and the relative adequacy of case reserve levels at various stages of development. These methods may provide a more accurate\nestimate of IBNR for lines of business with relatively few remaining open claims but for which significant recent settlement activity has occurred.\nFrequency / Severity Based Methods – historical measurements of claim frequency and average paid claim size (severity) are reviewed for more mature\naccident years where a majority of claims have been reported and/or closed. These historical averages are trended forward to more recent periods in order to\nestimate ultimate losses for newer accident years that are not yet fully developed. These methods are useful for lines of business with slow and/or volatile loss\ndevelopment patterns, such as liability lines where information pertaining to individual cases may not be completely known for many years. The claim\nfrequency and severity information for older periods can then be used as reasonable measures for developing a range of estimates for more recent immature\nperiods.\n23\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s best estimate of required reserves is generally based on an average of the methods above, with appropriate weighting of methods based on the\nline of business and accident year being projected. In some cases, additional methods or historical data from industry sources are employed to supplement the\nprojections derived from the methods listed above.\nThree key assumptions that materially affect the estimate of loss reserves are the loss ratio estimate for the current accident year used in the BF methods, the\nloss development factor selections used in the loss development methods, and the loss severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method described\nabove. The loss ratio estimates used in the BF methods are selected after reviewing historical accident year loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, trend, and mix\nof business. The severity assumptions used in the frequency / severity method are determined by reviewing historical average claim severity for older more\nmature accident periods, trended forward to less mature accident periods.\nThe Company reviews the carried reserves levels on a regular basis as additional information becomes available and makes adjustments in the periods in which\nsuch adjustments are determined to be necessary. The Company is not aware of any claim trends that have emerged or that would cause future adverse\ndevelopment that have not already been contemplated in setting current carried reserves levels.\nIn New York State, lawsuits for negligence are subject to certain limitations and must be commenced within three years from the date of the accident or are\notherwise barred. Accordingly, the Company’s exposure to unreported claims (“pure” IBNR) for accident dates of June 30, 2020 and prior is limited, although\nthere remains the possibility of adverse development on reported claims (“case development” IBNR). In certain rare circumstances states have retroactively\nrevised a statute of limitations. The Company is not aware of any such effort that would have a material impact on the Company’s results.\nThe following is information about incurred and paid claims development as of June 30, 2023, net of reinsurance, as well as the cumulative reported claims by\naccident year and total IBNR reserves as of June 30, 2023 included in the net incurred loss and allocated expense amounts.

The reinsurance program also provides income as a result\nof ceding commissions earned pursuant to the quota share reinsurance contracts. The Company’s participation in reinsurance arrangements does not relieve the\nCompany of its obligations to policyholders.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe Company earned ceding commission revenue under the 2023/2024 Treaty for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, and under the\n2021/2023 Treaty for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, based on a fixed provisional commission rate at which provisional ceding\ncommissions are earned. The Company earned ceding commission revenue under its expired quota share reinsurance agreements based on: (i) a fixed\nprovisional commission rate at which provisional ceding commissions were earned, and (ii) a continuing sliding scale of commission rates and ultimate treaty\nyear loss ratios on the policies reinsured under each of these agreements based upon which contingent ceding commissions are earned. The sliding scale\nincludes minimum and maximum commission rates in relation to specified ultimate loss ratios. The commission rate and contingent ceding commissions\nearned increase when the estimated ultimate loss ratio decreases and, conversely, the commission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned decrease\nwhen the estimated ultimate loss ratio increases.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCeding commission revenue consists of the following:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 5,294,025 $ 4,692,931 $ 10,740,833 $ 9,234,464\nContingent ceding commissions earned 118,185 22,656 116,784 162,519\n$ 5,412,210 $ 4,715,587 $ 10,857,617 $ 9,396,983\nProvisional ceding commissions are settled monthly. Balances due from reinsurers for contingent ceding commissions on quota share treaties are settled\nperiodically based on the Loss Ratio of each treaty year that ends on June 30, for the expired treaties that were subject to contingent commissions. As discussed\nabove, the Loss Ratios from prior years’ treaties are subject to change as incurred losses from those periods develop, resulting in an increase or decrease in the\ncommission rate and contingent ceding commissions earned. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net contingent ceding commissions payable to\nreinsurers under all treaties was approximately $2,551,000 and $2,667,000, respectively, which is recorded in reinsurance balances payable on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nExpected Credit Losses – Uncollectible Reinsurance\nThe Company reviews reinsurance receivables which relate to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed\nwhen losses are paid in the future. The Company has not recorded an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal\ncredit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major\nrating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of other underwriting expenses on the condensed consolidated statements of operations\nand comprehensive income (loss).\nNote 7 – Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank\nIn July 2017, KICO became a member of, and invested in, the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”). KICO is required to maintain an\ninvestment in capital stock of FHLBNY. Based on redemption provisions of FHLBNY, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. At its\ndiscretion, FHLBNY may declare dividends on the stock. Management reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the\nstock. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, no impairment has been recognized. FHLBNY members have access to a variety of flexible, low cost funding\nthrough FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances, which are to be fully collateralized. Eligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY\nincludes residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See Note 3 – Investments for eligible\ncollateral held in a designated custodian account available for future advances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the previous\nquarter and are due and payable within one year of borrowing. KICO is currently able to borrow on an overnight basis. If KICO has collateral, based on\nKICO’s net admitted assets, the maximum allowable advance as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately $13,268,000 and $13,192,000,\nrespectively. Available collateral as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was approximately $11,799,000 and $12,228,000, respectively. Advances are\nlimited to 85% of the amount of available collateral. There were no borrowings under this facility during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\n29\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nDebt as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 consists of the following:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\n2022 Notes, net $ 17,832,408 $ 17,252,868\nEquipment financing 7,369,418 7,905,655\nBalance at end of period $ 25,201,826 $ 25,158,523\nNote and Warrant Exchange\nOn December 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with several holders (the “Exchanging\nNoteholders”) of the Company’s outstanding 5.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2017 Notes”). On the date of the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging\nNoteholders held 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $21,545,000 of the $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes then\noutstanding. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, on December 15, 2022, the Exchanging Noteholders exchanged their respective 2017 Notes for the\nfollowing: (i) new 12.0% Senior Notes due December 30, 2024 of the Company in the aggregate approximate principal amount of $19,950,000 (the “2022\nNotes”); (ii) cash in the aggregate approximate amount of $1,595,000, together with accrued interest on the 2017 Notes; and (iii) three-year warrants for the\npurchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock of the Company, exercisable at an exercise price of $1.00 per share (the “Warrants”). The\nremaining $8,455,000 principal amount of the 2017 Notes, together with accrued interest thereon, was paid on the maturity date of the 2017 Notes of December\n30, 2022.\n2022 Notes\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company issued $19,950,000 of its 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears\non June 30 and December 30 of each year, which will begin on June 30, 2023 at the rate of 12.0% per annum. Warrants were issued with a fair value of\n$993,200 (see Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity) and transaction costs were $1,758,112, for an effective yield of 13.92% per annum. The balance of the 2022\nNotes as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\n12.0% Senior Unsecured Notes $ 19,950,000 $ 19,950,000\nWarrants (816,403) (979,684)\nIssuance costs (1,301,189) (1,717,448)\n2022 Notes, net $ 17,832,408 $ 17,252,868\nThe Company is required to make a mandatory redemption of the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023, in an amount such that the aggregate principal amount of\nthe 2022 Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be equal to the amount by which the maximum Ordinary Dividend Paying\nCapacity of KICO (as defined below) measured as of December 15, 2023 exceeds the Company’s Holding Company Expenses (as defined below) for the\ncalendar year ended December 31, 2023. “Ordinary Dividend Paying Capacity” means the sum, as measured on December 15, 2023, of (i) the maximum\nallowable amount of dividends that KICO is permitted to pay without seeking any regulatory approval in accordance with New York insurance regulations\nbased on its statutory annual and quarterly financial statements filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as of and for the thirty-six (36)\nmonth period ended September 30, 2023 plus (ii) any dividends paid by KICO to the Company during the period beginning January 1, 2023 and ending\nSeptember 30, 2023. “Holding Company Expenses” means the sum of (i) cash interest expense paid or to be paid during the calendar year ended December 31,\n2023 on the 2022 Notes, intercompany loans and any other indebtedness of the holding company on a stand-alone basis and (ii) other cash operating expenses,\nincluding taxes, paid or to be paid by the holding company during the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. The amount of other operating expenses paid in\ncash in the preceding clause (ii) shall not exceed $2.5 million. Holding Company Expenses will be determined based on the actual Holding Company Expenses\nfor the nine months ending September 30, 2023, and an estimate of Holding Company Expenses for the three months ending December 30, 2023.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe 2022 Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not the obligations of or guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes\nrank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated or junior in right of\npayment to the 2022 Notes. The Notes rank equally in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness, but are effectively\nsubordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such secured indebtedness. In addition, the 2022 Notes are\nstructurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe 2022 Notes are redeemable, at the Company’s option, in whole or in part, at any time or in part from time to time, upon not less than fifteen (15) nor more\nthan sixty (60) days’ notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof) if redeemed during the respective\nperiod set forth below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant\nrecord date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date):\nPeriod: Percentage\nDecember 30, 2022 to December 29, 2023 102.00%\nDecember 30, 2023 to September 29, 2024 101.00%\nSeptember 30, 2024 to December 29, 2024 100.00%\nAs of the end of each calendar quarter, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2022, the Company is subject to a leverage maintenance\ntest (“Leverage Maintenance Test”), which requires that the Total Consolidated Indebtedness (as defined below) of the Company not be greater than 30% of\nTotal Consolidated Capitalization (as defined below). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the ratio as defined under the Leverage Maintenance Test\nwas 29.8% and 26.7%, respectively. “Total Consolidated Indebtedness” is the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any Indebtedness\nissued with more than de minimis original issue discount) of all outstanding long-term of the Company except for the sale leaseback transaction described\nbelow under “Equipment Financing”, any refinancing or any future sale leaseback transaction. “Total Consolidated Capitalization” is the amount equal to the\nsum of (x) Total Consolidated Indebtedness outstanding as of such date and (y) the total consolidated shareholders’ equity of the Company, excluding\naccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, as recorded on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet.\n31\nTable of Contents\nEquipment Financing\nOn October 27, 2022, KICO entered into a sale leaseback transaction, whereby KICO sold $8,096,824 of fixed assets to a bank. Under GAAP, the sale\nleaseback transaction is recorded as equipment financing (“Financing”). The provisions of the Financing require KICO to pay a monthly payment of principal\nand interest at the rate of 5.86% per annum totaling $126,877 for a term of 60 months, which commenced on October 27, 2022. The terms of the Financing\nprovide buyout options to KICO at the end of the 60 month term, which are as follows:\n· At the end of the lease, KICO may purchase the fixed assets for a purchase price of $2,024,206, which is 25% of the original fixed asset cost of\n$8,096,824; or\n· KICO may renew the lease for 16 months at the same rental rate, which totals $2,030,036.\nA provision of the Financing requires KICO to pledge collateral for the lease obligation. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the amount of required\ncollateral was approximately $7,845,000 and $8,691,000, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of KICO’s pledged collateral\nwas approximately $8,134,000 and $8,691,000, respectively, in United States Treasury securities.\nFuture contractual payment obligations under the Financing as of June 30, 2023 are as follows:\nFor the Year\nEnding\nDecember 31, Total\nRemainder of 2023 $ 552,135\n2024 1,153,862\n2025 1,223,293\n2026 1,296,901\n2027 1,119,021\n5,345,212\n2027 purchase price 2,024,206\nTotal $ 7,369,418\nNote 8 – Stockholders’ Equity\nDividends Declared and Paid\nDividends declared and paid on Common Stock were $-0- and $851,266 for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On November 11,\n2022, the Company’s Board of Directors determined to suspend regular quarterly dividends. Future dividend policy will be subject to the discretion of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors.\n2014 Equity Participation Plan\nEffective August 12, 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Participation Plan (the “2014 Plan”) pursuant to which a maximum of 700,000 shares of\nCommon Stock of the Company were initially authorized to be issued pursuant to the grant of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock\nappreciation rights, restricted stock and stock bonuses. Incentive stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant\n(except no later than five years for a grant to a 10% stockholder). Non-statutory stock options granted under the 2014 Plan expire no later than ten years from\nthe date of grant. The Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee determines the vesting provisions for stock awards granted under the 2014 Plan,\nsubject to the provisions of the 2014 Plan. On August 5, 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the 2014 Plan, including an increase in\nthe maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are authorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,400,000. On August 9, 2023,\nthe Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock of the Company that are\nauthorized to be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan to 1,900,000 (see Note 13 – Subsequent Events).\n32\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nThe results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include stock-based compensation expense for stock options totaling\napproximately $-0- and $2,000, respectively. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include stock-based compensation\nexpense for stock options totaling approximately $-0- and $8,000, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the six months\nended June 30, 2022 is net of estimated forfeitures of approximately 18%. Such amounts have been included in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and comprehensive income (loss) within other operating expenses.\nNo options were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. The fair value of stock options at the grant date are estimated using the Black-\nScholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option - pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no\nvesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected\nstock price volatility. Because the Company’s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the\nsubjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable\nsingle measure of the fair value of the Company’s stock options.\nA summary of stock option activity under the Company’s 2014 Plan for the six months ended June 30, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nExercise Remaining Aggregate\nNumber of Price per Contractual Intrinsic\nStock Options Shares Share Term Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.92 $ -\nGranted - $ - - $ -\nExercised - $ - - $ -\nExpired/Forfeited - $ - - $ -\nOutstanding at June 30, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.40 $ -\nVested and Exercisable at June 30, 2023 107,201 $ 8.31 1.40 $ -\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and options exercisable at June 30, 2023 is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the\nunderlying options and the market price of the Company’s Common Stock for the options that had exercise prices that were lower than the $1.17 closing price\nof the Company’s Common Stock on June 30, 2023. No options were exercised, forfeited or expired during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The total\nintrinsic value of options when forfeited are determined as of the date of forfeiture. The total intrinsic value of options when expired are determined as of the\ndate of expiration.\nParticipants in the 2014 Plan may exercise their outstanding vested options, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise\nissuable by a number of shares having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised, or by exchanging a number of shares owned\nfor a period of greater than one year having a fair market value equal to the exercise price of the option being exercised.\n33\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were no unvested options.\nAs of June 30, 2023, there were 85,778 shares reserved for grants under the 2014 Plan.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nA summary of the restricted Common Stock activity under the 2014 Plan for six months ended June 30, 2023 is as follows:\nWeighted\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nValue Aggregate\nRestricted Stock Awards Shares per Share Fair Value\nBalance at January 1, 2023 366,597 $ 6.97 $ 2,555,181\nGranted 272,682 $ 1.37 $ 373,499\nVested (56,977) $ 6.67 $ (380,199)\nForfeited (7,015) $ 5.02 $ (35,214)\nBalance at June 30, 2023 575,287 $ 3.83 $ 2,203,349\nFair value was calculated using the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the grant date. For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nstock-based compensation for these grants was approximately $212,000 and $479,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, stock-\nbased compensation for these grants was approximately $429,000 and $998,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). These amounts reflect the Company’s accounting expense\nand do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the directors, executives and employees.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn June 19, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the Kingstone Companies, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), subject to\nstockholder approval. Such approval was obtained on August 10, 2021. The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company with an\nopportunity to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be\npurchased under the ESPP is 750,000, subject to adjustment as provided for in the ESPP. The ESPP was effective August 10, 2021 and expires on August 10,\n2031. A maximum of 5,000 shares of Common Stock may be purchased by an employee during any offering period.\nThe initial offering period under the ESPP was from November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2022 (“2021/2022 Offering”). There is currently no offering\npursuant to the ESPP subsequent to October 31, 2022. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2022, stock-based compensation under the\n2021/2022 Offering was approximately $5,000 and 11,000, respectively, which is included in other operating expenses on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nAt the end of the 2021/2022 Offering period, 33,222 shares of Common Stock were issued at $1.82 per share to participating employees for a total purchase\nprice of $60,464.\nWarrants\nIn connection with the Exchange Agreement (see Note 7 – Debt – “Note and Warrant Exchange”), as additional consideration, on December 15, 2022, the\nCompany issued warrants to the Exchanging Noteholders to purchase 969,525 shares of Common Stock. The fair value of the warrants, using the Black-\nScholes valuation formula, was $993,200, which has been capitalized as a deferred financing cost of the 2022 Notes. The fair value of the warrants is being\namortized over the life of the warrants, which is 36.5 months.\nThe warrants are exercisable through December 30, 2025 at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. Holders of the warrants may exercise their outstanding\nwarrants in cash, or, in whole or in part, by having the Company reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable by a number of shares having a fair market\nvalue equal to the exercise price of the warrants being exercised.\nAs of June 30, 2023, all warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of 969,525 shares of Common Stock were outstanding.\nNo warrants were granted during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 9 – Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes all wholly-owned subsidiaries. State tax returns are filed on a consolidated or\nseparate return basis depending on applicable laws. The Company records adjustments related to prior years’ taxes during the period when they are identified,\ngenerally when the tax returns are filed. The effect of these adjustments on the current and prior periods (during which the differences originated) is evaluated\nbased upon quantitative and qualitative factors and are considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for the respective\nperiods.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates applicable to the period the temporary differences are expected to be recovered.\nAccordingly, the current period income tax provision can be affected by the enactment of new tax rates. The net deferred income taxes on the balance sheets\nreflect temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes, tax effected at\nvarious rates depending on whether the temporary differences are subject to federal taxes, state taxes, or both.\n34\nTable of Contents\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax asset:\nNet operating loss carryovers (1) $ 5,108,128 $ 3,828,947\nClaims reserve discount 1,189,834 1,238,544\nUnearned premium 3,510,180 3,574,840\nDeferred ceding commission revenue 2,034,934 2,230,109\nNet unrealized losses on securities 4,191,215 4,920,837\nOther 794,410 503,692\nTotal deferred tax assets 16,828,701 16,296,969\nDeferred tax liability:\nInvestment in KICO (2) 759,543 759,543\nDeferred acquisition costs 4,502,433 5,002,085\nIntangibles 105,000 105,000\nDepreciation and amortization 123,249 99,183\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 5,490,225 5,965,811\nNet deferred income tax asset $ 11,338,476 $ 10,331,158\n(1) The deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryovers (“NOL”) are as follows:\nJune 30, December 31,\nType of NOL 2023 2022 Expiration\nFederal only, NOL from 2021 - 2023 $ 5,108,128 $ 3,828,947 None\nState only (A) 2,479,077 2,276,595 December 2027 - December 2043\nValuation allowance (2,479,077) (2,276,595)\nState only, net of valuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax asset from net operating loss carryovers $ 5,108,128 $ 3,828,947\n(A) Kingstone generates operating losses for state purposes and has prior year NOLs available. The state NOL as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was\napproximately $38,140,000 and $35,025,000, respectively. KICO, the Company’s insurance underwriting subsidiary, is not subject to state income taxes.\nKICO’s state tax obligations are paid through a gross premiums tax, which is included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income (loss) within other underwriting expenses. Kingstone has recorded a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of generating enough\nstate taxable income to utilize 100% of the available state NOLs over their remaining lives, which expire between 2027 and 2043.\n35\nTable of Contents\n(2) Deferred tax liability – Investment in KICO\nOn July 1, 2009, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of KICO (formerly known as Commercial\nMutual Insurance Company (“CMIC”)) pursuant to the conversion of CMIC from an advance premium cooperative to a stock property and casualty insurance\ncompany. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, the Company acquired a 100% equity interest in KICO, in consideration for the exchange of $3,750,000 principal\namount of surplus notes of CMIC. In addition, the Company forgave all accrued and unpaid interest on the surplus notes as of the date of conversion. As of the\ndate of acquisition, unpaid accrued interest on the surplus notes along with the accretion of the discount on the original purchase of the surplus notes totaled\n$2,921,319 (together “Untaxed Interest”). As of the date of acquisition, the deferred tax liability on the Untaxed Interest was $1,169,000. A temporary\ndifference with an indefinite life exists when the parent has a lower carrying value of its subsidiary for income tax purposes. The deferred tax liability was\nreduced to $759,543 upon the reduction of federal income tax rates as of December 31, 2017. The Company is required to maintain its deferred tax liability of\n$759,543 related to this temporary difference until the stock of KICO is sold, or the assets of KICO are sold or KICO and the parent are merged.\nIn assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. No valuation allowance against deferred tax assets has been established, except for NOL limitations, as the Company\nbelieves it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized based on the historical taxable income of KICO, or by offset to deferred tax liabilities.\nThe Company had no material unrecognized tax benefit and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. There were no interest or penalties related\nto income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. If any had been recognized these would have\nbeen reported in income tax expense.\nGenerally, taxing authorities may examine the Company’s tax returns for the three years from the date of filing. The Company’s tax returns for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 through December 31, 2021 remain subject to examination.\nNote 10 – Loss Per Common Share\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Diluted loss per\ncommon share reflects, in periods in which it has a dilutive effect, the impact of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants as well as\nnon-vested restricted stock awards. The computation of diluted loss per common share excludes those options and warrants with an exercise price in excess of\nthe average market price of the Company’s Common Stock during the periods presented.\nThe computation of diluted loss per common share excludes outstanding options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards in periods where the exercise\nof such options and warrants or vesting of such restricted stock awards would be anti-dilutive. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023 and\n2022, no options, warrants or restricted stock awards were included in the computation of diluted loss per common share as they would have been anti-dilutive\nfor the relevant periods and, as a result, the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of diluted loss per common share has\nnot been adjusted for the effect of such options, warrants and non-vested restricted stock awards.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock used in the calculation of basic and diluted loss per common share follows:\nThree months ended Six months ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding 10,755,848 10,644,578 10,753,974 10,637,553\nEffect of dilutive securities, common share equivalents:\nStock options - - - -\nWarrants - - - -\nRestricted stock awards - - - -\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding, used for computing diluted loss\nper share 10,755,848 10,644,578 10,753,974 10,637,553\nNote 11 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, to the extent a claim is asserted by a\nthird party in a lawsuit against one of the Company’s insureds covered by a particular policy, the Company may have a duty to defend the insured party against\nthe claim. These claims may relate to bodily injury, property damage or other compensable injuries as set forth in the policy. Such proceedings are considered\nin estimating the liability for loss and LAE expenses.\nOffice Lease\nThe Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company (“KICO”). KICO’s insureds\nare located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, although we are writing business in New\nJersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts. We are licensed in the States of New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts,\nPennsylvania, Maine, and New Hampshire. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, 88.6% and 87.8% of KICO’s direct written\npremiums came from the New York policies.\nIn addition, our subsidiary, Cosi Agency, Inc. (“Cosi”), a multi-state licensed general agency, receives commission revenue from KICO for the policies\nit places with others and pays commissions to these agencies. Cosi retains the profit between the commission revenue received and the commission expense\npaid (“Net Cosi Revenue”). Commission expense is reduced by Net Cosi Revenue. Cosi-related operating expenses are minimal and are included in other\noperating expenses. Cosi-related operating expenses are not included in our stand-alone insurance underwriting business and, accordingly, Cosi’s expenses are\nnot included in the calculation of our combined ratio as described below.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share\nreinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO’s insurance policies\nare written for a one-year term. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that\ninsurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one-year life of the policy). A significant period of time can elapse from the receipt of insurance premiums\nto the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized\ninvestment gains and losses on investments. Our holding company earns investment income from its cash holdings.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of\ntheir total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”)\nare incurred such as insurance adjusters’ fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs\ninclude commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees’ compensation and\nbenefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These corporate expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive\nemployment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, cooperative/condominium, renters, and\npersonal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: Through July 2019, we offered businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office\nrisks, with limited property exposures. We also wrote artisan’s liability policies for small independent contractors with smaller sized workforces. In addition,\nwe wrote special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners risks, including those with limited residential exposures. Further, we\noffered commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIn May 2019, due to the poor performance of this line we placed a moratorium on new commercial lines and new commercial umbrella submissions\nwhile we further reviewed this business. In July 2019, due to the continuing poor performance of these lines, we made the decision to no longer underwrite\ncommercial lines or commercial umbrella risks. In-force policies as of July 31, 2019 for these lines were non-renewed at the end of their annual terms. As of\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no commercial liability policies in-force. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, these expired policies\nrepresent approximately 16.3% and 17.9%, respectively, of loss and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables. See discussion below under “Additional\nFinancial Information”.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies\ninsure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company’s business. Expressed as a percentage, this is\nthe ratio of net losses and LAE incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s operational efficiency in administering\nits business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other\nunderwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company’s overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and\nnet underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income,\nand may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It\nexcludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in\ncombined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company’s overall operating profitability before items such as investment income,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, and other\nfactors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the condensed consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to\nmateriality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating its estimates in these financial statements may not\nmaterialize. Application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result,\nactual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of\noperations to those of similar companies. See the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section within Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 for further information.\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been\nreported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred income taxes, allowance for credit losses of investment securities,\nand the valuation of warrants. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022\nand Note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for accounting policies regarding the adoption of ASU 2016-13\neffective January 1, 2023.\nKingstone 2.0 (completed) and Kingstone 3.0 (underway)\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, a series of strategic initiatives, coined “Kingstone 2.0” were commenced to modernize our Company. The pillars of\nthe new strategy were as follows:\n1. Strengthen the management team by adding highly qualified professionals with deep domain experience and diverse backgrounds;\n2. Reduce expenses and increase efficiency by embracing technology including converting to a new policy management system, retiring multiple\nlegacy systems and starting up a new claims system, among other technology initiatives;\n3. Develop and implement a new, more highly segmented product suite (Kingstone Select) which better matches rate to risk using advanced analytics\nand an abundance of data; and\n4. Better manage the Company’s catastrophe exposure in order to reduce loss cost and the growth rate of our Probable Maximum Loss (“PML”) in\norder to mitigate the impact of the emerging “hard market” in catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe announced the substantive completion of Kingstone 2.0 in late 2022 and embarked on a new strategy to optimize our in-force business, which we coined as\n“Kingstone 3.0”. The four pillars of this new strategy entail:\n1. Aggressively reducing the book of business in non-New York states, which has had a disproportionately negative impact on underwriting results,\nby slowing new business, re-underwriting the book, culling the agent base, reducing commissions, or other means, subject to regulatory\nconstraints;\n2. Adjusting pricing to stay ahead of loss trends, including inflation, by filing the maximum annual rate change that can be supported in each state\nand product and ensuring all policyholders are insured to value;\n3. Tightly managing reinsurance requirements and costs, using risk selection and other underwriting capabilities to manage the growth rate of our\nPML; and\n4.

PCS\ncatastrophe bulletins are issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders\nand insurers.\n46\nTable of Contents\nSix months ended June 30,\nPercentage\nPoint Percent\n2023 2022 Change Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 77.2% 76.2% 1.0 1.3%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 33.6% 37.4% (3.8) (10.2)%\nNet combined ratio 110.8% 113.6% (2.8) (2.5)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the six months ended June 30, 2023 (“Six Months 2023”) were $95,244,000 compared to $92,762,000 during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2022 (“Six Months 2022”). The increase of $2,482,000, or 2.7%, was primarily due to an increase in premiums from our personal lines\nbusiness.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Six Months 2023 were $88,182,000, an increase of $1,227,000, or 1.4%, from\n$86,955,000 in Six Months 2022. The 1.4% increase in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to rate increases offset by the decrease in\npremiums associated with a 8.6% decrease in policies in force as of June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022. The rate increases achieved along with a\ndecrease in policies in force is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Six Months 2023 were $7,016,000, an increase of $1,289,000, or 22.5%, from\n$5,727,000 in Six Months 2022. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an increase in\nthe values of the autos insured.\nBeginning in 2017, we started writing personal lines policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and\nConnecticut. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business outside of New York as our “non-New York” business. Direct written\npremiums from our Core business were $83,639,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $74,382,000 in Six Months 2022, an increase of $9,257,000, or 12.4%.\nPolicies in force from our Core business decreased by 1.6% in Six Months 2023 compared to Six Months 2022. Direct written premiums from our non-New\nYork business were $11,605,000 in Six Months 2023 down from $18,380,000 in Six Months 2022, a decrease of $6,775,000, or 36.9%. Policies in force from\nour non-New York business decreased by 27% in Six Months 2023 compared to Six Months 2022. The increase in our Core business and the decrease in our\nnon-New Yok business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-New York business due to profitability concerns.\n47\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31,\n2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Net written\npremiums decreased $2,393,000, or 4.4%, to $52,551,000 in Six Months 2023 from $54,944,000 in Six Months 2022. Net written premiums include direct\npremiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). In Six Months 2023, our\npremiums ceded under quota share treaties increased by $4,673,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Six Months 2022 (see table above). The increase in\nSix Months 2023 was attributable to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty. The remainder of the 2021/2023 Treaty was on a cutoff basis\nand the new 2023/2024 Treaty was placed for 30% on January 1, 2023. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty in Six Months 2023,\nand the 2021-2023 Treaty in Six Months 2022.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Six Months 2023, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $392,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Six Months 2022. The increase was due to an increase in subject\npremiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering the\nperiod from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from\nnamed storms are excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023\nthrough January 1, 2024.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. In accordance with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 goals, we have reduced our PML, and in the Six Months 2023, our premiums ceded under\ncatastrophe treaties decreased by $190,000 as compared to the comparable ceded premiums in Six Months 2022, in spite of a large catastrophe reinsurance rate\nincrease on our book effective July 1, 2022.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $3,188,000, or 5.8%, to $57,763,000 in Six Months 2023 from $54,575,000 in Six Months 2022. The increase was\ndue in part to the 2.7% increase in direct written premiums during Six Months 2023, but also from the increased premiums written in prior periods due to rate\nincreases and increased replacement costs. The run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty increased the premiums ceded and reduced the growth of net\npremiums earned.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nSix months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 10,741 $ 9,234 $ 1,507 16.3%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 117 163 (46) (28.2)%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 10,858 $ 9,397 $ 1,461 15.5%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nCeding commission revenue was $10,858,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $9,397,000 in Six Months 2022. The increase of $1,461,000 was due\nto an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned offset by a decrease in contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of\nprovisional ceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Six Months 2023 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $10,741,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty, and in Six Months 2022 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $9,234,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023\nTreaty. The increase of $1,507,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the increase premiums ceded under these treaties during Six Months\n2023 compared to Six Months 2022.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2023/2024 Treaty and the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $2,993,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $1,993,000 in Six Months 2022, an increase of $1,000,000, or 50.2%. The\nincrease in investment income is attributable to a $766,000 reversal in Six Months 2022 of prior years’ estimated accrued interest income stemming from an\nerror in third party investment reporting. The increase was also due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances. The average yield on non-cash invested\nassets was 3.63% as of June 30, 2023 compared to 3.51% as of June 30, 2022.\nCash and invested assets were $175,407,000 as of June 30, 2023 compared to $193,784,000 as of June 30, 2022. The $18,377,000 decrease in cash\nand invested assets was primarily attributable to increased disbursements of losses in connection with higher severity and inflation’s impact on losses along\nwith catastrophe losses incurred in 2023 and prior periods. An increase in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio also contributed to the reduction.\n49\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $1,422,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to net (losses) of $(8,916,000) in Six Months 2022. Unrealized gains on our\nequity securities and other investments in Six Months 2023 were $1,435,000, compared to net unrealized (losses) of $(8,705,000) in Six Months 2022. Realized\n(losses) on sales of investments were $(13,000) in Six Months 2023 compared to realized (losses) of $211,000 in Six Months 2022.\nOther Income\nOther income was $312,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $480,000 in Six Months 2022, a decrease of $168,000, or 35.0%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $44,620,000 for Six Months 2023 compared to $41,597,000 for Six Months 2022. The net loss ratio was 77.2% in Six Months\n2023 compared to 76.2% in Six Months 2022, an increase of 1.0 percentage point.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n50\nTable of Contents\nFor Six Months 2023, the net loss ratio was higher than for Six Months 2022 mainly due to a bigger impact from catastrophe losses.\nThe net catastrophe losses were $5,125,000 for Six Months 2023, which contributed 8.9 points to the loss ratio. There were two winter storm events\nand three wind events classified as catastrophe for Six Months 2023, including a major freezing event at the beginning of February. As a comparison,\ncatastrophe events had a loss ratio impact of 5.7 points for Six Months 2022.\nThe underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of catastrophe and prior year development) was 68.4% for Six Months 2023, a decrease of\n1.6 points from the 70.0% underlying loss ratio recorded for Six Months 2022. The underlying loss experience in Six Months 2023 was improved due to lower\nfrequency but was offset by increasing severity resulting from an elevated number of large losses.\nPrior year development was stable for Six Months 2023. There was an overall favorable development of $19,000, which had marginal impact on the\nloss ratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $17,011,000 in Six Months 2023 or 16.9% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $16,832,000 in Six\nMonths 2022 or 18.2% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $179,000 was primarily due to an increase in direct earned premiums of $8,453,000 to\n$100,822,000 but offset in part by a reduction of commission rates on our legacy policies in accordance with Kingstone 3.0 as well as the lower commission\nrate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $13,555,000, or 13.4% of direct earned premiums, in Six Months 2023 compared to $13,441,000, or 14.6% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Six Months 2022. The increase of $114,000, or 0.8%, was primarily due to increases in expenses related to our growth in direct\nearned premiums and salaries, partially offset by decreases in professional fees, credit card fees and policy management system fees as result of the completion\nof our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $5,875,000 in Six Months 2023\ncompared to $5,066,000 in Six Months 2022. The increase of $809,000, or 16.0%, is greater than the 2.7% increase in direct written premiums. In the periods\nfollowing Six Months 2022, we continued to strengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated managers and\nstaff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies.\n51\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Six Months 2023 was 33.6% compared to 37.4% in Six Months 2022.

The following table shows a breakdown of the significant components of other operating expenses for the periods indicated:\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nOther operating expenses\nEmployement costs $ 198 $ (96) $ 294 na%\nBonuses - - - na\nEquity compensation 429 1,016 (587) (57.8)\nProfessional 232 147 85 57.8\nDirectors fees 139 164 (25) (15.2)\nInsurance 87 77 10 13.0\nOther expenses 341 240 101 42.1\nTotal other operating expenses $ 1,426 $ 1,548 $ (122) (7.9)%\n(Components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nThe decrease in Six Months 2023 of $122,000, or 7.9%, as compared to Six Months 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in equity compensation,\npartially offset by an increase in employment costs. The increase in employment costs was due to the hiring of our new Chief Financial Officer in Six Months\n2023 and fluctuations in deferred compensation liability related to changes in the underlying invested portfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,587,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $1,647,000 in Six Months 2022. The decrease of $60,000, or 3.6%, in\ndepreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in Kingstone\n2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems. Depreciation\non older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer useful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Six Months 2023 was $2,016,000 compared to $913,000 in Six Months 2022, an increase of $1,103,000 or 120.8%. In Six Months\n2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred increased interest expense in connection with the 2022 Notes,\nwhich provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing. In Six Months 2022, we incurred interest expense in connection\nwith the 2017 Notes, our $30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017, which provided for interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit in Six Months 2023 was $1,290,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 18.8%. Income tax benefit in Six Months\n2022 was $3,871,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.0%. Loss before taxes was $6,867,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $18,448,000 in Six\nMonths 2022. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Six Months 2023 compared to Six Months 2022.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $5,577,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $14,577,000 in Six Months 2022. The decrease in net loss of $9,000,000 was due to the\ncircumstances described above.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2022\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nRevenues\nDirect written premiums $ 47,647 $ 49,778 $ (2,131) (4.3)%\nAssumed written premiums - - - na%\n47,647 49,778 (2,131) (4.3)%\nCeded written premiums\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) 11,034 11,803 (769) (6.5)%\nCeded to excess of loss treaties 1,062 886 176 19.9%\nCeded to catastrophe treaties 6,969 7,063 (94) (1.3)%\nTotal ceded written premiums 19,064 19,752 (687) (3.5)%\nNet written premiums 28,583 30,026 (1,443) (4.8)%\nChange in unearned premiums\nDirect and assumed 3,245 (2,786) 6,031 na%\nCeded to quota share treaties (1) (2,320) 663 (2,983) na%\nChange in net unearned premiums 925 (2,123) 3,048 na%\nPremiums earned\nDirect and assumed 50,892 46,992 3,900 8.3%\nCeded to reinsurance treaties (21,384) (19,090) (2,294) (12.0)%\nNet premiums earned 29,508 27,902 1,606 5.8%\nCeding commission revenue (1) 5,412 4,716 696 14.8%\nNet investment income 1,451 634 817 128.9%\nNet gains (losses) on investments 197 (4,517) 4,714 na%\nOther income 151 245 (94) (38.4)%\nTotal revenues 36,720 28,979 7,739 26.7%\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses\nDirect and assumed:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 28,346 26,323 2,023 7.7%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 2,489 195 2,294 1,176.4%\nTotal direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses 30,835 26,519 4,317 16.3%\nCeded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 10,148 7,780 2,368 30.4%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 1,107 83 1,024 1,233.7%\nTotal ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses 11,254 7,863 3,392 43.1%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses:\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes 18,198 18,544 (346) (1.9)%\nLosses from catastrophes (2) 1,383 112 1,271 1,134.8%\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses 19,581 18,656 925 5.0%\nCommission expense 8,471 8,481 (10) (0.1)%\nOther underwriting expenses 6,684 6,625 59 0.9%\nOther operating expenses 763 666 97 14.6%\nDepreciation and amortization 779 877 (98) (11.2)%\nInterest expense 1,006 457 549 120.1%\nTotal expenses 37,283 35,762 1,522 4.3%\nLoss before taxes (563) (6,782) 6,219 91.7%\nIncome tax benefit (41) (1,403) 1,362 97.1%\nNet loss $ (522) $ (5,380) $ 4,858 90.3%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n54\nTable of Contents\n(1) Effective December 31, 2021, we entered into a 30% personal lines quota share treaty.\n(2) The three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 include catastrophe losses, which are defined as losses from an event for which a catastrophe bulletin\nand related serial number has been issued by the Property Claims Services (PCS) unit of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). PCS catastrophe bulletins\nare issued for events that cause more than $25 million in total insured losses and affect a significant number of policyholders and insurers.\nThree months ended June 30,\nPercentage Percent\n2023 2022 Point Change Change\nKey ratios:\nNet loss ratio 66.4% 66.9% (0.5) (0.7)%\nNet underwriting expense ratio 32.5% 36.4% (3.9) (10.7)%\nNet combined ratio 98.9% 103.3% (4.4) (4.3)%\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the three months ended June 30, 2023 (“Three Months 2023”) were $47,647,000 compared to $49,778,000 during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2022 (“Three Months 2022”). The decrease of $2,131,000, or 4.3%, was primarily due to an increase in premiums from our\npersonal lines business, partially offset by an increase in premiums from our livery physical damage business.\nDirect written premiums from our personal lines business for Three Months 2023 were $44,011,000, a decrease of $2,781,000, or 5.9%, from\n$46,792,000 in Three Months 2022. The 5.9% decrease in premiums from our personal lines business was primarily due to decrease in premiums associated\nwith a 8.6% decrease in policies in force as of June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022, offset by rate increases. The rate increases achieved along with a\ndecrease in policies in force is in accordance with both our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategic plans.\nDirect written premiums from our livery physical damage business for Three Months 2023 were $3,610,000, an increase of $655,000, or 22.2%, from\n$2,954,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase in livery physical damage direct written premiums was due to an increasing number of policies and an increase\nin the values of the autos insured.\nBeginning in 2017, we started writing personal lines policies in New Jersey. Through 2019 we expanded to Rhode Island, Massachusetts and\nConnecticut. We refer to our New York business as our “Core” business and the business outside of New York as our “non-New York” business. Direct written\npremiums from our Core business were $42,211,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $39,734,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $2,478,000, or\n6.2%. Policies in force from our Core business decreased by 1.6% in Three Months 2023 compared to Three Months 2022. Direct written premiums from our\nnon-New York business were $5,435,000 in Three Months 2023 down from $10,044,000 in Three Months 2022, a decrease of $4,609,000, or 45.9%. Policies\nin force from our non-New York business decreased by 27% in Three Months 2023 compared to Three Months 2022. The increase in direct written premiums\nin our Core business and the decrease in our non-New Yok business is consistent with a key pillar of our Kingstone 3.0 strategy to reduce our non-New York\nbusiness due to profitability concerns.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business covering the period from December 31,\n2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of the 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share\nreinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”). Net written\npremiums decreased $1,443,000, or 4.8%, to $28,583,000 in Three Months 2023 from $30,026,000 in Three Months 2022. Net written premiums include direct\npremiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). In Three Months 2023, our\npremiums ceded under quota share treaties decreased by $769,000 in comparison to ceded premiums in Three Months 2022 (see table above). The increase in\nThree Months 2023 was attributable to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty, partially offset by a decrease in premiums subject to quota\nshare treaties as a result of the decrease in direct written premiums discussed above. The remainder of the 2021/2023 Treaty was on a cutoff basis and the new\n2023/2024 Treaty was placed for 30% on January 1, 2023. Our personal lines business was subject to the 2023/2024 Treaty in Three Months 2023, and the\n2021-2023 Treaty in Three Months 2022.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaties\nAn increase in written premiums will increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. In Three Months 2023, our ceded excess of loss\nreinsurance premiums increased by $176,000 over the comparable ceded premiums for Three Months 2022. The increase was due to an increase in subject\npremiums and the heightened cost of coverage obtained. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an underlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty covering the\nperiod from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from\nnamed storms are excluded from the treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023\nthrough January 1, 2024.\nCatastrophe reinsurance treaties\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines policies are also subject to our catastrophe treaties. An increase in our personal lines business\ngives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums ceded under catastrophe treaties will increase.\nAn increase in our personal lines business results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaties if reinsurance rates are stable or are\nincreasing. In accordance with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 goals, we have reduced our PML, and in the Three Months 2023, our premiums ceded\nunder catastrophe treaties decreased by $94,000 as compared to the comparable ceded premiums in Three Months 2022, in spite of a large catastrophe\nreinsurance rate increase on our book effective July 1, 2022.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $1,606,000, or 5.8%, to $29,508,000 in Three Months 2023 from $27,902,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase\nwas due to the increased premiums written in prior periods due to rate increases and increased replacement costs, offset by the 4.3% decrease in direct written\npremiums during Three Months 2023. In addition, the run-off of a portion of the 2021-2023 Treaty increased the premiums ceded and reduced the growth of\nnet premiums earned.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Change Percent\nProvisional ceding commissions earned $ 5,294 $ 4,693 $ 601 12.8%\nContingent ceding commissions earned 118 23 95 413.0%\nTotal ceding commission revenue $ 5,412 $ 4,716 $ 696 14.8%\n(Columns in the table above may not sum to totals due to rounding)\nCeding commission revenue was $5,412,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $4,716,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase of $696,000 was due\nto an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned and an increase in contingent ceding commissions earned. See below for a discussion of provisional\nceding commissions earned and contingent ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nIn Three Months 2023 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $5,294,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2023/2024\nTreaty, and in Three Months 2022 we earned provisional ceding commissions of $4,693,000 from personal lines earned premiums ceded under the 2021/2023\nTreaty. The increase of $601,000 in provisional ceding commissions earned was due to the runoff of an 8.5% portion of the 30% 2021/2023 Treaty, partially\noffset by a decrease in premiums subject to quota share treaties as a result of the decrease in direct written premiums discussed above.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nThe structure of the 2023/2024 Treaty and the 2021/2023 Treaty calls for a fixed provisional ceding commission with no opportunity to earn additional\ncontingent ceding commissions. Under our prior years’ quota share treaties, we received a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to\nthe losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we received.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $1,451,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $634,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $817,000, or 128.9%. The\nincrease in investment income is attributable to a $766,000 reversal in Three Months 2022 of prior years’ estimated accrued interest income stemming from an\nerror in third party investment reporting. The increase was also due to higher interest rates earned on cash balances. The average yield on non-cash invested\nassets was 3.63% as of June 30, 2023 compared to 3.51% as of June 30, 2022.\nCash and invested assets were $175,407,000 as of June 30, 2023 compared to $193,784,000 as of June 30, 2022. The $18,377,000 decrease in cash\nand invested assets was primarily attributable to increased disbursements of losses in connection with higher severity and inflation’s impact on losses along\nwith catastrophe losses incurred in 2023 and prior periods. An increase in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio also contributed to the reduction.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNet Gains (Losses) on Investments\nNet gains on investments were $197,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to net (losses) of $(4,517,000) in Three Months 2022. Unrealized gains on\nour equity securities and other investments in Three Months 2023 were $207,000, compared to net unrealized (losses) of $(4,229,000) in Three Months 2022.\nRealized (losses) on sales of investments were $(10,000) in Three Months 2023 compared to realized (losses) of $289,000 in Three Months 2022.\nOther Income\nOther income was $151,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $245,000 in Three Months 2022, a decrease of $94,000, or 38.4%.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $19,581,000 for Three Months 2023 compared to $18,656,000 for Three Months 2022. The net loss ratio was 66.4% in Three\nMonths 2023 compared to 66.9% in Three Months 2022, a decrease of 0.5 percentage point.\nThe following graph summarizes the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated, along with the comparable components\nexcluding commercial lines business:\n(Percent components may not sum to totals due to rounding)\n58\nTable of Contents\nFor Three Months 2023, the loss ratio was slightly lower than Three Months 2022. While the underlying loss ratio (loss ratio excluding the impact of\ncatastrophe and prior year development) was improved for Three Months 2023 compared to Three Months 2022, the catastrophe loss had a bigger impact for\nThree Months 2023.\nThere were three wind events classified as catastrophe for Three Months 2023. The total net catastrophe losses for the calendar quarter were\n$1,383,000, which contributed 4.7 points to the loss ratio. This compares to a 0.4-point impact from catastrophe events for Three Months 2022.\nThe underlying loss ratio was 61.7% for Three Months 2023, a decrease of 3.8 points from the 65.5% underlying loss ratio recorded for Three Months\n2022. The underlying loss experience for Three Months 2023 was improved due to lower frequency which is believed to be the result of the Company’s new\nproduct rollout as well as the Company’s active efforts to manage less profitable segments. Such improvement in loss experience was offset by an elevated\nnumber of large losses, similar to what was observed in the first three months of 2023.\nPrior year development was stable for Three Months 2023. There was an overall favorable development of $16,000, which had marginal impact on the\nloss ratio.\nSee table below under “Additional Financial Information” summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $8,471,000 in Three Months 2023 or 16.6% of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $8,481,000 in Three\nMonths 2022 or 18.0% of direct earned premiums. The decrease of $10,000 was primarily due to a reduction of commission rates on our legacy policies in\naccordance with Kingstone 3.0 as well as the lower commission rate paid on Select products as compared to legacy products, but offset by an increase in direct\nearned premiums of $3,899,000 to $50,892,000.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $6,684,000, or 13.1% of direct earned premiums, in Three Months 2023 compared to $6,625,000, or 14.1% of\ndirect earned premiums, in Three Months 2022. The increase of $59,000, or 0.9%, was primarily due to increases in expenses related to our growth in direct\nearned premiums and salaries, partially offset by decreases in professional fees, credit card fees and policy management system fees as result of the completion\nof our policy management system conversion, allowing us to eliminate multiple legacy systems.\nOur largest single component of other underwriting expenses is salaries and employment costs, with costs of $2,942,000 in Three Months 2023\ncompared to $2,518,000 in Three Months 2022. The increase of $424,000, or 16.8%, compared unfavorably to the 4.3% decrease in direct written premiums. In\nthe periods following Three Months 2022, we continued to strengthen our professional team by investing in the hiring of higher-level and higher compensated\nmanagers and staff needed to manage the business consistent with our Kingstone 2.0 and Kingstone 3.0 strategies.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in Three Months 2023 was 32.5% compared to 36.4% in Three Months 2022.

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in equity compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $779,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $877,000 in Three Months 2022. The decrease of $98,000, or 11.2%,\nin depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the completion and deployment of our customized policy management software as planned for in\nKingstone 2.0, now allowing us to consolidate multiple legacy systems into one efficient system and retire those older more costly and less reliable systems.\nDepreciation on older assets that were retired, which had a shorter useful life, is greater than the depreciation on newly acquired assets which have a longer\nuseful life.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in Three Months 2023 was $1,006,000 compared to $457,000 in Three Months 2022, an increase of $549,000 or 120.1%. In Three\nMonths 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we incurred increased interest expense in connection with the 2022\nNotes, which provide for interest at the rate of 12% per annum, and the 2022 equipment financing. In Three Months 2022, we incurred interest expense in\nconnection with the 2017 Notes, our $30.0 million issuance of long-term debt in December 2017, which provided for interest at the rate of 5.5% per annum.\n61\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit in Three Months 2023 was $41,000, which resulted in an effective tax benefit rate of 7.3%. Income tax benefit in Three Months\n2022 was $1,403,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.7%. Loss before taxes was $563,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $6,782,000 in\nThree Months 2022. The difference in effective tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences in Three Months 2023 compared to Three Months 2022.\nNet Loss\nNet loss was $522,000 in Three Months 2023 compared to $5,380,000 in Three Months 2022.

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources\n(“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or\nunavailable (“unobservable inputs”). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted\nprices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority (“Level 1”), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for\nsimilar but not identical assets or liabilities (“Level 2”), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity’s estimates of the assumption that market\nparticipants would use, having the lowest priority (“Level 3”). As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 62% and 65%, respectively, of the investment\nportfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the\nsecurity has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nJune 30, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $ 5,927,580 $ (59,420) 1 $ - - - $ 5,927,580 $ (59,420)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 148,703 (2,652) 1 13,448,464 (3,489,849) 13 13,597,167 (3,492,501)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 6,860,908 (270,230) 12 64,548,129 (7,511,387) 77 71,409,037 (7,781,617)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 101,701 (1,621) 4 41,865,274 (7,592,927) 38 41,966,975 (7,594,548)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $13,038,892 $ (333,923) 18 $119,861,867 $(18,594,163) 128 $132,900,759 $(18,928,086)\n71\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nEstimated No. of Estimated No. of Estimated\nFair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized Positions Fair Unrealized\nCategory Value Losses Held Value Losses Held Value Losses\nFixed-Maturity Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities and\nobligations of U.S. government\ncorporations and agencies $18,918,196 $ (6,928) 3 $ - - - $ 18,918,196 $ (6,928)\nPolitical subdivisions of States,\nTerritories and Possessions 7,970,633 (2,195,273) 9 5,170,753 (1,771,494) 5 13,141,386 (3,966,767)\nCorporate and other bonds\nindustrial and miscellaneous 56,910,104 (5,796,994) 75 15,172,381 (2,458,985) 15 72,082,485 (8,255,979)\nResidential mortgage and other\nasset backed securities 10,145,880 (882,664) 22 34,753,178 (7,150,803) 26 44,899,058 (8,033,467)\nTotal fixed-maturity securities $93,944,813 $(8,881,859) 109 $55,096,312 $(11,381,282) 46 $149,041,125 $(20,263,141)\n72\nTable of Contents\nThere were 146 securities at June 30, 2023 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale, none of\nwhich were deemed to be credit losses by us. There were 155 securities at December 31, 2022 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss of our fixed-maturity\nsecurities available-for-sale, none of which were deemed to be credit losses by us. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were\ntemporary included credit quality considerations, the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security’s cost, the nature of the investment and\ninterest rate environment factors, management’s intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these\ninvestments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions\nfrom our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds\nare used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance\ncommissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other\nunderwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nThe primary source of cash flow for our holding company are dividends received from KICO, which are subject to statutory restrictions. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, KICO paid a dividend of $1,250,000 to us. As of June 30, 2023, KICO had a negative unassigned surplus and currently will not\nbe able to pay any distributions to us without prior regulatory approval.\nKICO is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”), which provides additional access to liquidity. Members have access\nto a variety of flexible, low cost funding through FHLBNY’s credit products, enabling members to customize advances. Advances are to be fully collateralized;\neligible collateral to pledge to FHLBNY includes residential and commercial mortgage backed securities, along with U.S. Treasury and agency securities. See\nNote 3 – Investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements for eligible collateral held in a designated custodian account available for future\nadvances. Advances are limited to 5% of KICO’s net admitted assets as of the end of the previous quarter, which is March 31, 2023, and are due and payable\nwithin 90 days of borrowing. The maximum allowable advance as of June 30, 2023, based on the net admitted assets as of March 31, 2023, was approximately\n$13,268,000. Available collateral as of June 30, 2023 was approximately $11,799,000. Advances are limited to 85% of the amount of available collateral. There\nwere no borrowings under this facility during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, we issued $19,950,000 of our 2022 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. We are required to make a mandatory\nredemption payment with regard to the 2022 Notes on December 30, 2023 in an amount discussed in Note 7 – Debt of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Quarterly Report. We are also required to make semi-annual interest payments in arrears on June 30 and December 30 of each year,\ncommencing on June 30, 2023. The maturity date of the 2022 Notes is December 30, 2024.\n73\nTable of Contents\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are\nshown in the following table:\nSix Months ended June 30, 2023 2022\nCash flows (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (17,009,995) $ (13,716,630)\nInvesting activities 17,890,127 3,857,225\nFinancing activities (551,936) (1,231,065)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 328,196 (11,090,470)\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period 11,958,228 24,290,598\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period $ 12,286,424 $ 13,200,128\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17,010,000 in Six Months 2023 as compared to $13,717,000 used in operating activities in Six Months\n2022. The $3,293,000 increase in cash flows used in operating activities in Six Months 2023 as compared to Six Months 2022 was primarily the result of an\nincrease in cash arising from net fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $412,000. The\nincrease in cash used in operating activities is also partially offset by the payment of $13,245,000 to reinsurers in Six Months 2022 pursuant to the inception of\nour quota share reinsurance treaty, effective December 31, 2021. The net fluctuations in assets and liabilities are related to operating activities of KICO as\naffected by growth or declines in its operations, payments on claims and other changes, which are described above.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $17,890,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $3,857,000 provided by investing activities in Six Months\n2022 resulting in a $14,033,000 increase in net cash provided by investing activities. In Six Months 2023, we had net cash provided by our investment portfolio\nof $18,789,000, compared to $6,398,000 used in Six Months 2022. In addition, we decreased our acquisition of fixed assets by $1,642,000 in Six Months 2023\ncompared to Six Months 2022.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $552,000 in Six Months 2023 compared to $1,231,000 used in Six Months 2022. The $679,000 decrease in\nnet cash used in financing activities was attributable to no dividends being paid to shareholders in Six Months 2023 compared to $851,000 being paid in Six\nMonths 2022 and a $378,000 decrease in withholding taxes paid on the vesting of restricted stock awards. The decreases in cash used in financing activities\nwere partially offset by $536,000 of principal payments on the equipment financing in connection with KICO’s sale-leaseback transaction.\nReinsurance\nEffective December 31, 2021, we entered into a quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of\nhomeowners’ and dwelling fire policies, covering the period from December 31, 2021 through January 1, 2023 (“2021/2023 Treaty”). Upon the expiration of\nthe 2021/2023 Treaty on January 1, 2023, we entered into a new quota share reinsurance treaty for our personal lines business, covering the period from\nJanuary 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024 (“2023/2024 Treaty”).\n74\nTable of Contents\nWe entered into new excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance treaties effective July 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, we entered into an\nunderlying excess of loss reinsurance treaty (“Underlying XOL Treaty”) covering the period from January 1, 2022 through January 1, 2023. The Underlying\nXOL Treaty provides 50% reinsurance coverage for losses of $400,000 in excess of $600,000. Losses from named storms are excluded from the Underlying\nXOL Treaty. Effective January 1, 2023, the Underlying XOL Treaty was renewed covering the period from January 1, 2023 through January 1, 2024.

We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where\nhistorical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new\ninvestments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nSix Months 2023 included continuing economic inflation, which resulted in a sustained increase in interest rates, a widening of credit spreads, lower\npublic equity valuations, and significant financial market volatility. The higher interest rates and widening of credit spreads previously reduced the value of our\nfixed income securities, saw a reversal which had previously lowered our stockholders’ equity materially in prior quarters. For Six Months 2023, the continuing\neconomic inflation impacted our loss and loss adjustment expenses as well; should these trends continue in the near-term, it would in all likelihood negatively\nimpact our results of operations.\n76\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nOutlook\nOur net premiums earned may be impacted by a number of factors. Net premiums earned are a function of net written premium volume. Net written\npremiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. Net written\npremiums from both renewal and new business are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions. We have made\nunderwriting changes to emphasize profitability over growth and have culled out the type of risks that do not generate an acceptable level of return. This action\nhas led, and may continue to lead, to a slowdown in premium growth, particularly in new business.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThis item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to assure that\ninformation required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were: (i) effective in recording,\nprocessing, summarizing, and reporting information on a timely basis that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct, and (ii) effective in ensuring that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosure.\nAs required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on\nthis evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30,\n2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nInherent Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial\nOfficer, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith policies and procedures may deteriorate.\n77\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

(Nasdaq: KINS)** (the “Company” or “Kingstone”), a Northeast regional property and casualty insurance holding company, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The Company will host a conference call for analysts and investors on May 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, as previously announced on April 21, 2023. \n\n** Financial and Operational Highlights  ** **2023 First Quarter** _(All results are compared to prior year quarterly period unless otherwise noted)_\n\n  * Loss per share of $(0.47) compared to loss per share of $(0.87); net operating loss per share1 of $(0.56) compared to $(0.54). Losses attributable to catastrophes were $(0.27) per share compared to $(0.22) \n  * Book value per share of $3.09, down 8.6% from the prior quarter. Book value per share excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss)1 was $4.39 \n  * Direct written premiums1 grew by 10.7% to $47.6 million \n  * Net premiums earned increased 5.9% to $28.3 million \n  * Net combined ratio decreased to 123.3% from 124.5% \n  * Net loss ratio was 88.6%, up from 86.0%, including 13.2% of catastrophe losses up from 11.3% \n  * Net underwriting expense ratio decreased to 34.7% from 38.5% \n  * Net combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year loss development1 was 110.1% compared to 113.2% \n  * No shares repurchased during Q1 \n\n\n\n**Annual Meeting of Stockholders**\n\nAs previously announced, the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on Wednesday, August 9, 2023 at 9:00 A.M. at 15 Joys Lane, Kingston, New York. Stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2023 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. \n\n__________________ 1 These measures are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n\n**Management Commentary**\n\nBarry Goldstein, Kingstone's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We have been working diligently to strengthen and fortify our business, as we continue to navigate today’s challenging environment. While we are reporting an underwriting loss for the first quarter, this is not unexpected given the difficult northeast winter and reflects a reality of operating within this region. Looking ahead, I believe that many of the headwinds we’ve faced will begin to slow, enabling us to see increasing benefits from the strategic actions we’ve taken. Our entire team remains relentlessly focused on improving our underwriting results and returning Kingstone to profitability.” \n\nJennifer Gravelle, Kingstone’s Chief Financial Offer, continued, “While our underwriting loss this quarter was comparable to last year due to weather-related events, our investment results improved due to the stabilization of the capital markets. Further, we’ve continued to make great progress on our disciplined expense reduction efforts, an important part of building a strong foundation for sustained growth.” \n\nMeryl Golden, Kingstone's Chief Operating Officer, concluded, “We’ve already made inroads on Kingstone 3.0, our four-pillar strategy for 2023 and 2024, which we introduced last quarter. We’re rapidly offloading our unprofitable non-New York book of business to enhance our bottom line, are seeing average premiums up materially due to rate changes and updated replacement costs, have kept our tight underwriting criteria in place and implemented a host of initiatives to manage our PML, and are reporting that our expense ratio is down considerably and continues to decline. I’m optimistic for Kingstone’s future and remain laser-focused on implementing our strategic plan that will restore us to profitability and deliver long term value for shareholders.” \n\nSee “Forward-Looking Statements” \n\n**Financial Highlights Table**\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**March 31,**  \n($ in thousands except per share data) |  ** 2023 ** |  ** 2022 ** |  ** % Change **  \nDirect written premiums1 |  $  |  47,597  |  $  |  42,984  |  10.7%   \nNet written premiums1 |  $  |  23,969  |  $  |  24,918  |  -3.8%   \nNet premiums earned |  $  |  28,255  |  $  |  26,673  |  5.9%   \nTotal ceding commission revenue |  $  |  5,445  |  $  |  4,681  |  16.3%   \nNet investment income |  $  |  1,541  |  $  |  1,359  |  13.4%   \nNet gains (losses) on investments |  $  |  1,225  |  $  |  (4,398)  |  na   \nU.S. GAAP loss |  $  |  (5,055)  |  $  |  (9,198)  |  -45.0%   \nU.S. GAAP Diluted loss per share |  $  |  (0.47)  |  $  |  (0.87)  |  -45.7%   \nComprehensive loss |  $  |  (3,103)  |  $  |  (16,959)  |  -81.7%   \nNet operating loss1 |  $  |  (6,022)  |  $  |  (5,723)  |  5.2%   \nNet operating loss1 per share |  $  |  (0.56)  |  $  |  (0.54)  |  4.0%   \nReturn on average equity (annualized) |  -58.2%  |  -54.9%  |  6.0%   \nNet loss ratio |  88.6%  |  86.0%  | 2.6 pts  \nNet underwriting expense ratio |  34.7%  |  38.5%  | -3.8 pts  \nNet combined ratio |  123.3%  |  124.5%  | -1.2 pts  \nEffect of catastrophes and prior year loss  \ndevelopment on net combined ratio1 | 13.2 pts | 11.3 pts | 1.9 pts  \nNet combined ratio excluding effect of  \ncatastrophes and prior year loss  \ndevelopment1 |  110.1%  |  113.2%  | -3.1 pts  \n1 These measures are not based on GAAP and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  \n  \n** 2023 First Quarter Financial Review **\n\n_ Net loss:  _Net loss was $5.1 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, compared to net loss of $9.2 million in the prior year period. Typically, the first quarter of the year produces an underwriting loss due to the geographic positioning of Kingstone’s policyholders. \n\n_ Earnings (Loss) per share (“EPS”):  _Kingstone reported EPS of $(0.47) per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to EPS of $(0.87) per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2022. EPS for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was based on 10.8 million and 10.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, respectively. \n\n_ Direct Written Premiums,1 Net Written Premiums1 and Net Premiums Earned  _Direct written premiums1 for the first quarter of 2023 were $47.6 million, an increase of $4.6 million, or 10.7%, from $43.0 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to a $4.0 million increase in premiums from our personal lines business and a $0.6 million increase in our livery physical damage product. \n\nNet written premiums1 decreased $0.9 million, or 3.8%, to $24.0 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 from $24.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease in the first quarter was attributable to the runoff of a 8.5% portion of a 30% personal lines quota share treaty. The remainder of the treaty was on a cutoff basis and was placed at 30% on January 1, 2023. \n\nNet premiums earned for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 increased 5.9% to $28.3 million, compared to $26.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the first quarter was attributable to an increase in direct written premiums. \n\n_ Net Loss Ratio _: For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s net loss ratio was 88.6%, compared to 86.0% in the prior year period. The loss ratio increased from the prior year period mainly due to an increase in catastrophe losses. The impact of catastrophe losses was 13.2 points for 2023 compared to 11.3 points in the prior year. \n\n_ Net Underwriting Expense Ratio _: For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the net underwriting expense ratio was 34.7% as compared to 38.5% in the prior year period, a decrease of 3.8 percentage points. The decrease in the first quarter was primarily attributable to the increase in provisional ceding commissions from the 30% personal lines quota share, a decrease in IT expenses from the retirement of the Company’s legacy systems and changes to producer commissions.. \n\n____________________ 1 These measures are not based on GAAP and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \n\n** Balance Sheet / Investment Portfolio  **Kingstone’s cash and investment holdings were $190.6 million at March 31, 2023 compared to $191.0 million at March 31, 2022. The Company’s investment holdings are comprised primarily of investment grade corporate, mortgage-backed and municipal securities, with fixed income investments representing approximately 90.1% of total investments at March 31, 2023 and 90.7% at December 31, 2022. The Company’s effective duration on its fixed-income portfolio is 4.3 years. \n\nNet investment income increased 13.4% to $1.54 million for the first quarter of 2023 from $1.36 million in the prior year period. \n\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income/ (Loss) (“AOCI”), net of tax As of March 31, 2023, AOCI was a loss of $(14.0) million compared to loss of $(16.0) million at December 31, 2022. The increase in AOCI at March 31, 2023 of $2.0 million is attributable to the impact of stabilizing interest rates on available for sale securities since December 31, 2022. \n\n** Share Repurchase Program **\n\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. \n\n** Book Value  **The Company’s book value per share at March 31, 2023 was $3.09, a decline of 8.6% compared to $3.38 at December 31, 2022. \n\n**31-Mar-23** |  **31-Dec-22** |  **30-Sep-22** |  **30-Jun-22** |  **31-Mar-22**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Book Value Per Share** |  $  |  3.09  |  $  |  3.38  |  $  |  3.65  |  $  |  4.42  |  $  |  5.50   \n_% Increase from specified period to 3/31/23_ |  _-8.6%_ |  _-15.3%_ |  _-30.1%_ |  _-43.8%_  \n  \n** Book value excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income per Share1 **\n\nThe Company’s book value excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) per share at March 31, 2023 was $4.39, a decline of 9.8% compared to $4.87 at December 31, 2022. \n\n**31-Mar-23** |  **31-Dec-22** |  **30-Sep-22** |  **30-Jun-22** |  **31-Mar-22**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Book Value Per Share Excluding Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income 1** |  $  |  4.39  |  $  |  4.87  |  $  |  5.15  |  $  |  5.55  |  $  |  6.06   \n_% Increase from specified period to 3/31/23_ |  _-9.8%_ |  _-14.7%_ |  _-20.8%_ |  _-27.5%_  \n  \n____________________ 1 This measure is not based on GAAP and is defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. \n\n** Conference Call Details **\n\nManagement will discuss the Company’s operations and financial results in a conference call on Friday, May 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. ET. \n\nThe dial-in numbers are: 877-407-3105 (U.S.) 201-493-6794 (International) \n\n** Accompanying Webcast  **The call will be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the Kingstone website or by clicking on the conference call link: \n\n[Kingstone Companies First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Webcast ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DzvRPvU7L&esheet=53398809&newsitemid=20230511005726&lan=en-US&anchor=Kingstone+Companies+First+Quarter+2023+Financial+Results+Webcast&index=1&md5=3730f448e7d1f65148f076255fc85170) The webcast will be archived and accessible for approximately 30 days. \n\n** Definitions and Non-GAAP Measures **\n\n** Direct written premiums ** represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the Company during the respective fiscal period. **Net premiums written** are direct written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers. Net premiums earned, the GAAP measure most comparable to direct written premiums and net premiums written, are net premiums written that are pro-rata earned during the fiscal period presented. All of the Company’s policies are written for a twelve-month period. Management uses direct written premiums and net premiums written, along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results. \n\n** Net operating income (loss) ** - is net income (loss) exclusive of realized investment gains (losses), net of tax. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to net operating income (loss). \n\nManagement uses net operating income (loss) along with other measures to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including realized investment gains (losses), and may vary significantly between periods. Net operating income (loss) is provided as supplemental information, not as a substitute for net income (loss) and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability. \n\n** Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income ** - is book value per share excluding the impact of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income or AOCI. Management uses book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to evaluate the results to exclude the impact of interest rate changes on our fixed income portfolio. \n\n** Net combined ratio excluding effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development ** - is a non-GAAP ratio, which is computed as the difference between GAAP net combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development on the net combined ratio. \n\nWe believe that these ratios are useful to investors, and they are used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year loss development. Catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio and net combined ratio. Prior year loss development can cause our loss ratio to vary significantly between periods and separating this information allows us to better compare the results for the current accident period over time. We believe these measures are useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance. We also provide them to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is the net combined ratio. The net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development should not be considered a substitute for the net combined ratio and does not reflect the Company’s net combined ratio. \n\n____________________ \n\n**The table below reconciles direct written premiums and net written premiums to net premiums earned for the periods presented:**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**March 31,**  \n**%**  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **$ Change** |  **Change**  \n(000’s except percentages)  \n**Direct and Net Written Premiums Reconciliation:**  \n**Direct written premiums** |  $  |  47,597  |  $  |  42,984  |  $  |  4,613  |  10.7  |  %   \nCeded written premiums |  (23,628  |  )  |  (18,066  |  )  |  (5,562  |  )  |  30.8   \n**Net written premiums** |  23,969  |  24,918  |  (949  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )%   \nChange in unearned premiums |  4,286  |  1,755  |  2,531  |  144.2   \n**Net premiums earned** |  **$** |  **28,255** |  **$** |  **26,673** |  **$** |  **1,582** |  **5.9** |  **%**  \n_(Components may not sum due to rounding)_  \n  \n____________________ \n\n**The following table reconciles net operating loss to net (loss) income for the periods indicated:**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**March 31, 2023** |  **March 31, 2022**  \nAmount | Diluted loss per common share | Amount | Diluted loss per common share  \n(000’s except per common share amounts and percentages)  \n**Net Loss and Diluted Loss per Common Share Reconciliation:**  \n**Net loss** |  **$** |  **(5,055** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(0.47** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(9,198** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(0.87** |  **)**  \nNet realized (gain) loss on investments |  (1,225  |  )  |  4,398   \nLess tax (expense) benefit on net realized (gain) loss |  (257  |  )  |  924   \nNet realized (gain) loss on investments, net of taxes |  (968  |  )  |  **$** |  **(0.09** |  **)** |  3,474  |  **$** |  **0.33**  \n**Net operating loss** |  **$** |  **(6,022** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(0.56** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(5,723** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(0.54** |  **)**  \nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding |  10,756,913  | # |  10,630,450   \n_(Components may not sum due to rounding)_  \n  \n____________________ \n\n**The following table reconciles book value excluding accumulated other comprehensive (loss) incometo book value as of the dates indicated:**\n\n**31-Mar-23** |  **31-Dec-22** |  **30-Sep-22** |  **30-Jun-22** |  **31-Mar-22**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Book Value Per Share** |  $  |  3.09  |  $  |  3.38  |  $  |  3.65  |  $  |  4.42  |  $  |  5.50   \n**Accumulated other comprehensive loss** |  $  |  (14,007,076  |  )  |  $  |  (15,958,428  |  )  |  $  |  (15,978,570  |  )  |  $  |  (11,994,258  |  )  |  $  |  (5,964,578  |  )   \n**Shares outstanding** |  10,760,559  |  10,700,106  |  10,645,675  |  10,645,675  |  10,637,901   \n**Accumulated other comprehensive loss per common share** |  $  |  (1.30  |  )  |  $  |  (1.49  |  )  |  $  |  (1.50  |  )  |  $  |  (1.13  |  )  |  $  |  (0.56  |  )   \n**Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss** |  $  |  4.39  |  $  |  4.87  |  $  |  5.15  |  $  |  5.55  |  $  |  6.06   \n_(Components may not sum due to rounding)_  \n  \n____________________ \n\n**The following table reconciles the net combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year loss development to the net combined ratio for the periods presented:**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**March 31,**  \n**2023** |  **2022** |  **Percentage Point** **Change**  \n**Net Combined Ratio Excluding Catastrophes and Prior Year Loss Development Reconciliation:**  \n**Net Combined Ratio Excluding Catastrophes and Prior Year Loss Development** |  **110.1** |  **%** |  **113.2** |  **%** |  **(3.1** |  **)** |  **pts**  \nEffect of catastrophe losses and prior year loss development  \nCatastrophe losses |  13.2  |  %  |  11.3  |  %  |  1.9  | pts  \nPrior year loss development |  0.0  |  %  |  0.0  |  %  |  -

All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. For more details on factors that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Part I, Item 2 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the following: \n\n  * As a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events. \n\n\n  * Unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \n\n\n  * We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period. \n\n\n  * The insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business. \n\n\n  * Changing climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows. \n\n\n  * Because a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state. \n\n\n  * We are highly dependent on a relatively small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues. \n\n\n  * Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \n\n\n  * We rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business. \n\n\n\nKingstone undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20230511005726r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\n** Kingstone Companies, Inc.  ** Jennifer Gravelle Chief Financial Officer (845) 768-1970 \n\nSource: Kingstone Companies, Inc.\n"
