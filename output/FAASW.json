Importantly, DigiAsia owns all critical Fintech and Banking licenses to deploy and manage those finance solutions for its clients. DigiAsia also actively manages and grows a vast network of small merchants, Indonesia’s most important sales channel by far, to drive digital commerce acceptance and reach for its enterprise clients.\n\nToday, DigiAsia’s FaaS platform and ecosystem connects more than 200 of Indonesia’s leading enterprises with a network of over 1 million active merchants to accelerate B2B and B2C e-payment adoption, product and payment flow, working capital efficiency and fraud management. DigiAsia’s fintech solutions serve major industry players such as Starbucks, Unilever, Garuda and KAI (Indonesia National Railway). Southeast Asian government entities rely on DigiAsia to handle cross border transactions, and leading financial institutions such as DBS and Citibank serve as lenders that permit DigiAsia to bank the ecosystem.\n\n![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/themes/mziq_digiasia_otc/img/close.svg)\n\nQuick Access\n\n[ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/themes/mziq_digiasia_otc/img/home_results_arrow_prev.png) ](#) [ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/themes/mziq_digiasia_otc/img/home_results_arrow_next.png) ](#)\n\nteste\n\n  * [ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/1371/2024/05/Group.png) Quotes & Charts ](/stock/)\n  * [ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/1371/2024/05/Group-6.png) SEC Filings ](/financials/sec-filings/)\n  * [ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/1371/2024/05/Mailng.png) Email Alerts ](/resources/email-alerts/)\n  * [ ![](https://investors.digiasia.asia/wp-content/uploads/sites/1371/2024/05/image-15-Traced.png) IR Contact ](/resources/contact-ir/)\n\n\n\n## **Press Releases**\n\n[DigiAsia Corp. and Digit9 Announce Strategic Collaboration](Javascript:OpenApiStory\\('https://www.pressviewer.com/profiles/investor/NewsPrint.asp?v=7&b=2953&ID=139322&m=rl&g=2825','LibDiv'\\); \"DigiAsia Corp. and Digit9 Announce Strategic Collaboration\")October 16, 2024\n\n[PayMate Announces Intent to Acquire DigiAsia](Javascript:OpenApiStory\\('https://www.pressviewer.com/profiles/investor/NewsPrint.asp?v=7&b=2953&ID=138391&m=rl&g=2825','LibDiv'\\); \"PayMate Announces Intent to Acquire DigiAsia\")September 24, 2024\n\n[DigiAsia Corp.
