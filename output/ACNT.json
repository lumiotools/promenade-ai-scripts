(Nasdaq: ACNT) (“Ascent” or the “Company”), an industrials company focused on the production of specialty chemicals and industrial tubular products, is reporting its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary 1**  \n---  \n_(in millions, except per share and margin)_ |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Change**  \nNet Sales  |  $42.9  |  $46.7  |  (8.2)%   \nGross Profit  |  $6.5  |  $3.0  |  116.5%   \nGross Profit Margin  |  15.1%  |  6.4%  |  870bps   \nNet (Loss)  |  $(7.0)  |  $(14.7)  |  (52.2)%   \nDiluted (Loss) per Share  |  $(0.69)  |  $(1.45)  |  (52.4)%   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $2.5  |  $(1.5)  |  262.8%   \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin  |  5.7%  |  (3.2)%  |  890bps   \n  \n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter marked another period of positive momentum as we generated our third straight quarter of improving results,” said Ascent CEO Bryan Kitchen. “Although market conditions remained soft across both segments, we continued to strip out unnecessary costs and operate more efficiently through aggressive self-help initiatives, leading to both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter improvements to our bottom line. We also made notable progress on the business development front within our specialty chemicals segment, which we believe will begin to show revenue growth in 2025 as we remain committed to unlocking the full potential of this segment. \n\n“Overall, we are creating a more predictable, reliable, and profitable operating model, as evidenced by our consistently improving results over the last three quarters. While demand across our end markets isn’t doing us any favors, I’m proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish so far this year in our efforts to stabilize the organization through recapitalizing SG&A, strict cost management, product line optimization, and dynamic pricing adjustments. These actions combined with our healthy balance sheet and no outstanding debt have us well positioned to finish the year on a positive note and move into 2025 with momentum at our back.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales from continuing operations were $42.9 million compared to $46.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decline was primarily driven by lower volumes and lower pricing as the Company fulfilled low-priced order backlog within the tubular products segment, along with lower volumes in the specialty chemicals segment partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. \n\nGross profit from continuing operations increased 117% to $6.5 million, or 15.1% of net sales, compared to $3.0 million, or 6.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to aggressive cost management through improvements in product line management and strategic materials sourcing across both segments. \n\nNet loss from continuing operations improved to $7.0 million, or $0.69 diluted loss per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $14.7 million, or $1.45 diluted loss per share, in the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the Company recorded a $6.2 million non-cash, one-time tax charge related to a valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets. Income from continuing operations before taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.5 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in gross profit as well as a year-over-year decrease in interest expense due to lower debt outstanding. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased notably to $2.5 million compared to $(1.5) million in the third quarter of 2023, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing significantly to 5.7% compared to (3.2)% in the prior year period. The improvement was primarily driven by the aforementioned cost and product mix optimization initiatives. \n\n______________________  \n---  \n1 On December 22, 2023, the Company closed on a transaction to sell substantially all of the assets of Specialty Pipe & Tube (“SPT”). As a result, financial results from SPT have been categorized into discontinued operations.   \n  \n**Segment Results**\n\n**_Ascent Chemicals_** _–_ net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4% to $20.9 million compared to $20.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income in the third quarter improved significantly to $0.4 million compared to an operating loss of $(11.5) million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased 47% to $1.5 million compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of segment net sales, adjusted EBITDA increased 210 basis points to 7.3% compared to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Ascent Tubular_** _–_ net sales from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 were $22.0 million compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income from continuing operations in the third quarter improved to $1.7 million compared to an operating loss from continuing operations of $(0.6) million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the third quarter increased significantly to $2.4 million compared to $0.2 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of segment net sales, adjusted EBITDA increased significantly to 10.7% compared to 0.7% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $8.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had $57.5 million in availability under its revolving credit facility. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 42,623 shares at an average cost of $9.79 per share for approximately $0.4 million. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAscent will conduct a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nAscent management will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period. \n\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024 Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time Live Call Registration Link: [Here ](https://register.vevent.com/register/BI99cb4bcdf5f44fd0be78d0554649e78f)Webcast Registration Link: [Here](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fedge.media-server.com%2fmmc%2fp%2fpfc783zj&c=E,1,XlNfdNCmXz0YP-ohJrzuQaBVOG6-ag0EsHas1oRI6gj2E820EAPL-L8wir18wvwd35w9xTaQSsH2JsFy0gp-ai9Ax5wGASgwAcAIhCZDeWnBHXD3Bxw,&typo=1&ancr_add=1)\n\nTo access the call by phone, please register via the live call registration link above or [here](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fregister.vevent.com%2fregister%2fBI99cb4bcdf5f44fd0be78d0554649e78f&c=E,1,L3DVAkOugMjzh4DStLcQ6TMNnPurcHreNIHXP6H9cBbnCAEgmo01raqRnkkW2hSQiHg2kvrdlw-vRVm-R5mfMiBIwjA-8vyyFDGxAkk9ig,,&typo=1&ancr_add=1) and you will be provided with dial-in instructions and details.

All statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements can be identified through the use of words such as \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"should,\" \"anticipate,\" \"hope,\" \"optimistic,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"may\" and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and to review the risks as set forth in more detail in Ascent Industries Co.’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC or on our website. Ascent Industries Co. assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information included in this release. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nFinancial statement information included in this earnings release includes non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors in evaluating its results to determine the value of a company. An item is excluded in the measure if its periodic value is inconsistent and sufficiently material that not identifying the item would render period comparability less meaningful to the reader or if including the item provides a clearer representation of normalized periodic earnings. The Company excludes in Adjusted EBITDA two categories of items: 1) Base EBITDA components, including: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 2) Material transaction costs including: goodwill impairment, asset impairment, gain on lease modification, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease cost, acquisition costs and other fees, shelf registration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, retention costs and restructuring & severance costs from net income. \n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they are key measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions as well as allow readers to compare the financial results between periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. \n\n**Ascent Industries Co.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n(in thousands, except par value and share data)   \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  8,547  |  $  |  1,851   \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $583 and $463, respectively  |  27,768  |  26,604   \nInventories  |  42,968  |  52,306   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  3,483  |  4,879   \nAssets held for sale  |  —  |  2,912   \nCurrent assets of discontinued operations  |  56  |  861   \nTotal current assets  |  82,822  |  89,413   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  26,654  |  29,755   \nRight-of-use assets, operating leases, net  |  28,623  |  27,784   \nIntangible assets, net  |  7,380  |  8,496   \nDeferred income taxes  |  —  |  5,808   \nDeferred charges, net  |  29  |  104   \nOther non-current assets, net  |  3,108  |  1,935   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  148,616  |  $  |  163,295   \n**Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  12,286  |  $  |  16,416   \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities  |  7,081  |  5,108   \nCurrent portion of note payable  |  641  |  360   \nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities  |  1,448  |  1,140   \nCurrent portion of finance lease liabilities  |  288  |  292   \nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations  |  222  |  1,473   \nTotal current liabilities  |  21,966  |  24,789   \nLong-term portion of operating lease liabilities  |  30,433  |  29,729   \nLong-term portion of finance lease liabilities  |  1,089  |  1,307   \nDeferred income taxes  |  369  |  —   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  54  |  60   \nTotal non-current liabilities  |  31,945  |  31,096   \n**Total liabilities** |  $  |  53,911  |  $  |  55,885   \nCommitments and contingencies   \nShareholders' equity:   \nCommon stock, par value $1 per share;

(Nasdaq: ACNT) (“Ascent” or the “Company”), an industrials company focused on the production of specialty chemicals and industrial tubular products, is reporting its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary 1**  \n---  \n_(in millions, except per share and margin)_ |  **Q3 2024** |  **Q3 2023** |  **Change**  \nNet Sales  |  $42.9  |  $46.7  |  (8.2)%   \nGross Profit  |  $6.5  |  $3.0  |  116.5%   \nGross Profit Margin  |  15.1%  |  6.4%  |  870bps   \nNet (Loss)  |  $(7.0)  |  $(14.7)  |  (52.2)%   \nDiluted (Loss) per Share  |  $(0.69)  |  $(1.45)  |  (52.4)%   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $2.5  |  $(1.5)  |  262.8%   \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin  |  5.7%  |  (3.2)%  |  890bps   \n  \n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter marked another period of positive momentum as we generated our third straight quarter of improving results,” said Ascent CEO Bryan Kitchen. “Although market conditions remained soft across both segments, we continued to strip out unnecessary costs and operate more efficiently through aggressive self-help initiatives, leading to both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter improvements to our bottom line. We also made notable progress on the business development front within our specialty chemicals segment, which we believe will begin to show revenue growth in 2025 as we remain committed to unlocking the full potential of this segment. \n\n“Overall, we are creating a more predictable, reliable, and profitable operating model, as evidenced by our consistently improving results over the last three quarters. While demand across our end markets isn’t doing us any favors, I’m proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish so far this year in our efforts to stabilize the organization through recapitalizing SG&A, strict cost management, product line optimization, and dynamic pricing adjustments. These actions combined with our healthy balance sheet and no outstanding debt have us well positioned to finish the year on a positive note and move into 2025 with momentum at our back.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales from continuing operations were $42.9 million compared to $46.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decline was primarily driven by lower volumes and lower pricing as the Company fulfilled low-priced order backlog within the tubular products segment, along with lower volumes in the specialty chemicals segment partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix. \n\nGross profit from continuing operations increased 117% to $6.5 million, or 15.1% of net sales, compared to $3.0 million, or 6.4% of net sales, in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to aggressive cost management through improvements in product line management and strategic materials sourcing across both segments. \n\nNet loss from continuing operations improved to $7.0 million, or $0.69 diluted loss per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $14.7 million, or $1.45 diluted loss per share, in the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, the Company recorded a $6.2 million non-cash, one-time tax charge related to a valuation allowance against the Company’s deferred tax assets. Income from continuing operations before taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.5 million. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to the aforementioned increase in gross profit as well as a year-over-year decrease in interest expense due to lower debt outstanding. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased notably to $2.5 million compared to $(1.5) million in the third quarter of 2023, with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing significantly to 5.7% compared to (3.2)% in the prior year period. The improvement was primarily driven by the aforementioned cost and product mix optimization initiatives. \n\n______________________  \n---  \n1 On December 22, 2023, the Company closed on a transaction to sell substantially all of the assets of Specialty Pipe & Tube (“SPT”). As a result, financial results from SPT have been categorized into discontinued operations.   \n  \n**Segment Results**\n\n**_Ascent Chemicals_** _–_ net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 4% to $20.9 million compared to $20.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income in the third quarter improved significantly to $0.4 million compared to an operating loss of $(11.5) million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased 47% to $1.5 million compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of segment net sales, adjusted EBITDA increased 210 basis points to 7.3% compared to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**_Ascent Tubular_** _–_ net sales from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 were $22.0 million compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Operating income from continuing operations in the third quarter improved to $1.7 million compared to an operating loss from continuing operations of $(0.6) million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the third quarter increased significantly to $2.4 million compared to $0.2 million in the prior year period. As a percentage of segment net sales, adjusted EBITDA increased significantly to 10.7% compared to 0.7% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Liquidity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $8.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, no debt outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had $57.5 million in availability under its revolving credit facility. \n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 42,623 shares at an average cost of $9.79 per share for approximately $0.4 million. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nAscent will conduct a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nAscent management will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period. \n\nDate: Tuesday, November 12, 2024 Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time Live Call Registration Link: [Here ](https://register.vevent.com/register/BI99cb4bcdf5f44fd0be78d0554649e78f)Webcast Registration Link: [Here](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fedge.media-server.com%2fmmc%2fp%2fpfc783zj&c=E,1,XlNfdNCmXz0YP-ohJrzuQaBVOG6-ag0EsHas1oRI6gj2E820EAPL-L8wir18wvwd35w9xTaQSsH2JsFy0gp-ai9Ax5wGASgwAcAIhCZDeWnBHXD3Bxw,&typo=1&ancr_add=1)\n\nTo access the call by phone, please register via the live call registration link above or [here](https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fregister.vevent.com%2fregister%2fBI99cb4bcdf5f44fd0be78d0554649e78f&c=E,1,L3DVAkOugMjzh4DStLcQ6TMNnPurcHreNIHXP6H9cBbnCAEgmo01raqRnkkW2hSQiHg2kvrdlw-vRVm-R5mfMiBIwjA-8vyyFDGxAkk9ig,,&typo=1&ancr_add=1) and you will be provided with dial-in instructions and details.

All statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements can be identified through the use of words such as \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"should,\" \"anticipate,\" \"hope,\" \"optimistic,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"may\" and similar expressions. The forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and to review the risks as set forth in more detail in Ascent Industries Co.’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC or on our website. Ascent Industries Co. assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information included in this release. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Information**\n\nFinancial statement information included in this earnings release includes non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is useful to investors in evaluating its results to determine the value of a company. An item is excluded in the measure if its periodic value is inconsistent and sufficiently material that not identifying the item would render period comparability less meaningful to the reader or if including the item provides a clearer representation of normalized periodic earnings. The Company excludes in Adjusted EBITDA two categories of items: 1) Base EBITDA components, including: interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and 2) Material transaction costs including: goodwill impairment, asset impairment, gain on lease modification, stock-based compensation, non-cash lease cost, acquisition costs and other fees, shelf registration costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, retention costs and restructuring & severance costs from net income. \n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they are key measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions as well as allow readers to compare the financial results between periods. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as promulgated under GAAP, and investors should consider the Company's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. \n\n**Ascent Industries Co.**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n(in thousands, except par value and share data)   \n**(Unaudited)**  \n**September 30, 2024** |  **December 31, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  8,547  |  $  |  1,851   \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $583 and $463, respectively  |  27,768  |  26,604   \nInventories  |  42,968  |  52,306   \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets  |  3,483  |  4,879   \nAssets held for sale  |  —  |  2,912   \nCurrent assets of discontinued operations  |  56  |  861   \nTotal current assets  |  82,822  |  89,413   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net  |  26,654  |  29,755   \nRight-of-use assets, operating leases, net  |  28,623  |  27,784   \nIntangible assets, net  |  7,380  |  8,496   \nDeferred income taxes  |  —  |  5,808   \nDeferred charges, net  |  29  |  104   \nOther non-current assets, net  |  3,108  |  1,935   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  148,616  |  $  |  163,295   \n**Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable  |  $  |  12,286  |  $  |  16,416   \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities  |  7,081  |  5,108   \nCurrent portion of note payable  |  641  |  360   \nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities  |  1,448  |  1,140   \nCurrent portion of finance lease liabilities  |  288  |  292   \nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations  |  222  |  1,473   \nTotal current liabilities  |  21,966  |  24,789   \nLong-term portion of operating lease liabilities  |  30,433  |  29,729   \nLong-term portion of finance lease liabilities  |  1,089  |  1,307   \nDeferred income taxes  |  369  |  —   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  54  |  60   \nTotal non-current liabilities  |  31,945  |  31,096   \n**Total liabilities** |  $  |  53,911  |  $  |  55,885   \nCommitments and contingencies   \nShareholders' equity:   \nCommon stock, par value $1 per share;
