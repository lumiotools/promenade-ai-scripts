Reports Financial Results for the Third Quarter of 2024\n\nCompany Release -\n\n10/24/2024 4:15 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa, Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MidWest _One_ Financial Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: MOFG) (“we”, “our”, or the \"Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Third** **Quarter 2024** **Summary****1**\n\n  * Completed a common equity capital raise, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $118.6 million to facilitate a balance sheet repositioning. $140.4 million of securities impairment related to the repositioning was recognized in pre-tax earnings.\n  * Subsequent to quarter-end: \n    * Sold $1.0 billion of debt securities with a weighted average yield of 1.58%, and a weighted average life of 5.6 years.\n    * Purchased $589.8 million of debt securities, with a weighted average yield of 4.65%, and paid in full $418.7 million of Bank Term Funding Program borrowings with a weighted average cost of 4.77%.\n    * The estimated earn back period for the securities losses is 4.5 years.\n  * Recognized a net loss for the quarter of $95.7 million, or $(6.05) per diluted common share, reflecting the effects of the capital raise and balance sheet repositioning. Adjusted earnings were $9.1 million2, or $0.582 per diluted common share, which included a $1.2 million fraud loss related to a single incident.\n  * Net interest margin (tax equivalent) expanded 10 basis points (\"bps\") to 2.51%.2\n  * Annualized loan growth of 3.9%.\n  * Noninterest bearing deposits increased 4.0% from the linked quarter.\n  * Nonperforming assets ratio improved 8 bps to 0.39%; classified loans declined $14.5 million to $134.8 million; net charge-off ratio was 0.16%.\n\n\n\n**CEO Commentary**\n\nCharles (Chip) Reeves, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, \"Our successful common equity capital raise and balance sheet repositioning are significant, transformational steps towards our goal of creating a high performing company. We were pleased with the market receptivity of the oversubscribed common equity offering and the balance sheet repositioning financial results exceeded our communicated expectations. We are appreciative of our existing and new shareholders who supported this transformation and our team who executed the strategy so well.”\n\nMr. Reeves continued, \"We also kept our eye on the ball during the quarter, delivering positive results in a number of strategic initiatives. Our deposit franchise continues to show its strength as deposit costs rose minimally and our treasury management investments led to 4% linked quarter non-interest bearing deposit growth. Our commercial banking teams drove 4% annualized loan growth, improved asset quality, and good progress in our SBA lending and gain on sale initiatives. In addition, we continued to invest in our franchise, with both talent and technology, while maintaining expense discipline.\"\n\n_________________________1Third Quarter Summary compares to the second quarter of 2024 (the \"linked quarter\") unless noted. 2Non-GAAP measure.

Excluding the pre-tax securities loss of $140.4 million stemming from the balance sheet repositioning, total revenue for the third quarter was $47.5 million, a decline of $10.4 million from the second quarter of 2024 and an increase of $3.1 million from the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet interest income of $37.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 increased $1.2 million from the second quarter of 2024, due to higher earning asset yields and lower funding volumes, partially offset by lower earning asset volumes and higher funding costs. When compared to the third quarter of 2023, net interest income increased $2.9 million, due to higher earning asset volumes and yields, partially offset by higher funding costs and volumes. We expect net interest income to be higher going forward as a result of the balance sheet repositioning.\n\nThe Company's tax equivalent net interest margin was 2.51%3 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.41%3 in the second quarter of 2024, as higher earning asset yields more than offset increased funding costs. Total earning assets yield during the third quarter of 2024 increased 10 bps from the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to an increase in loan yields of 17 bps. Funding costs during the third quarter of 2024 increased 2 bps to 2.87%, due primarily to the 4 bps increase in interest bearing deposit costs to 2.58%, which was partially offset by a reduction in short-term borrowing costs and long-term debt of 10 bps and 4 bps, to 4.76% and 6.91%, respectively from the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Company's tax equivalent net interest margin was 2.51%3 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.35%3 in the third quarter of 2023, driven by higher earning asset volumes and yields, partially offset by higher funding costs and volumes. Total earning assets yield increased 58 bps from the third quarter of 2023, primarily from a 67 bps increase in loan yields. Funding costs increased 54 bps to 2.87%, due to interest bearing deposit costs of 2.58%, short-term borrowing costs of 4.76%, and long-term debt costs of 6.91%, which increased 53 bps, 47 bps and 13 bps, respectively from the third quarter of 2023.\n\n_________________________3 Non-GAAP measure.

The decrease in other revenue reflected the $11.1 million gain from the sale of our Florida banking operations in the second quarter of 2024 that did not recur in the third quarter of 2024. In addition, loan revenue decreased $765 thousand due to a $1.2 million unfavorable change in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by an increase of $0.4 million in SBA gain on sale revenue.\n\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 decreased $140.2 million from the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to the balance sheet repositioning-related securities impairment previously noted. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest income was a decrease in loan revenue stemming from the unfavorable year-over-year change in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, which was partially offset by an increase of $0.5 million in SBA gain on sale. Partially offsetting these decreases in noninterest income was an increase of $0.4 million in investment services and trust activities revenue, driven by growth in assets under administration and transaction fees, and an increase of $0.3 million in bank-owned life insurance due primarily to $0.2 million of death benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**EXPENSE REVIEW**\n\n**Noninterest Expense**|  Change| Change  \n---|---|---  \n3Q24 vs| 3Q24 vs  \n**(In thousands)**| **3Q24**|  2Q24| 3Q23| 2Q24| 3Q23  \nCompensation and employee benefits| **$**| **19,943**|  $| 20,985| $| 18,558| (5| )%| 7|  %  \nOccupancy expense of premises, net| **2,443**|  2,435| 2,405| —|  %| 2|  %  \nEquipment| **2,486**|  2,530| 2,123| (2| )%| 17|  %  \nLegal and professional| **2,261**|  2,253| 1,678| —|  %| 35|  %  \nData processing| **1,580**|  1,645| 1,504| (4| )%| 5|  %  \nMarketing| **619**|  636| 782| (3| )%| (21| )%  \nAmortization of intangibles | **1,470**|  1,593| 1,460| (8| )%| 1|  %  \nFDIC insurance| **923**|  1,051| 783| (12| )%| 18|  %  \nCommunications| **159**|  191| 206| (17| )%| (23| )%  \nForeclosed assets, net| **330**|  138| 2| 139|  %| n/m  \nOther| **3,584**|  2,304| 2,043| 56|  %| 75|  %  \nTotal noninterest expense| **$**| **35,798**|  $| 35,761| $| 31,544| —|  %| 13|  %  \n(n/m) - Not meaningful  \n  \n**Merger-related Expenses**  \n---  \n**(In thousands)**| **3Q24**|  2Q24| 3Q23  \nCompensation and employee benefits| **$**| **—**|  $| 73| $| —  \nOccupancy expense of premises, net| **—**|  —| —  \nEquipment| **—**|  28| —  \nLegal and professional| **127**|  462| 11  \nData processing| **—**|  251| —  \nMarketing| **—**|  —| —  \nCommunications| **—**|  8| —  \nOther| **6**|  32| —  \nTotal merger-related expenses| **$**| **133**|  $| 854| $| 11  \n  \nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was stable at $35.8 million, with increases of $1.3 million and $0.2 million in other expense and foreclosed assets, net, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily driven by a $1.2 million fraud loss related to a single instance recorded in the third quarter of 2024, while the increase in foreclosed assets, net, expense was attributable to a $0.3 million write-down and higher operating expenses of one other real estate owned relationship, partially offset by a $0.4 million gain on sale of a separate other real estate owned relationship. Partially offsetting these increases in noninterest expense were declines in all other noninterest expense categories, with the largest decrease in compensation and employee benefits, which stemmed from the sale of our Florida banking operations in the second quarter of 2024. Further decreases in noninterest expense categories were also driven by a $0.7 million decline in merger-related expenses.\n\nNoninterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 increased $4.3 million from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in all noninterest expense categories, except marketing and communications. The largest contributors to the increase in noninterest expense were increases of $1.5 million, $1.4 million, and $0.6 million in other, compensation and employee benefits, and legal and professional expense, respectively. The increase in other expense was primarily driven by a $1.2 million fraud loss recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in compensation and employee benefits expense was driven by annual compensation adjustments and increased incentive and commission expense. The increase in legal and professional expense stemmed from increased costs for legal fees, consulting, personnel procurement, merger-related expenses, and accounting and tax fees. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline of $0.2 million in marketing expense.\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate was 26.5% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 24.2% in the linked quarter. The increase in the effective tax rate reflected the impact of the investment security impairments recorded in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 and full year 2025 is expected to be 22-23%.\n\n**BALANCE SHEET REVIEW**\n\nTotal assets were $6.55 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.58 billion at June 30, 2024 and $6.47 billion at September 30, 2023. The decrease from June 30, 2024 was primarily driven by lower securities balances stemming from impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning, fair value adjustments recognized in connection with the re-classification of securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale, and scheduled calls, maturities, and paydowns, partially offset by higher cash and loan balances. Compared to September 30, 2023, the increase was primarily driven by assets acquired in the Denver Bankshares, Inc. (\"DNVB\") transaction, as well as higher cash and loan balances, partially offset by the sale of assets associated with our Florida banking operations, and lower securities balances.\n\n**Loans Held for Investment**| **September 30, 2024**|  June 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Balance**| **% ofTotal**|  Balance| % ofTotal| Balance| % ofTotal  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \nCommercial and industrial| **$**| **1,149,758**| **26.6**| **%**|  $| 1,120,983| 26.1| %| $| 1,078,773| 26.5| %  \nAgricultural| **112,696**| **2.6**|  107,983| 2.5| 111,950| 2.8  \nCommercial real estate  \nConstruction and development| **386,920**| **8.9**|  351,646| 8.2| 331,868| 8.2  \nFarmland| **182,164**| **4.2**|  183,641| 4.3| 182,621| 4.5  \nMultifamily| **409,544**| **9.5**|  430,054| 10.0| 337,509| 8.3  \nOther| **1,353,513**| **31.2**|  1,348,515| 31.5| 1,324,019| 32.5  \nTotal commercial real estate| **2,332,141**| **53.8**|  2,313,856| 54.0| 2,176,017| 53.5  \nResidential real estate  \nOne-to-four family first liens| **485,210**| **11.2**|  492,541| 11.5| 456,771| 11.2  \nOne-to-four family junior liens| **176,827**| **4.1**|  176,105| 4.1| 173,275| 4.3  \nTotal residential real estate| **662,037**| **15.3**|  668,646| 15.6| 630,046| 15.5  \nConsumer| **72,124**| **1.7**|  75,764| 1.8| 69,183| 1.7  \nLoans held for investment, net of unearned income| **$**| **4,328,756**| **100.0**| **%**|  $| 4,287,232| 100.0| %| $| 4,065,969| 100.0| %  \nTotal commitments to extend credit| **$**| **1,149,815**|  $| 1,200,605| $| 1,251,345  \n  \nLoans held for investment, net of unearned income, increased $41.5 million, or 1.0%, to $4.33 billion from $4.29 billion at June 30, 2024.

Partially offsetting these identified increases was a decline stemming from the sale of loans associated with our Florida banking operations.\n\n**Investment Securities**| **September 30, 2024**|  June 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **Balance**| **% of Total**|  Balance| % of Total| Balance| % of Total  \nAvailable for sale| **$**| **1,623,104**| **100.0**| **%**|  $| 771,034| 42.3| %| $| 872,770| 44.6| %  \nHeld to maturity| **—**| **—**| **%**|  1,053,080| 57.7| %| 1,085,751| 55.4| %  \nTotal investment securities| **$**| **1,623,104**|  $| 1,824,114| $| 1,958,521  \n  \nInvestment securities at September 30, 2024 were $1.62 billion, decreasing $201.0 million from June 30, 2024 and $335.4 million from September 30, 2023. The decrease from the second quarter of 2024 stemmed from impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning, fair value adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the re-classification of held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, and principal cash flows received from scheduled payments, calls, and maturities. The decrease from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the balance sheet repositioning executed in the fourth quarter of 2023, impairment recognized in the third quarter of 2024 related to the balance sheet repositioning, fair value adjustments recognized in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the re-classification of held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, and principal cash flows received from scheduled payments, calls, and maturities.\n\n**Deposits**| **September 30, 2024**|  June 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **Balance**| **% of Total**|  Balance| % of Total| Balance| % of Total  \nNoninterest bearing deposits| **$**| **917,715**| **17.1**| **%**|  $| 882,472| 16.3| %| $| 924,213| 17.2| %  \nInterest checking deposits| **1,230,605**| **23.0**|  1,284,243| 23.7| 1,334,481| 24.9  \nMoney market deposits| **1,038,575**| **19.3**|  1,043,376| 19.3| 1,127,287| 21.0  \nSavings deposits| **768,298**| **14.3**|  745,639| 13.8| 619,805| 11.6  \nTime deposits of $250 and under| **844,298**| **15.7**|  803,301| 14.8| 703,646| 13.1  \nTotal core deposits| **4,799,491**| **89.4**|  4,759,031| 87.9| 4,709,432| 87.8  \nBrokered time deposits| **200,000**| **3.7**|  196,000| 3.6| 220,063| 4.1  \nTime deposits over $250| **369,236**| **6.9**|  457,388| 8.5| 433,829| 8.1  \nTotal deposits| **$**| **5,368,727**| **100.0**| **%**|  $| 5,412,419| 100.0| %| $| 5,363,324| 100.0| %  \n  \nTotal deposits declined $43.7 million, or 0.8%, to $5.37 billion, from $5.41 billion at June 30, 2024.

Time deposits over $250 decreased $88.2 million from June 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a decline in public funds. Total deposits increased $5.4 million, or 0.1%, from $5.36 billion at September 30, 2023, primarily due to $224.2 million of deposits assumed in the DNVB acquisition, partially offset by $133.3 million of deposits divested as part of the sale of our Florida banking operations and a decline of $20.1 million in brokered deposits.\n\n**Borrowed Funds**| **September 30, 2024**|  June 30, 2024| September 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **Balance**| **% of Total**|  Balance| % of Total| Balance| % of Total  \nShort-term borrowings| **$**| **410,630**| **78.1**| **%**|  $| 414,684| 78.3| %| $| 373,956| 75.0| %  \nLong-term debt| **115,051**| **21.9**| **%**|  114,839| 21.7| %| 124,526| 25.0| %  \nTotal borrowed funds| **$**| **525,681**|  $| 529,523| $| 498,482  \n  \nBorrowed funds were $525.7 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.8 million from June 30, 2024 and an increase of $27.2 million from September 30, 2023. The decrease compared to the linked quarter was due to a decrease in overnight borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") and scheduled payments on long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in long-term FHLB borrowings. The increase compared to September 30, 2023 was due to higher Bank Term Funding Program borrowings, partially offset by lower overnight borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and scheduled payments on long-term debt.\n\n**Capital**| **September 30,**|  June 30,| September 30,  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**| **2024****(1)**|  2024| 2023  \nTotal shareholders' equity| **$**| **562,238**|  $| 543,286| $| 505,411  \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss| **(58,842**| **)**| (58,135| )| (84,606| )  \n**MidWest**** _One_****Financial Group, Inc.

Total shareholders' equity at September 30, 2024 increased $56.8 million from September 30, 2023, primarily due to increases in common stock and additional paid-in-capital stemming from the common stock issuance previously described and decreases in accumulated other comprehensive loss and treasury stock, partially offset by a decline in retained earnings.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.2425 per common share.

When compared to the same period of the prior year, the nonperforming loans and nonperforming asset ratios decreased 20 bps and 6 bps, respectively. The net charge-off ratio increased 11 bps from the linked quarter and increased 12 bps from the same period in the prior year.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $54.0 million and the allowance for credit losses ratio was 1.25%, compared with $53.9 million and 1.26%, respectively, at June 30, 2024. Credit loss expense of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 reflected an additional reserve taken to support organic loan growth, offset by a reduction of $0.3 million in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments.\n\n**Nonperforming Loans Roll Forward**| **Nonaccrual**| **90+ Days Past Due & Still Accruing**| **Total**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Balance at****June 30, 2024**| **$**| **24,695**| **$**| **433**| **$**| **25,128**  \nLoans placed on nonaccrual or 90+ days past due & still accruing| 6,426| 1,326| 7,752  \nProceeds related to repayment or sale| (7,761| )| (1| )| (7,762| )  \nLoans returned to accrual status or no longer past due| (500| )| (339| )| (839| )  \nCharge-offs| (1,609| )| (167| )| (1,776| )  \nTransfers to foreclosed assets| (549| )| —| (549| )  \n**Balance at****September 30, 2024**| **$**| **20,702**| **$**| **1,252**| **$**| **21,954**  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call for investors at 11:00 a.m. CT on Friday, October 25, 2024.

successfully to technological changes to compete effectively in the marketplace; (12) credit risks and risks from concentrations (by geographic area and by industry) within our loan portfolio; (13) the effects of competition from other commercial banks, thrifts, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market and

policies and practices, as may be adopted by state and federal regulatory agencies and the Financial Accounting Standards Board; (21) war or terrorist activities, including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, widespread disease or pandemic, or other adverse external events, which may cause deterioration in the economy or cause instability in credit markets; (22) the occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches, or failures of our or our third-party vendors' information security controls or cyber-security related incidents, including as a result of sophisticated attacks using artificial intelligence and similar tools; (23) the imposition of tariffs or other domestic or international governmental policies impacting the value of the agricultural

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates a\ntotal of five hundred twenty-five basis points in 2022 and early 2023, the largest and fastest increase in our banking lives.\nWarren Buffet’s famous quote of “when the tide goes out” quickly came to fruition and we saw the bank failures of Silicon\nValley, Signature and First Republic Bank in quick succession. All were highly concentrated institutions, with extreme levels\nof uninsured deposits, who exhibited poor asset/liability management.\nYour company, MidWestOne Financial, has an exemplary core, granular deposit franchise built over ninety years and a\ndiversified business model that stood the turbulence well. However, we were not immune to the interest rate cycle and our\nprimarily fixed rate loan portfolio and a too large, low yielding bond portfolio caused our net interest margin to decrease to\n2.46 percent by year end 2023, the lowest in company history. As eighty percent of our revenue is derived from the spread\nbetween our deposit costs and our earning asset yields, our net income was greatly reduced in 2023. We’ll discuss our\nfinancial results in more detail later in this letter.\nAmidst that backdrop, MidWestOne Financial was undergoing its own transformation. One where we honored the legacy\nand culture built by Dick Summerwill and Charlie Funk, yet one where we accelerated the pace of innovation and increased\nthe level of performance accountability as we strive to become a high performing company for all our stakeholders.\nIn late April, after months long ideation and data review, Executive Management and Board of Director engagement, our\ncompany unveiled its Strategic Plan, based on five Strategic Pillars, along with our 2023 Strategic Initiatives.\nWe developed the company’s first Vision Statement, for we needed to know who we are and who we aspire to be, which will\nstand alongside our long-held Operating Principles. Our Vision is “To be the pre-eminent relationship-driven community\nbank where our expertise and proactive approach generate meaningful impact for our stakeholders.”\nTo achieve our vision, we developed the following Strategic Pillars:\nExceptional Sophisticated\nStrong Core\nCustomer Commercial Specialty Improving our\nLocal\nand Banking Business Efficiency and\nBanking\nEmployee and Wealth Lines Operations\nModel\nEngagement Management\n2\nMidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. 2023 Annual Report\nExceptional Customer and Employee Engagement\nIn 2023, we commenced programs eliciting the voice of our customer across many of our business lines and we performed\nwell. We were rated over the industry average on the Primary Financial Institution (PFI) score at 75 percent. Additionally, we\nmeasured over the industry average at 84 percent in the Service Quality Index (SQI), and our Net Promoter Score (NPS) also\ncame in over the industry average at 54 percent.\nOur teams are also inextricably intertwined with the communities we serve, and our philanthropic donations totaled\n$1,365,470 across our footprint.\nWe are all about our employees and were incredibly proud to\nearn Top Workplace recognition in Iowa, Minnesota and the\nUSA for 2023!\nIn 2023, we also unveiled our MidWestOne Fundamentals, the\nbehaviors that bring to life, each and every day, our Operating\nPrinciples. These have served as additional connection to all\nour regions, team members and communities.\nStrong Core Local Banking Model\nOur deposits per branch of $90 million and our average account size of $30 thousand compare well to our peers and we\nhave many markets where we have 30-40 percent market share. The importance of this dynamic was seen as the coastal\nbanking crisis erupted in March and our local model fared quite well.\nWe will be increasing our community advisory boards in 2024, and we continued to decentralize decision making in 2023,\ngetting the decision as close to the customer and the community as possible. A concrete example of such is the hiring of a\nSenior Credit Officer based in our critical Dubuque, IA, market and now lending decisions up to $10 million are made in the\nlocal market by individuals with deep local knowledge.\nSophisticated Commercial Banking and Wealth Management\nWe are uniquely positioned to become the bank of choice for small-to mid-sized businesses (those with revenue up to $150\nmillion) and individuals with between $3-$25 million in investable assets.\nCommercial Banking was led by Executive Vice President Chase Stafford. In 2023, we added considerable commercial\nbanking talent in our major metro markets of Iowa, the Twin Cities and Denver, leading to 7.50 percent loan growth. Late in\n2023, we completely revamped our Treasury Management team and are now well-situated to compete for middle market\nbusiness. We have now developed the talent, products and processes to consistently achieve upper single-digit loan growth\non an annual basis.\nThe talent and product additions we made to our Wealth Management group in 2022 led to significant results in 2023,\nwith new Assets under Management of $195 million, a 60 percent yearly increase and revenue growth in that business\nsegment of 9 percent. In January 2024, we were pleased to welcome Steve Heimermann, Executive Vice President of Wealth\nManagement, as we look to his leadership to grow this business line at a double-digit pace in the years to come.\nLoans Held for Investment, Net ($MM)\n4,300.0\n4,100.0\n3,900.0\n3,700.0\n3,500.0\n3,300.0\n3,100.0\nFY2019 FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023\n3\nMidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. 2023 Annual Report\nInvestment Services and Trust Activity Revenue ($MM)\n13.0\n12.0\n11.0\n10.0\n9.0\n8.0\n7.0\n6.0\nFY2019 FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023\nSpecialty Business Lines\nMany high performing community banks have utilized a business model where specific expertise is developed in targeted\nindustries or products to drive customer acquisition, risk prudence and ultimately profitability. When this expertise is\ncombined with deep, personal, community-driven relationships, you win. This is the path your company began to develop in\n2023 with the formation of specialty groups in Commercial Real Estate, Agribusiness and Government Guaranteed Lending.\nWe look forward to the impact these teams will make to our company and our customers in 2024 and beyond.\nImproving our Efficiency and Operations\nOur company grew quickly, from $1.8 billion in assets in 2014 to $6.4 billion by the end of 2023. We needed to “mature”\nour company to keep pace with our asset growth. A team led by President and Chief Operating Officer Len Devaisher and\nChief Financial Officer Barry Ray identified numerous opportunities for improvement, the first of which was a geographical\nrealignment of our too-extensive footprint. In late September, we announced the divestiture of our Florida operations for an\nattractive premium and, almost simultaneously, the execution of a definitive agreement to scale our critical Denver market.\nThe Denver transaction closed in the first quarter of 2024, and we expect the Florida divestiture will occur in the second\nquarter of 2024.\nIn addition, as part of our strategic plan, we announced we would reduce expenses by 5.00 percent, while reinvesting 2.50\npercent of those savings back into the business. In this difficult operating environment where revenue growth is challenged,\nwe were pleased to exceed our objective. While maintaining expense discipline, we also reinvested in people and significant\ntechnology platforms, including Digital Account Opening, a Commercial end-to-end loan origination system and an\nindustry-leading fraud and anti-money laundering platform.\n2023 Financial Results\nAs discussed, the rapid interest rate increases in the 2022-2023 cycle had a dramatic impact on our net interest margin,\nand thus our net income. To counteract these trends, we undertook two separate balance sheet bond restructurings\ntotaling approximately $347 million in order to reduce our liability sensitivity and to improve future years earnings. We also\ncontinued to be disciplined in our loan and deposit pricing, with new loans averaging greater than 7.50 percent, while our\ndeposit costs increased less than peer banks.\nTotal Return\n260\n240\n220\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n12/31/2018 12/31/2019 12/31/2020 12/31/2021 12/31/2022 12/31/2023\nMidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. NASDAQ Composite Index S&P U.S. BMI Banks - Midwest Region Index\n4\nMidWestOne Financial Group, Inc. 2023 Annual Report\nDespite these actions, our net interest margin declined 46 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to our fixed rate loan\nand bond portfolios. Every basis point is equivalent to approximately $600 thousand of annual revenue, and as a result our\nnet interest income decreased $22 million. We expect our net interest margin to trough in the first half of 2024 and to slowly\nincrease thereafter, dependent on future Federal Reserve rate reductions.\nOur year-to-date return on average assets was 0.32 percent, and our return on average tangible equity was 6.14 percent.\nReturn on Average Assets (%)\n1.50\n1.00\n0.50\n0.00\nFY2019 FY2020 FY2021 FY2022 FY2023\nMOFG Peer Midwest Banks\nDespite the uncertain economic environment, asset quality metrics remained at peer group levels with net charge-offs at\nonly 0.09 percent of loans and non-performing asset ratio at 0.47 percent at year end 2023.
