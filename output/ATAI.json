Our team is focused on executing these trials with the utmost scientific rigor and is driven by our goal of being the leader in developing new psychedelic treatment options to mental health patients in need of innovative, safe and effective solutions.”\n\n**Recent Clinical Highlights** _VLS-01: N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) for Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD)_\n\n  * VLS-01 is a proprietary oral transmucosal film formulation of DMT applied to the buccal surface designed to fit within a two-hour in-clinic treatment paradigm.\n  * The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the investigational new drug (IND) application for VLS-01, allowing the Company to proceed with its plans to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to assess the safety, efficacy and durability of response of repeated doses of VLS-01 buccal film in patients with TRD.\n  * The Phase 2 study is expected to initiate the study in U.S. around year-end 2024.\n\n\n\n_EMP-01: R-enantiomer of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (R-MDMA) for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)_\n\n  * EMP-01 is an oral formulation of R-MDMA that demonstrated a unique, dose-dependent subjective effect profile in a Phase 1 trial that was generally found to be more similar to classical psychedelics than to racemic MDMA. \n  * atai expects to initiate an exploratory, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of EMP-01 in adults with SAD around year-end 2024.\n  * SAD is an area of high unmet medical need with approximately 18 million people in the U.S. diagnosed in the past year and no novel molecules approved in over two decades.\n\n\n\n_IBX-210: Intravenous (IV)-Ibogaine for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)_\n\n  * IBX-210 is a novel IV formulation of ibogaine, which is an indole alkaloid with potential for clinical benefit for substance use disorder\n  * Completed productive FDA pre-IND meeting to initiate discussions and alignment on a modern ibogaine IND.\n  * atai plans to run additional non-clinical studies prior to launching a Phase 1b study.\n\n\n\n_Novel 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists_\n\n  * Discovery program to identify novel, non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists for TRD using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-informed drug design and medicinal chemistry.\n  * Presented data at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) annual meeting aimed to show that these compounds are promising chemical starting points for new analogs with further improved 5-HT2AR vs. 5-HT2BR agonist selectivity that maintain translational antidepressant-like activity with potential for non-hallucinogenic effects. \n\n\n\n_RL-007: Pro-Cognitive Neuromodulator for Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia (CIAS)_\n\n  * RL-007 is an orally bioavailable compound that has demonstrated pro-cognitive effects in multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies, including two Phase 1 and two Phase 2 trials.\n  * The ongoing Phase 2b study is evaluating 20mg and 40mg of RL-007 vs. placebo in patients living with CIAS. Topline results are expected mid-2025.\n\n\n\n**Recent Corporate Updates** _Completed the acquisition of_ _IntelGenx Corp._\n\n  * IntelGenx is a drug delivery company focused on the development and manufacturing of novel oral thin film products for the pharmaceutical market and manufactures VLS-01 (buccal film DMT).\n  * Neither equity nor cash from the Company was used to acquire IntelGenx.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Upcoming R &D Catalysts**\n\n  * H2’24 \n    * VLS-01 TRD: Phase 2 initiation (around YE’24)\n    * EMP-01 SAD: Phase 2 initiation (around YE’24)\n    * BPL-003 alcohol use disorder (AUD): Phase 2a topline open-label data\n    * ELE-101 major depressive disorder (MDD): Phase 2a topline open-label data\n  * 2025 \n    * BPL-003 TRD: Phase 2b topline data (Q2’25)\n    * RL-007 cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS): Phase 2b topline data (mid’25)\n    * VLS-01 TRD: Phase 2 topline data (around YE’25)\n    * EMP-01 SAD: Phase 2 topline data (around YE’25)\n\n\n\n**Consolidated Financial Results** _Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term securities (primarily US treasuries and government agency securities):_ As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term securities of $101.0 million compared to $154.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease of $53.2 million was primarily driven by $58.1 million net cash used in operating activities, $10.0 million for the Beckley Psytech investment, and $7.7 million investment to advance our programs; partially offset by $16.1 million in proceeds from the partial sale of our ADSs holdings in Compass Pathway, and $5.0 million in proceeds from our committed term loan with Hercules Capital, Inc. The Company expects its cash, short-term securities, public equity holdings, and committed term loan facility to be sufficient to fund operations into 2026.\n\n_Research and development (R &D) expenses:_ R&D expenses were $12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $13.3 million for the same prior year period. The year-over-year decrease of $0.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease of $2.7 million in R&D personnel-related expenses, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in program-specific expenses. Within program-specific expenses, the increase was primarily driven by additional clinical trial expenses in the current year. The Company is anticipating R&D spend to increase as its R&D programs progress into later stage clinical trials.\n\n_General and administrative (G &A) expenses: _G&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were $10.3 million as compared to $13.6 million in the same prior year period. The year-over-year decrease of $3.3 million was primarily attributable to a $3.5 million decrease in personnel-related expenses and administrative costs. The Company expects the reduction in G&A spend over prior years to continue.\n\n_Net income (loss):_ Net loss attributable to stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $26.3 million, which included $2.0 million of non-cash change in fair value of notes receivables and other investments and $5.0 million of non-cash share-based compensation. Net income attributable to stockholders for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $44.2 million, which included a $69.0 million non-cash change in fair value of other investments related to an accounting change of our Compass Pathways plc investment and $8.3 million of non-cash share-based compensation.\n\n**About atai Life Sciences** atai is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders and was founded as a response to the significant unmet need and lack of innovation in the mental health treatment landscape. atai is dedicated to efficiently developing innovative therapeutics to treat depression, anxiety, addiction, and other mental health disorders.
