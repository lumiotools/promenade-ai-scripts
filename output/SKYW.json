Announces First Quarter 2024 Profit\nFirst Quarter 2024 Summary\n• Q1 2024 pre-tax income of $80 million, net income of $60 million, or $1.45 per diluted share\n• SkyWest took delivery of three of the 20 E175 partner-financed aircraft under a previously\nannounced agreement with United Airlines\n• Block hour production increased 5% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023\nST. GEORGE, UTAH, April 25, 2024 -- SkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKYW) (“SkyWest”) today\nreported financial and operating results for Q1 2024, including net income of $60 million, or\n$1.45 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $22 million, or $0.45 loss per share, for Q1\n2023.\nCommenting on the results, Chip Childs, Chief Executive Officer of SkyWest, said, “Our ability\nto meet our partners’ demand for additional production continues to increase as our captain\navailability has improved. We are also pleased with how our teams performed under challenging\nwinter conditions during the first quarter.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $804 million in Q1 2024, up $112 million, or 16%, from $692 million in Q1 2023.\nSkyWest’s block hour production increased 5% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, which\nreflects improvements in captain availability since Q1 2023.\nFor purposes of revenue comparability year-over-year, SkyWest recognized $1 million of\npreviously deferred revenue during Q1 2024 under its flying contracts, compared to deferring\n$63 million of revenue under its flying contracts during Q1 2023. As of March 31, 2024,\nSkyWest had cumulative deferred revenue of $366 million on its balance sheet.\nOperating expenses were $704 million in Q1 2024, up $7 million, or 1%, from $697 million in Q1\n2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the 5% increase in block hour\n1\nproduction year-over-year, offset by lower aircraft rent expense from early lease buyouts\nSkyWest executed during 2023.\nCapital and Liquidity\nSkyWest had $821 million in cash and marketable securities at March 31, 2024, down from\n$835 million at December 31, 2023.\nTotal debt at March 31, 2024 was $2.9 billion, down from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2023.\nCapital expenditures during Q1 2024 were $38 million for the purchase of spare engines and\nother fixed assets.\nUnder its previously announced share repurchase program authorized by the SkyWest Board of\nDirectors in May 2023, SkyWest repurchased 136,000 shares of common stock for $8.7 million\nduring Q1 2024 at an average price per share of $64.21.

GEORGE, UTAH, February 1, 2024 -- SkyWest, Inc. (NASDAQ: SKYW) (“SkyWest”) today\nreported financial and operating results for Q4 2023, including net income of $18 million, or\n$0.42 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $47 million, or $0.93 loss per share, for Q4\n2022. SkyWest also reported net income of $34 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the 2023\nyear, compared to net income of $73 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, for the 2022 year.\nCommenting on the results, Chip Childs, Chief Executive Officer of SkyWest, said, “Our teams\ncontinued to generate an exceptional product this quarter. Together, the SkyWest team\nachieved a record 300 days of 100% controllable completion in 2023. With improved pilot\nattrition and ongoing strong demand for our product, we are well set up for success in 2024 and\nbeyond. I want to thank our amazing team for their integrity, dedication and teamwork in\ndelivering the best product in the regional industry.”\nUnder its previously announced share repurchase program authorized by the SkyWest Board of\nDirectors in May 2023, SkyWest repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock for $45 million\nduring Q4 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SkyWest repurchased 10.6 million\nshares of common stock for $289 million, which represented 21% of SkyWest’s outstanding\nshares as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023, SkyWest had $91 million of\nremaining availability under its current share repurchase program.\n1\nFinancial Results\nRevenue was $752 million in Q4 2023, up $71 million, or 10%, from $681 million in Q4 2022,\nprimarily due to flying contract rate increases combined with 2% higher production in Q4 2023,\ncompared to Q4 2022. Additionally, SkyWest had $63 million of deferred revenue during Q4\n2023 under its flying contracts, compared to $70 million of deferred revenue during Q4 2022.\nSee the “Supplemental Cash Flow Information” section of this release for more information.\nOperating expenses were $724 million in Q4 2023, up $8 million, or 1%, from $716 million in Q4\n2022, driven by increases in employee compensation, including higher labor pay scales, and\nincreased maintenance costs, partially offset by lower aircraft rent expense from the early lease\nbuyouts on aircraft in Q1 2023. Additionally, for comparability purposes, Q4 2022 operating\nexpenses included a $36 million non-cash impairment on aircraft held for sale.\nCapital and Liquidity\nSkyWest had $835 million in cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2023, up from\n$820 million at September 30, 2023 and down from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2022.\nTotal debt at December 31, 2023 was $3.0 billion, down from $3.1 billion at September 30, 2023\nand $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022.

The United\nStates recently published a plan which outlines the commitment to action, and steps needed to achieve net-zero emissions in the\nU.S. aviation industry by 2050. While various measures, such as aircraft technology and operational efficiencies, will be required to\nachieve net-zero, the use of drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will be key. As outlined in the 2021 United States Aviation Climate\nAction Plan, “SAF produced from renewable and waste feedstocks will be critical to aviation’s ability to meet the net-zero goal.”\nThe graphic below is taken from the United States 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan and depicts how various measures can be\ncombined to reach net-zero emissions, namely new aircraft technology including innovative propulsion technologies, operational\nefficiencies, and SAF. While each lever will be necessary and applied to different degrees depending upon specific operator needs\nand opportunities, SAF is anticipated to play a prominent role to reduce in sector emissions. The SAF industry is still in an early\nstage of development, although the SAF Grand Challenge announced in 2021 intends to increase SAF production to at least 3 billion\ngallons per year by 2030 in the United States.\nANALYSIS OF FUTURE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL AVIATION CO\n2\nIndustry Initiatives & Progress\nAnalysis conducted by BlueSky leveraging R&D efforts from the FAA Office of Environment & Energy (AEE) regarding CO2 emissions contributions from aircraft technology,\noperational improvements, and SAF.\nSource: United States 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan, FAA, 2021\nSignificant commitments and progress to decarbonize the airline industry has taken\nSkyWest is committed to working with our major airline partners and industry to achieve these collective emissions reduction\nplace in recent years.
