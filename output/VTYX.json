(Nasdaq: VTYX) (“Ventyx”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing novel oral therapies that address a broad range of inflammatory diseases with significant unmet medical need, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and highlighted recent pipeline and business progress.\n\n“Thanks to the continued execution of our team, we are on track to initiate a Phase 2 trial of VTX2735 in recurrent pericarditis and a Phase 2 obesity and cardiometabolic trial of VTX3232 by the end of this year, in addition to advancing enrollment in the ongoing Phase 2a trial of VTX3232 in patients with early Parkinson’s disease,” **said Raju Mohan, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer**. “With our potential best-in-class NLRP3 inhibitors, we believe we are well positioned to unlock the vast therapeutic potential of the inflammasome pathway.”\n\n**_Pipeline Updates_**\n\n**NLRP3 Portfolio**\n\n  * **VTX3232 (CNS-penetrant NLRP3 Inhibitor)** : We initiated a Phase 2a trial of VTX3232 in participants with early Parkinson’s disease during the third quarter of 2024, with the primary goal of evaluating safety and key inflammatory biomarkers in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The trial also includes an exploratory endpoint of PET-tracer imaging as an assessment of microglial activation. We also expect to initiate a 12-week Phase 2 trial of VTX3232 in participants with obesity and additional cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors by year-end. This trial will evaluate the effect of VTX3232 on key inflammatory and cardiometabolic biomarkers as well as on weight change, when dosed as a monotherapy and in combination with a GLP-1 receptor agonist.These Phase 2 trials follow positive topline results from the Phase 1 single- and multiple-ascending dose (SAD, MAD) trial of VTX3232 in adult healthy volunteers. In the Phase 1 trial, VTX3232 exhibited a dose-dependent and dose-linear pharmacokinetic profile with repeat once-daily doses of VTX3232 exceeding steady-state IL-1β IC90 coverage in both plasma and CSF. We believe these data support the potential for VTX3232 as a best-in-class CNS-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitor for the treatment of neuroinflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases.\n\n\n  * **VTX2735 (Peripheral NLRP3 Inhibitor):** We expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of VTX2735 in participants with recurrent pericarditis by year-end, with the goal of evaluating safety and the effect of VTX2735 on disease-relevant biomarkers and pain scores. We believe that by treating and preventing disease recurrence, VTX2735 has the potential to become the first approved oral therapy for recurrent pericarditis, a debilitating autoinflammatory disease associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.We previously announced data from a Phase 2 trial of VTX2735 in participants with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), a group of rare autoinflammatory conditions caused by gain-of-function mutations in the NLRP3 gene. These proof-of-concept data demonstrated the therapeutic benefit of targeting NLRP3 in humans with evidence of strong efficacy and a favorable safety profile. We believe these results support the therapeutic potential of VTX2735 in recurrent pericarditis and numerous additional chronic peripheral inflammatory diseases.\n\n\n\n**IBD Portfolio**\n\n  * **Tamuzimod (formerly VTX002, S1P1R Modulator):** We recently presented new long-term extension (LTE) data from the tamuzimod Phase 2 trial in patients with ulcerative colitis at the United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week meeting in Vienna, Austria. These 52-week data continue to reinforce the potential best-in-class profile of tamuzimod in ulcerative colitis (UC) including a potential best-in-disease safety profile amongst all the oral options for UC therapy. We believe the high rates of clinical remission and endoscopic remission position tamuzimod as the backbone of future combination therapies. We intend to identify a partner or other source of non-dilutive financing to support the pivotal Phase 3 trial of tamuzimod in UC. \n  * **VTX958 (TYK2 Inhibitor):** As previously announced, VTX958 did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in CDAI (symptomatic outcome) in a Phase 2 trial in patients with Crohn’s disease, due to abnormally high placebo response. VTX958 did demonstrate robust, dose-dependent, nominally statistically significant endoscopic response rates at Week 12, as measured by SES-CD (an objective endpoint), and showed a greater magnitude of decrease compared to placebo in two key biomarkers of inflammation, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin. Recognizing the opportunity for a safe and effective oral TYK2 inhibitor as early-line therapy in Crohn’s disease, we are continuing the analysis of the Phase 2 data including data from the 52-week treat-through long-term extension phase to better understand the path forward for VTX958. At this time, we do not plan to commit significant internal resources to further development of VTX958.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $274.8 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund our planned operations into at least the second half of 2026.\n  * **Research** **and Development (R &D) expenses**: R&D expenses were $30.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $49.8 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) expenses**: G&A expenses were $7.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net loss** : Net loss was $35.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $54.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Ventyx Biosciences**\n\nVentyx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative oral medicines for patients living with autoimmune and inflammatory disorders.
