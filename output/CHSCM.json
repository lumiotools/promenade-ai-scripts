(the â**Delaware Action** â)(collectively with Plaintiff Ayers, â**Plaintiffs** â), all derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Community Health Systems, Inc. (â**CHSI** â or the â**Company** â); (b) defendants Thomas J. Aaron, W. Larry Cash, John A. Clerico, Michael Dinkins, James S. Ely III, John A. Fry, Kevin J. Hammons, Tim L.

Neither the Company nor CHSI stockholders will receive any payment from the Settlement. \n\n**_PLEASE NOTE_ : STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ANY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE. **\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE? \n\n1. The purpose of this Notice is to explain the Action, the terms of the proposed Settlement, and how the proposed Settlement affects CHSI stockholdersâ legal rights. \n\n2. The Action is a stockholder derivative suit. In a stockholder derivative suit, one or more persons or entities who are current stockholders of a corporation sue on behalf of and for the benefit of the corporation, seeking to enforce the corporationâs legal rights. In the Action, Plaintiff has filed suit against Defendants on behalf of and for the benefit of CHSI. \n\n3. The Court has scheduled a hearing to consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement and the application by Plaintiff in the Action, on behalf of all Plaintiffsâ Counsel, for an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses (the â**Settlement Fairness Hearing** â). See paragraphs 38-48 below for details about the Settlement Fairness Hearing, including the location, date, and time of the hearing. \n\n2 \n\nWHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED \n\nSO FAR? \n\nTHE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES. THE COURT PRESIDING OVER THE ACTION HAS MADE NO FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MATTERS, AND THIS NOTICE IS NOT AN EXPRESSION OR STATEMENT BY ANY COURT OF FINDINGS OF FACT. \n\n4. Plaintiffs allege that certain current and former officers and directors of CHSI breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Companyâs business, operations, and prospects related to the Companyâs provisions for bad debt and stating net operating revenue. \n\n5. On August 20, 2019, plaintiff Roger Trombley (â**Plaintiff Trombley** â), derivatively on behalf of CHSI, commenced the Action by filing a complaint against the Individual Defendants (ECF No. 1). \n\n6. On August 12, 2019, plaintiff Faisal Hussain, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Hussain v.

Clerico et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-02062 (the â**Roofers Action** â). \n\n9. On September 18, 2019, Kevin Aronson (â**Plaintiff Aronson** â) made a demand to inspect certain of the Companyâs books and records pursuant to 8 _Del. C._ Â§ 220. \n\n10. On February 7, 2020, the Company produced documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\n11. In March 2020, the Company completed its production of documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\n3 \n\n12. On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff Aronson, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Aronson v. Smith, et al._ , C.A. No. 1:20-cv-00587 (the â**Aronson Action** â). \n\n13. On February 24, 2020, the Court entered an Order which, inter alia, stayed the Action pending a ruling on defendantsâ then-forthcoming motion to dismiss a related securities class action pending before the Court and captioned _Padilla v. Community Health Systems, Inc. et al._ , C.A. No. 3:19-cv-00461 (the â**Federal Securities Class****Action** â) (ECF No. 22). \n\n14. On August 31, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , consolidated the Hussain Action, the Tanjavoor Action, the Roofers Action, and the Aronson Action, and appointed Plaintiff Aronsonâs counsel, Robbins LLP, as lead counsel in the Delaware Action. \n\n15. On September 30, 2020, the Delaware Plaintiffs designated the complaint filed in the Aronson Action as the operative complaint in the Delaware Action. \n\n16. On May 21, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order granting the voluntary dismissal of plaintiff Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund from the Delaware Action. \n\n17. On September 30, 2021, after full briefing by the parties, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , stayed the Delaware Action until after the Court issued a decision on the motion to dismiss pending in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n18. On August 17, 2022, the Court entered an Order in the Federal Securities Class Action denying defendantsâ motion to dismiss the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n19. On September 12, 2022, the United States Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , extended the stay of the Delaware Action until the resolution of all motions for summary judgment in the Federal Securities Class Action (or the deadline for making such motions passing without any such motion being filed), and allowed the Delaware Plaintiffs to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\n20. On September 20, 2022, the Court entered the First Modified Case Management Order (ECF No. 31) and Order Administratively Closing Case (ECF No. 32) which, _inter alia_ , administratively closed the Action, subject to a motion to reopen it, and allowed Plaintiff Trombley to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\n21. Thereafter, Plaintiff Trombley and the Delaware Plaintiffs, and subsequently Plaintiff Ayers, participated in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing the documents produced by Defendants in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action, developing their theories of liability, and preparing to participate in depositions taken in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n4 \n\n22. On October 13, 2022, the Court entered an order in the Federal Securities Class Action and in the Action directing the parties in the Action and the Federal Securities Class Action to meet in person and attempt to resolve a dispute regarding coordination of discovery between the Action and the Federal Securities Class Action (ECF No. 33). \n\n23. On December 9, 2022, Plaintiff Trombley made an unopposed motion for an order permitting Plaintiff Ayers to substitute in for Plaintiff Trombley as a representative plaintiff in the Action (ECF No. 34). \n\n24. On December 14, 2022, the Court entered an Order Substituting Plaintiff which substituted Plaintiff Ayers as plaintiff in the Action in place of Plaintiff Trombley and directed the Clerk to modify the docket and caption accordingly (ECF No. 35). \n\n25. On March 9, 2023, the Parties and the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action participated in a day-long, in-person mediation before Jed D. Melnick, Esq. of JAMS ADR. During the mediation, the Parties discussed resolving the Derivative Actions by means of certain corporate governance reforms that would be instituted by the Company. Although the mediation did not result in the settlement of the Derivative Actions, the Parties nevertheless continued to negotiate in good faith and exchanged iterative proposals of governance reforms in an effort to resolve the Derivative Actions. \n\n26. On March 14, 2023, the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action notified the Court that they had agreed to a settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n27. On May 30, 2023, the Court entered an Order granting preliminary approval of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n28. On June 20, 2023, after continued extensive armâs length negotiations, the Parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Derivative Actions in exchange for enhancements to the Companyâs governance and oversight over its compliance and audit functions, as set forth in detail in paragraph 31 below. \n\n29. After additional negotiations regarding the specific terms of their agreement, the Parties entered into the Stipulation on November 13, 2023. The Stipulation reflects the final and binding agreement among the Parties on the terms and conditions of the Settlement. The Stipulation can be viewed at the âInvestor Relationsâ portion of CHSIâs website, www.chs.net. \n\n30. On December 4, 2023, the Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to CHSI Stockholders, and scheduled the Settlement Fairness Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement. \n\nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT? \n\n31. In consideration of the full settlement and release of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims (defined in paragraph 34 below) against the Released Defendantsâ Persons (defined in paragraph 34 below) and the dismissal with prejudice of the Action, Defendants will cause the Company to adopt the following enhancements to the Companyâs governance and oversight over its compliance \n\n5 \n\nand audit functions, which shall remain in effect for no less than five (5) years except in the event that an unrelated entity, person, stockholder, or group of stockholders acquires all of the common stock of CHSI, enabling CHSI to terminate its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended with respect to its equity interests and to de-list from the applicable stock exchange: \n\n**I.** |  **BOARD DIVERSITY**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall utilize the âRooney Ruleâ for underrepresented populations when seeking candidates for nomination to the Board, wherein each pool of candidates considered for nomination to the CHSI Board shall include at least one (1) woman or one (1) member of an underrepresented group, thereby ensuring that members of these underrepresented populations are considered for nomination to the CHSI Board with appropriate consistency. \n\n**II.** |  **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EXPERT**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall retain an independent corporate governance expert to biennially perform an analysis of material corporate governance weaknesses for the next five (5) years.

Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel believe that the claims raised in the Derivative Actions have merit and that their investigations support the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. Without conceding the merit of any of the Defendantsâ defenses, and in light of the benefits of the Settlement as well as to avoid the potentially protracted time, expense, and uncertainty associated with continued litigation, including potential trial(s) and appeal(s), Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have concluded that it is desirable that the Derivative Actions be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel recognize the significant risk, expense, and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Derivative Actions against Defendants through trial(s) and through possible appeal(s). Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially complex litigation such as would be entailed by the Derivative Actions, the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation, the cost to the Company â on behalf of which Plaintiffs filed the Derivative Actions â and distraction to the management of CHSI that would result from extended litigation. Based on their evaluation, and in light of what Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel believe to be the significant benefits conferred upon the Company as a result of the Settlement, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have determined that the Settlement is in the best interests of Plaintiffs and the Company, and have agreed to settle the Derivative Actions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stipulation. \n\n33. Defendants deny any and all allegations of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damages whatsoever in the Derivative Actions. Defendants, to avoid the costs, disruption, and distraction of further litigation, and without admitting the validity of any allegations made in the Derivative Actions, or any liability with respect thereto, have concluded that it is desirable that the claims against them be settled on the terms reflected in the Stipulation. Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they committed any violation of law or duty or engaged in any wrongful acts whatsoever, including specifically those alleged in the Derivative Actions, and expressly maintain that they have complied with their statutory, fiduciary, and other legal duties, and are entering into the Stipulation and the Settlement to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further litigation. \n\n10 \n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED? WHAT CLAIMS \n\nWILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE? \n\n34. If the Settlement is approved, the Parties will request that the Court enter a Judgment Approving Derivative Action Settlement (the â**Judgment** â). Pursuant to the Judgment, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, the following releases will occur: \n\n**Release of Claims by Plaintiffs:** Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such, each of CHSIâs Stockholders (solely in their capacity as CHSI Stockholders), and the Company, as nominal defendant: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against each and every one of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against any of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons. \n\nâ**Released Plaintiffsâ Claims** â means all claims, causes of action, demands, suits, damages, and liabilities, including but not limited to both known claims and Unknown Claims, existing derivatively on behalf of CHSI or by CHSI, whether arising under federal, state, common, or foreign law, that (i) were asserted in the Derivative Actions or (ii) could have been asserted by the Company, or derivatively on behalf of the Company by a CHSI Stockholder, in the Derivative Actions or in any other forum, that arise out of or relate to the allegations, transactions, facts, matters, disclosures, or non-disclosures set forth in the operative complaints in the Derivative Actions as of the date hereof. The Released Plaintiffsâ Claims do not cover, include, or release any claims to enforce the terms of the Stipulation or the Settlement; any direct or class claims of Plaintiffs or any other CHSI Stockholders; any claims asserting violations of state, federal, or international antitrust law; or any claims based on conduct occurring after the date of execution of the Stipulation. \n\nâ**Released Defendantsâ Persons** â means Defendants, Defendantsâ Counsel, and their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, trustees, trusts, employees, Immediate Family Members, insurers, and attorneys. \n\n11 \n\nâ**Unknown Claims** â means any Released Plaintiffsâ Claims which any Plaintiff does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, and any Released Defendantsâ Claims which any Defendant does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, which, if known by him, her, or it, might have affected his, her, or its decision(s) with respect to the Settlement. With respect to any and all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims and Released Defendantsâ Claims, the Parties stipulate and agree that, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, and Defendants shall expressly waive any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law or foreign law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to California Civil Code Â§1542, which provides: \n\n**A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.**\n\nPlaintiffs and Defendants acknowledge, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that they may discover facts in addition to or different from those now known or believed to be true with respect to the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims, but that it is the intention of Plaintiffs, Defendants, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law, to completely, fully, finally and forever extinguish any and all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery of additional or different facts. Plaintiffs and Defendants acknowledge, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a material element of the Settlement and was relied upon by each and all of the Parties in entering into the Stipulation and agreeing to the Settlement. \n\n**Release of Claims by Defendants:** Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Defendants, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against each and every one of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons with respect to any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against any of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons. \n\nâ**Released Defendantsâ Claims** â means all claims, causes of action, demands, suits, damages, and liabilities, including but not limited to both known claims and Unknown Claims, whether arising under federal, state, common, or foreign law, that arise out of or relate in any way to the initiation, prosecution, settlement, or resolution of the claims in the Derivative Actions. The Released Defendantsâ Claims do not cover, include, or release any claims to enforce the terms of the Stipulation or the Settlement. \n\n12 \n\nâ**Released Plaintiffsâ Persons** â means Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel, and their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, trustees, trusts, employees, Immediate Family Members, insurers, and attorneys. \n\n35. By Order of the Court, all proceedings in the Action, other than proceedings necessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, have been stayed until otherwise ordered by the Court. Also, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be finally approved, the Court has barred and enjoined Plaintiff from commencing or prosecuting any action asserting any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons in any court or tribunal. \n\nHOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID? \n\n36. Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffsâ Counsel are entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses in connection with the Derivative Actions and the Settlement. Based upon the substantial benefits conferred upon the Company by the Settlement and the risks of undertaking the prosecution of the Action on a contingent basis, Plaintiffâs counsel intends to apply, on behalf of all Plaintiffsâ Counsel, for an immediate award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses in an amount not to exceed $1 million ($1,000,000) in the aggregate. \n\n37. The Court will determine the amount of any fee and expense award to Plaintiffsâ Counsel. Any Court-approved fee and expense award will be paid by or on behalf of CHSI. CHSI stockholders are not personally liable for any such fees or expenses. \n\nWHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING BE HELD? \n\nDO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAR AT THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS \n\nHEARING? MAY I OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT AND SPEAK AT THE \n\nHEARING IF I DONâT LIKE THE SETTLEMENT? \n\n38. You do not need to attend the Settlement Fairness Hearing. The Court will consider any submission made in accordance with the provisions below even if you do not attend the Settlement Fairness Hearing. \n\n39. _Please Note_ : The date and time of the Settlement Fairness Hearing may change without further written notice to CHSI Stockholders, or the Court may decide to conduct the Settlement Fairness Hearing by video or telephonic conference, or otherwise allow CHSI Stockholders to appear at the hearing by telephone or video, without further written notice to CHSI Stockholders. **In order to determine whether the date and time of the Settlement Fairness** **Hearing have changed, or whether CHSI Stockholders must or may participate by telephone or video, it is important that you monitor the Courtâs docket and the âInvestor Relationsâ**\n\n13 \n\n**section of CHSIâs website, www.chs.net, before making any plans to attend the Settlement Fairness Hearing.

Stockholder Derivative Litigation_ , Consol. C.A. No. 1:19-cv-01506-GBW (D. Del.) (the â**Delaware Action** â) (collectively with Plaintiff Ayers, â**Plaintiffs** â), all derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Community Health Systems, Inc. (â**CHSI** â or the â**Company** â); (b) defendants Thomas J. Aaron, W. Larry Cash, John A. Clerico, Michael Dinkins, James S. Ely III, John A. Fry, Kevin J. Hammons, Tim L. Hingtgen, William Norris Jennings, K. Ranga Krishnan, Julia B. North, Wayne T. Smith, and H. James Williams (collectively, the â**Individual Defendantsâ**), who are all of the named defendants in this Action and the Delaware Action (together with the actions consolidated therein, the â**Derivative Actions** â); and (c) nominal defendant CHSI (together with the Individual Defendants, theâ**Defendants** ,â and collectively with Plaintiffs, the â**Parties** ,â and each a â**Party** â). \n\n1 \n\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation and the approval of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee (the â**Court** â), the settlement embodied in this Stipulation (the â**Settlement** â) is intended to fully and finally dismiss with prejudice the Derivative Actions and compromise, settle, release, and resolve all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against the Defendants. \n\nUnless otherwise defined above or in the recitals below, all capitalized terms have the meanings ascribed to them in Section 1, _infra._\n\nWHEREAS: \n\nA. On August 20, 2019, plaintiff Roger Trombley (â**Plaintiff Trombley** â), derivatively on behalf of CHSI, commenced this Action by filing a complaint against the Individual Defendants (ECF No. 1). \n\nB. On August 12, 2019, plaintiff Faisal Hussain, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Hussain v. Smith et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-01506 (the â**Hussain Action** â). \n\nC. On August 29, 2019, plaintiff Susheel Tanjavoor, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Tanjavoor v. Smith et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-01617 (the â**Tanjavoor Action** â). \n\n2 \n\nD. On October 30, 2019, plaintiff Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Roofers Local No.__149 Pension Fund v. Clerico et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-02062 (the â**Roofers Action** â). \n\nE. On September 18, 2019, Kevin Aronson (â**Plaintiff Aronson** â) made a demand to inspect certain of the Companyâs books and records pursuant to 8 _Del. C._ Â§ 220. \n\nF. On February 7, 2020, the Company produced documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\nG. In March 2020, the Company completed its production of documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\nH. On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff Aronson, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Aronson v. Smith, et al._ , C.A. No. 1:20-cv-00587 (the â**Aronson Action** â). \n\nI. On February 24, 2020, the Court entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , stayed this Action pending a ruling on defendantsâ then-forthcoming motion to dismiss a related securities class action pending before the Court and captioned _Padilla v. Community Health Systems, Inc. et al._ , C.A. No. 3:19-cv-00461 (the â**Federal Securities Class****Action** â) (ECF No. 22). \n\nJ. On August 31, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , consolidated the Hussain Action, the Tanjavoor Action, the Roofers Action, and the Aronson Action, and appointed Plaintiff Aronsonâs counsel, Robbins LLP, as lead counsel in the Delaware Action. \n\n3 \n\nK. On September 30, 2020, the Delaware Plaintiffs designated the complaint filed in the Aronson Action as the operative complaint in the Delaware Action. \n\nL. On May 21, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order granting the voluntary dismissal of plaintiff Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund from the Delaware Action. \n\nM. On September 30, 2021, after full briefing by the parties, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , stayed the Delaware Action until after this Court issued a decision on the motion to dismiss pending in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\nN. On August 17, 2022, the Court entered an Order in the Federal Securities Class Action denying defendantsâ motion to dismiss the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\nO. On September 12, 2022, the United States Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , extended the stay of the Delaware Action until the resolution of all motions for summary judgment in the Federal Securities Class Action (or the deadline for making such motions passing without any such motion being filed), and allowed the Delaware Plaintiffs to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\nP. On September 20, 2022, the Court entered the First Modified Case Management Order (ECF No. 31) and Order Administratively Closing Case (ECF No. 32) which, _inter alia_ , administratively closed this Action, subject to a motion to reopen it, and allowed Plaintiff Trombley to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\nQ. Thereafter, Plaintiff Trombley and the Delaware Plaintiffs, and subsequently Plaintiff Ayers, participated in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing the documents produced by Defendants in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action, developing their theories of liability, and preparing to participate in depositions taken in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n4 \n\nR. On October 13, 2022, the Court entered an order in the Federal Securities Class Action and in this Action directing the parties in this Action and the Federal Securities Class Action to meet in person and attempt to resolve a dispute regarding coordination of discovery between this Action and the Federal Securities Class Action (ECF No. 33). \n\nS. On December 9, 2022, Plaintiff Trombley made an unopposed motion for an order permitting Plaintiff Ayers to substitute in for Plaintiff Trombley as a representative plaintiff in this Action (ECF No. 34). \n\nT. On December 14, 2022, the Court entered an Order Substituting Plaintiff which substituted Plaintiff Ayers as plaintiff in this Action in place of Plaintiff Trombley and directed the Clerk to modify the docket and caption accordingly (ECF No. 35). \n\nU. On March 9, 2023, the Parties and the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action participated in a day-long, in-person mediation before Jed D. Melnick, Esq. of JAMS ADR. During the mediation, the Parties discussed resolving the Derivative Actions by means of certain corporate governance reforms that would be instituted by the Company. Although the mediation did not result in the settlement of the Derivative Actions, the Parties nevertheless continued to negotiate in good faith and exchanged iterative proposals of governance reforms in an effort to resolve the Derivative Actions. \n\nV. On March 14, 2023, the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action notified the Court that they had agreed to a settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n5 \n\nW. On May 30, 2023, the Court entered an Order granting preliminary approval of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\nX. On June 20, 2023, after continued extensive armâs length negotiations, the Parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Derivative Actions in exchange for enhancements to the Companyâs governance and oversight over its compliance and audit functions as set forth on **_Exhibit A_** hereto (the â**Corporate Governance Reforms** â). The Parties did not begin to negotiate the amount of attorneysâ fees and expenses that Plaintiffsâ Counsel would request under Paragraph 15 below until after the principal terms of the Settlement, including the Corporate Governance Reforms, were agreed to. \n\nY. This Stipulation, together with the exhibits hereto, reflects the final and binding agreement among the Parties. \n\nZ. Plaintiffs brought their claims in good faith and continue to believe that their claims have merit, but based upon the investigation, prosecution, and mediation of the Derivative Actions by Plaintiffs and their counsel, each of the Plaintiffs and their counsel have concluded that the terms and conditions of this Stipulation are fair, reasonable, and adequate to the Company and its stockholders. Based on Plaintiffsâ direct oversight of the prosecution of the Derivative Actions and with the advice of their counsel, Plaintiffs have agreed to settle and release all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims as against the Released Defendantsâ Persons pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Stipulation, after considering _(a)_ the significant non-monetary benefits to the Company contemplated under the Stipulation; _(b)_ the uncertain outcome, inherent delays, significant cost to the Company, and significant risks of continued litigation; and _(c)_ the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of this Stipulation. \n\n6 \n\nAA. This Stipulation constitutes a compromise of all matters that are in dispute between the Parties. Defendants are entering into this Stipulation solely to eliminate the uncertainty, burden, and expense of further protracted litigation. Each of the Defendants denies any wrongdoing, and this Stipulation shall in no event be construed or deemed to be evidence of, or an admission or concession on the part of any of the Defendants with respect to, any claim or allegation of any fault or liability or wrongdoing or damage whatsoever, or any infirmity in the defenses that Defendants have, or could have, asserted. Defendants expressly deny that Plaintiffs have asserted any valid claims as to any of them, and expressly deny any and all allegations of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damages whatsoever. Defendants have further asserted and continue to assert that at all relevant times, they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in the best interest of CHSI and its stockholders. Similarly, this Stipulation shall in no event be construed or deemed to be evidence of or an admission or concession on the part of Plaintiffs of any infirmity in any of the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions, or an admission or concession that any of the Defendantsâ defenses to liability had any merit. \n\nBB. Each of the Parties recognizes and acknowledges that the Derivative Actions have been initiated, filed, and prosecuted by Plaintiffs in good faith and defended by Defendants in good faith, that the Derivative Actions are being voluntarily settled with the advice of counsel, and that the terms of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, and adequate. \n\nNOW THEREFORE, it is hereby STIPULATED AND AGREED, by and among the Parties through their respective undersigned attorneys and subject to the approval of the Court, that, in consideration of the benefits flowing to the Parties from the Settlement, all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims as against the Released Defendantsâ Persons and all Released Defendantsâ Claims as against the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons shall be settled and released, upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. \n\n7 \n\n**_DEFINITIONS_**\n\n1.

Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such, each of CHSIâs Stockholders (solely in their capacity as CHSI Stockholders), and the Company, as nominal defendant: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against each and every one of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against any of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons. \n\n8. Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Defendants, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against each and every one of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons with respect \n\n14 \n\nto any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against any of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons. \n\n9. Notwithstanding Paragraphs 7 and 8 above, nothing in the Judgment shall bar any action by any of the Parties to enforce or effectuate the terms of this Stipulation or the Judgment. In addition, nothing in Paragraphs 7 and 8 above is intended to release any rights to indemnification, insurance coverage, or advancement of expenses that any Released Person has or may have under any insurance policy, contract, bylaw, or charter provision, or under law, including, but not limited to, any rights any Released Person has or may have related to any pending or threatened civil or governmental proceedings. \n\n**_PRELIMINARY APPROVAL ORDER AND NOTICE_ **\n\n10. Within ten (10) business days of execution of this Stipulation, Plaintiff Ayers will move the Court for preliminary approval of the Settlement, authorization to provide notice of the Settlement, and the scheduling of a hearing for consideration of final approval of the Settlement, which motion shall be unopposed by Defendants. Concurrently with the motion for preliminary approval, Plaintiff Ayers will apply to the Court for, and Defendants will agree to, entry of the Preliminary Approval Order, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B. \n\n15 \n\n11. In accordance with the terms of the Preliminary Approval Order to be entered by the Court, no later than five (5) business days after the date of entry of the Preliminary Approval Order, the Company shall cause: (a) the Notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, to be published one time on Business Wire; (b) the filing with the SEC of a Current Report on Form 8-K (the â**Settlement Form 8-K**â), attaching the Notice, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, and this Stipulation; and (c) the posting of the Settlement Form 8-K and its attachments on the âInvestor Relationsâ portion of the Companyâs website, which shall remain posted thereto through at least the Effective Date of the Settlement. The Company shall pay or cause to be paid any and all Notice Costs regardless of the form or manner of notice ordered by the Court and regardless of whether the Court approves the Settlement, or the Effective Date of the Settlement otherwise fails to occur, and in no event shall Plaintiffs or their respective attorneys be responsible for any such costs or expenses. \n\n**_DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION_**\n\n12. If the Settlement contemplated by this Stipulation is approved by the Court, Plaintiff Ayers shall request that the Court enter the Judgment, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D, which will, among other things, finally approve the proposed Settlement and dismiss the Action with prejudice. \n\n13. Within ten (10) business days of such Judgment being entered, plaintiffs in the Delaware Action shall file a copy of the Judgment with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and seek as expeditiously as possible the dismissal of the Delaware Action with prejudice. \n\n**_ATTORNEYSâ FEES AND LITIGATION EXPENSES_ **\n\n14. Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffsâ Counsel are entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses in connection with the Derivative Actions and the Settlement. \n\n16 \n\n15. Counsel to Plaintiff Ayers will apply to the Court for an award of attorneysâ fees which the Company will pay or cause to be paid on its behalf. Counsel to Plaintiff Ayers will also apply to the Court for the payment of litigation expenses which the Company will pay or cause to be paid on its behalf. Defendants agree that they will not oppose or object to a request for an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses not to exceed $1 million (one million dollars) in the aggregate (the â**Fee and Expense Amount** â). \n\n16. Any Fee and Expense Amount that may be awarded by the Court shall be paid (or caused to be paid) by the Company into an escrow account designated by Plaintiffsâ Counsel within ten (10) business days after the Court enters an order awarding attorneysâ fees and expenses to Plaintiffsâ Counsel, subject to Plaintiffsâ Counselâs timely provision in writing (which may be in electronic means) to the Company of the requisite payment information, including wire instructions and a signed Form W-9 reflecting a valid taxpayer identification number for the account into which the Fee and Expense Amount is to be deposited. The Fee and Expense Amount, as awarded by the Court, shall be payable to Plaintiffsâ Counsel within such time period notwithstanding the existence of any timely filed objections thereto, or potential for appeal therefrom, or collateral attack on the Settlement or any part thereof, or the non-occurrence of the Effective Date. In the event that the Effective Date fails to occur for any reason, then Plaintiffsâ Counsel shall, within ten (10) business days after Plaintiffsâ Counsel receives notice of the non-occurrence of such Effective Date, return to the escrow account the entire Fee and Expense Amount. In the event that the order awarding the Fee and Expense Amount is disapproved, reduced, reversed, or otherwise modified by a final court order that is not subject to appeal or further review, Plaintiffsâ Counsel shall, within ten (10) business days after Plaintiffsâ Counsel receives notice of such final court order, return to the escrow account the difference between (x) \n\n17 \n\nthe Fee and Expenses Amount originally paid into escrow and (y) any attorneysâ fees and expenses ultimately and finally awarded on appeal, further proceedings on remand or otherwise. All returned amounts shall then be remitted as directed by the Company according to its written instructions. The escrow account and each Plaintiffsâ Counsel who receives any portion of the Fee and Expense Amount shall be subject to the Courtâs jurisdiction for the purposes of enforcing paragraph 16 or any other of the provisions herein related to the Fee and Expense Amount. \n\n17. Plaintiffsâ Counsel shall allocate the attorneysâ fees awarded amongst Plaintiffsâ Counsel in a manner which they in good faith believe reflects the contributions of such counsel to the institution, prosecution and settlement of the Derivative Actions. The Released Defendantsâ Persons shall have no responsibility for or liability whatsoever with respect to the allocation or award of attorneysâ fees or litigation expenses among Plaintiffsâ Counsel, or any other counsel representing Plaintiffs or any other CHSI Stockholder or any other counsel asserting a right to recover any portion of such award of fees or expenses. Any dispute regarding any allocation of fees or expenses among Plaintiffsâ Counsel shall have no effect on the Settlement. \n\n**_CONDITIONS OF SETTLEMENT AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION_**\n\n18. The Effective Date of the Settlement shall be deemed to occur on the occurrence or waiver of all of the following events: \n\n(a) the Court has entered the Preliminary Approval Order, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto; \n\n(b) Plaintiffs have not exercised their option to terminate the Settlement pursuant to Paragraph 20 below; \n\n(c) Defendants have not exercised their option to terminate the Settlement pursuant to Paragraph 20 below; \n\n18 \n\n(d) the Court has approved the Settlement as described herein, following notice to Company stockholders and a hearing, and entered the Judgment, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit D attached hereto without material alteration (or, in the event of material alteration, such alteration is consented to by the Parties in writing), and the Judgment has become Final. \n\n19. The Settlement shall not be conditioned upon the obtaining of, or judicial approval of, any releases solely between or among any of the Defendants and/or any third parties (which for the avoidance of doubt does not include the releases pursuant to Paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Stipulation). \n\n20. Plaintiffs (provided they unanimously agree amongst themselves) and Defendants (provided they unanimously agree amongst themselves) shall each have the right to terminate the Settlement and this Stipulation, by providing written notice of their election to do so (â**Termination Notice** â) to the other Parties within thirty (30) calendar days of: (a) the Courtâs refusal to enter thePreliminary Approval Order in any material respect; (b) the Courtâs refusal to approve the Settlement or any material part thereof; (c) the Courtâs refusal to enter the Judgment in any material respect as to the Settlement (other than as to any fee and expense award to Plaintiffsâ Counsel); or (d) the date upon which an order vacating, modifying, revising, or reversing the Judgment becomes Final, and the provisions of Paragraph 21 below shall apply. However, any decision or proceeding, whether in this Court or any appellate court, solely with respect to an application for an award of attorneysâ fees or litigation expenses shall not be considered material to the Settlement, shall not affect the finality of the Judgment, and shall not be grounds for termination of the Settlement. \n\n19 \n\n21. In the event the Settlement is terminated pursuant to Paragraph 20 above, then: (a) the Settlement and the relevant portions of this Stipulation shall be canceled; (b) the Parties shall each revert to their respective litigation positions in the Action as of immediately prior to the execution of this Stipulation; (c) the terms and provisions of this Stipulation, with the exception of this Paragraph 21 and Paragraphs 11, 16, 22, 24, and 43 hereof, shall have no further force and effect with respect to the Parties and shall not be used in the Derivative Actions or in any other proceeding for any purpose, and the Parties shall proceed in all respects as if this Stipulation had not been entered; and (d) the Judgment and any other order entered by the Court in accordance with the terms of this Stipulation shall be treated as vacated, _nunc pro tunc_. \n\n**_NO ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING_**\n\n22. Defendants have denied and continue to deny, _inter alia_ , that the Company suffered any damages alleged in the Derivative Actions, that Defendants acted in breach of their fiduciary duties or otherwise wrongfully in any way, and that the alleged harm suffered by the Company, if any, was causally linked to any of Defendantsâ actions or omissions. In addition, Defendants maintain that they have meritorious defenses to all claims alleged in the Derivative Actions. \n\n23. Nonetheless, Defendants have concluded that further litigation of the Derivative Actions, especially given the complexity of cases such as this one, would be protracted, burdensome, and expensive, and that it is desirable and beneficial to them that they secure releases to the fullest extent permitted by law and that the Derivative Actions be fully and finally settled and terminated in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation. \n\n24. Whether or not the Settlement is consummated, neither this Stipulation (including the exhibits hereto), nor the negotiations leading to the execution of this Stipulation, nor any proceedings taken pursuant to or in connection with this Stipulation, nor approval of the Settlement (including any arguments proffered in connection therewith): \n\n20 \n\n(a) shall be offered against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons as evidence of, or construed as, or deemed to be evidence of any presumption, concession, or admission by any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to the truth of any fact alleged by Plaintiffs or the validity of any claim that was or could have been asserted or the deficiency of any defense that has been or could have been asserted in the Derivative Actions or in any other litigation, or of any liability, negligence, fault, or other wrongdoing of any kind of any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons or in any way referred to for any other reason as against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons, in the Derivative Actions or in any arbitration proceeding or other civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, other than such proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Stipulation; \n\n(b) shall be offered against any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons, as evidence of, or construed as, or deemed to be evidence of any presumption, concession, or admission by any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons that any of their claims are without merit, that any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons had meritorious defenses, or with respect to any liability, negligence, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind, or in any way referred to for any other reason as against any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons, in the Derivative Actions or in any arbitration proceeding or other civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, other than such proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Stipulation; or \n\n(c) shall be construed against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons or the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons as an admission, concession, or presumption that the consideration to be given hereunder represents the consideration which could be or would have been recovered after trial; _provided, however_ , that if this Stipulation is approved by the Court, the Parties and the Released Persons and their respective counsel may refer to it to effectuate the protections from liability granted hereunder or otherwise to enforce the terms of the Settlement. \n\n21 \n\n**_MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_**\n\n25. All of the exhibits attached hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there exists a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Stipulation and the terms of any exhibit attached hereto, the terms of the Stipulation shall prevail. \n\n26. The Parties intend this Stipulation and the Settlement to be a final and complete resolution of all disputes asserted or which could be asserted by Plaintiffs against the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims. No Party shall assert any claims of any violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure relating to the institution, prosecution, defense, or settlement of the Derivative Actions. The Parties agree that the Settlement consideration and the other terms of the Settlement were negotiated at armâs length and in good faith by the Parties, including through a mediation process supervised and conducted by Jed D. Melnick, Esq. of JAMS ADR, and reflect the Settlement that was reached voluntarily after extensive negotiations and consultation with experienced legal counsel, who were fully competent to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their respective clientsâ claims or defenses. \n\n27. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel represent and warrant that: (a) none of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims has been assigned, encumbered, or in any manner transferred in whole or in part by Plaintiffs or Plaintiffsâ Counsel; and (b) neither Plaintiffs nor Plaintiffsâ Counsel will attempt to assign, encumber, or in any manner transfer, in whole or in part, any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims. \n\n22 \n\n28. While retaining their right to deny that the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions were meritorious, Defendants and their counsel, in any statement made to any media representative (whether or not for attribution) will not assert that the Derivative Actions were commenced or prosecuted in bad faith, nor will they deny that the Derivative Actions were commenced and prosecuted in good faith and are being settled voluntarily after consultation with competent legal counsel. In all events, the Parties and their respective counsel shall not make any accusations of wrongful or actionable conduct by any Party concerning the prosecution, defense, and resolution of the Derivative Actions, and shall not otherwise suggest that the Settlement constitutes an admission of any claim or defense alleged. \n\n29. The terms of the Settlement, as reflected in this Stipulation, may not be modified or amended, nor may any of said terms be waived except by a writing signed on behalf of all Parties (or their successors-in-interest).\n\n30. The headings herein are used for the purpose of convenience only and are not meant to have legal effect. \n\n31. The administration and consummation of the Settlement as embodied in this Stipulation shall be under the authority of the Court, and the Court shall retain jurisdiction for the purpose of: (a) entering orders providing for awards of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses to Plaintiffsâ Counsel and (b) enforcing the terms of this Stipulation. \n\n32. The waiver by one Party of any breach of this Stipulation by any other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any other prior or subsequent breach of this Stipulation. \n\n33. This Stipulation and its exhibits constitute the entire agreement among the Parties concerning the Settlement and this Stipulation and its exhibits. All Parties acknowledge that no other agreements, representations, warranties, or inducements have been made by any Party concerning this Stipulation and its exhibits other than those contained and memorialized in such documents. \n\n23 \n\n34. This Stipulation may be executed in one or more counterparts, including by signature transmitted via facsimile, or by a .pdf/.tif image of the signature transmitted via email. All executed counterparts and each of them shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument. \n\n35. This Stipulation shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Parties, including any corporation, partnership, or other entity into or with which any Party may merge, consolidate, or reorganize. It is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights or remedies upon any other person, except with respect to (a) any attorneysâ fees and expenses to be paid to Plaintiffsâ Counsel pursuant to the terms of this Stipulation; and (b) the Released Persons who are not signatories hereto, who shall be third-party beneficiaries under this Stipulation and entitled to enforce it in accordance with its terms, but the consent of such third-party beneficiaries shall not be required to amend, modify, or terminate this Stipulation. \n\n36. The construction, interpretation, operation, effect and validity of this Stipulation, and all documents necessary to effectuate it shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of laws, except to the extent that federal law requires that federal law govern. \n\n37. Any action arising under or to enforce this Stipulation or any portion thereof shall be commenced and maintained only in the Court. \n\n38. This Stipulation shall not be construed more strictly against one Party than another merely by virtue of the fact that it, or any part of it, may have been prepared by counsel for one of the Parties, it being recognized that it is the result of armâs-length negotiations between the Parties and all Parties have contributed substantially and materially to the preparation of this Stipulation. \n\n24 \n\n39. All counsel and any other person executing this Stipulation and any of the exhibits hereto, or any related Settlement documents, warrant and represent that they have the full authority to do so and that they have the authority to take appropriate action required or permitted to be taken pursuant to the Stipulation to effectuate its terms. \n\n40. The Parties agree to cooperate fully with one another in seeking Court approval of the Preliminary Approval Order and the Settlement, as embodied in this Stipulation, and to use best efforts to promptly agree upon and execute all such other documentation as may be reasonably required to obtain final approval by the Court of the Settlement. \n\n41. If any Party is required to give notice to another Party under this Stipulation, such notice shall be in writing, provided to counsel to the Parties set forth in the signature blocks at the end of this Stipulation, and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt of hand delivery or facsimile or email transmission, with confirmation of receipt. \n\n42. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall bear its own costs. \n\n43. Whether or not the Stipulation is approved by the Court and whether or not the Stipulation is consummated, or the Effective Date occurs, the Parties and their counsel shall use their best efforts to keep all nonpublic negotiations, discussions, acts performed, agreements, drafts, documents signed, and proceedings in connection with the Stipulation confidential. \n\n44. Nothing in this Stipulation, or the negotiations relating thereto, is intended to be or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege or immunity, including, without limitation, the attorney client privilege, the joint defense privilege, or work product protection. \n\n25 \n\n45. Subject to applicable Court rules, all agreements made and orders entered during the course of the Derivative Actions relating to the confidentiality of information shall survive this Settlement. \n\n**IN WITNESS WHEREOF** , the Parties have caused this Stipulation to be executed by their duly authorized attorneys as of November 13, 2023. \n\n**RILEY & JACOBSON, PLC** | **BARRETT JOHNSTON**  \n---|---  \n**MARTIN & GARRISON LLC**  \n/s/ _Milton S.

This Order incorporates by reference the definitions in the Stipulation and, unless otherwise defined in this Order, all capitalized terms used in this Order shall have the same meaning as set forth in the Stipulation. \n\n2. The Court preliminarily approves the Settlement on the terms set forth in the Stipulation, subject to further consideration at a hearing (the â**Settlement Fairness Hearing** â) to be held before the Court on _______________, 202__, at___:___ __.m., either in person at the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Fred D.

(the â**Delaware Action** â)(collectively with Plaintiff Ayers, â**Plaintiffs** â), all derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant Community Health Systems, Inc.

Neither the Company nor CHSI stockholders will receive any payment from the Settlement. \n\n**_PLEASE NOTE_ : STOCKHOLDERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE ANY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE. **\n\nWHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS NOTICE? \n\n1. The purpose of this Notice is to explain the Action, the terms of the proposed Settlement, and how the proposed Settlement affects CHSI stockholdersâ legal rights. \n\n2. The Action is a stockholder derivative suit. In a stockholder derivative suit, one or more persons or entities who are current stockholders of a corporation sue on behalf of and for the benefit of the corporation, seeking to enforce the corporationâs legal rights. In the Action, Plaintiff has filed suit against Defendants on behalf of and for the benefit of CHSI. \n\n2 \n\n3. The Court has scheduled a hearing to consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the Settlement and the application by Plaintiff in the Action, on behalf of all Plaintiffsâ Counsel, for an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses (the â**Settlement Fairness Hearing** â). See paragraphs 38-48 below for details about the Settlement Fairness Hearing, including the location, date, and time of the hearing. \n\nWHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED \n\nSO FAR? \n\nTHE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION AND THE SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN PREPARED BY COUNSEL FOR THE PARTIES. THE COURT PRESIDING OVER THE ACTION HAS MADE NO FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH MATTERS, AND THIS NOTICE IS NOT AN EXPRESSION OR STATEMENT BY ANY COURT OF FINDINGS OF FACT. \n\n4. Plaintiffs allege that certain current and former officers and directors of CHSI breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, failing to disclose material adverse facts about the Companyâs business, operations, and prospects related to the Companyâs provisions for bad debt and stating net operating revenue. \n\n5. On August 20, 2019, plaintiff Roger Trombley (â**Plaintiff Trombley** â), derivatively on behalf of CHSI, commenced the Action by filing a complaint against the Individual Defendants (ECF No. 1). \n\n6. On August 12, 2019, plaintiff Faisal Hussain, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Hussain v. Smith et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-01506 (the â**Hussain Action** â). \n\n7. On August 29, 2019, plaintiff Susheel Tanjavoor, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Tanjavoor v. Smith et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-01617 (the â**Tanjavoor Action** â). \n\n8. On October 30, 2019, plaintiff Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against the Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Roofers Local No.__149 Pension Fund v. Clerico et al._ , C.A. No. 1:19-cv-02062 (the â**Roofers Action** â). \n\n9. On September 18, 2019, Kevin Aronson (â**Plaintiff Aronson** â) made a demand to inspect certain of the Companyâs books and records pursuant to 8 _Del. C._ Â§ 220. \n\n10. On February 7, 2020, the Company produced documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\n11. In March 2020, the Company completed its production of documents in response to Plaintiff Aronsonâs books and records demand. \n\n3 \n\n12. On April 29, 2020, Plaintiff Aronson, derivatively on behalf of CHSI, filed a stockholder derivative action against certain Individual Defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned _Aronson v. Smith, et al._ , C.A. No. 1:20-cv-00587 (the â**Aronson Action** â). \n\n13. On February 24, 2020, the Court entered an Order which, inter alia, stayed the Action pending a ruling on defendantsâ then-forthcoming motion to dismiss a related securities class action pending before the Court and captioned _Padilla v. Community Health Systems, Inc. et al._ , C.A. No. 3:19-cv-00461 (the â**Federal Securities Class****Action** â) (ECF No. 22). \n\n14. On August 31, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , consolidated the Hussain Action, the Tanjavoor Action, the Roofers Action, and the Aronson Action, and appointed Plaintiff Aronsonâs counsel, Robbins LLP, as lead counsel in the Delaware Action. \n\n15. On September 30, 2020, the Delaware Plaintiffs designated the complaint filed in the Aronson Action as the operative complaint in the Delaware Action. \n\n16. On May 21, 2021, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order granting the voluntary dismissal of plaintiff Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund from the Delaware Action. \n\n17. On September 30, 2021, after full briefing by the parties, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , stayed the Delaware Action until after the Court issued a decision on the motion to dismiss pending in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n18. On August 17, 2022, the Court entered an Order in the Federal Securities Class Action denying defendantsâ motion to dismiss the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n19. On September 12, 2022, the United States Court for the District of Delaware entered an Order which, _inter alia_ , extended the stay of the Delaware Action until the resolution of all motions for summary judgment in the Federal Securities Class Action (or the deadline for making such motions passing without any such motion being filed), and allowed the Delaware Plaintiffs to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\n20. On September 20, 2022, the Court entered the First Modified Case Management Order (ECF No. 31) and Order Administratively Closing Case (ECF No. 32) which, _inter alia_ , administratively closed the Action, subject to a motion to reopen it, and allowed Plaintiff Trombley to participate in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action as provided therein. \n\n21. Thereafter, Plaintiff Trombley and the Delaware Plaintiffs, and subsequently Plaintiff Ayers, participated in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action by, among other things, reviewing and analyzing the documents produced by Defendants in discovery in the Federal Securities Class Action, developing their theories of liability, and preparing to participate in depositions taken in the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n4 \n\n22. On October 13, 2022, the Court entered an order in the Federal Securities Class Action and in the Action directing the parties in the Action and the Federal Securities Class Action to meet in person and attempt to resolve a dispute regarding coordination of discovery between the Action and the Federal Securities Class Action (ECF No. 33). \n\n23. On December 9, 2022, Plaintiff Trombley made an unopposed motion for an order permitting Plaintiff Ayers to substitute in for Plaintiff Trombley as a representative plaintiff in the Action (ECF No. 34). \n\n24. On December 14, 2022, the Court entered an Order Substituting Plaintiff which substituted Plaintiff Ayers as plaintiff in the Action in place of Plaintiff Trombley and directed the Clerk to modify the docket and caption accordingly (ECF No. 35). \n\n25. On March 9, 2023, the Parties and the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action participated in a day-long, in-person mediation before Jed D. Melnick, Esq. of JAMS ADR. During the mediation, the Parties discussed resolving the Derivative Actions by means of certain corporate governance reforms that would be instituted by the Company. Although the mediation did not result in the settlement of the Derivative Actions, the Parties nevertheless continued to negotiate in good faith and exchanged iterative proposals of governance reforms in an effort to resolve the Derivative Actions. \n\n26. On March 14, 2023, the parties to the Federal Securities Class Action notified the Court that they had agreed to a settlement of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n27. On May 30, 2023, the Court entered an Order granting preliminary approval of the Federal Securities Class Action. \n\n28. On June 20, 2023, after continued extensive armâs length negotiations, the Parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the Derivative Actions in exchange for enhancements to the Companyâs governance and oversight over its compliance and audit functions, as set forth in detail in paragraph 31 below. \n\n29. After additional negotiations regarding the specific terms of their agreement, the Parties entered into the Stipulation on November 13, 2023. The Stipulation reflects the final and binding agreement among the Parties on the terms and conditions of the Settlement. The Stipulation can be viewed at the âInvestor Relationsâ portion of CHSIâs website, www.chs.net. \n\n30. On [_____________], 2023, the Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, authorized this Notice to be provided to CHSI Stockholders, and scheduled the Settlement Fairness Hearing to consider whether to grant final approval of the Settlement. \n\nWHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT? \n\n31. In consideration of the full settlement and release of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims (defined in paragraph 34 below) against the Released Defendantsâ Persons (defined in paragraph 34 below) and the dismissal with prejudice of the Action, Defendants will cause the Company to adopt the following enhancements to the Companyâs governance and oversight over its compliance \n\n5 \n\nand audit functions, which shall remain in effect for no less than five (5) years except in the event that an unrelated entity, person, stockholder, or group of stockholders acquires all of the common stock of CHSI, enabling CHSI to terminate its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended with respect to its equity interests and to de-list from the applicable stock exchange: \n\n**I.** |  **BOARD DIVERSITY**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall utilize the âRooney Ruleâ for underrepresented populations when seeking candidates for nomination to the Board, wherein each pool of candidates considered for nomination to the CHSI Board shall include at least one (1) woman or one (1) member of an underrepresented group, thereby ensuring that members of these underrepresented populations are considered for nomination to the CHSI Board with appropriate consistency. \n\n**II.** |  **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EXPERT**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall retain an independent corporate governance expert to biennially perform an analysis of material corporate governance weaknesses for the next five (5) years.

Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel believe that the claims raised in the Derivative Actions have merit and that their investigations support the claims asserted in the Derivative Actions. Without conceding the merit of any of the Defendantsâ defenses, and in light of the benefits of the Settlement as well as to avoid the potentially protracted time, expense, and uncertainty associated with continued litigation, including potential trial(s) and appeal(s), Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have concluded that it is desirable that the Derivative Actions be fully and finally settled in the manner and upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Stipulation. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel recognize the significant risk, expense, and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Derivative Actions against Defendants through trial(s) and through possible appeal(s). Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially complex litigation such as would be entailed by the Derivative Actions, the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation, the cost to the Company â on behalf of which Plaintiffs filed the Derivative Actions â and distraction to the management of CHSI that would result from extended litigation. Based on their evaluation, and in light of what Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel believe to be the significant benefits conferred upon the Company as a result of the Settlement, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel have determined that the Settlement is in the best interests of Plaintiffs and the Company, and have agreed to settle the Derivative Actions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Stipulation. \n\n33. Defendants deny any and all allegations of fault, liability, wrongdoing, or damages whatsoever in the Derivative Actions. Defendants, to avoid the costs, disruption, and distraction of further litigation, and without admitting the validity of any allegations made in the Derivative Actions, or any liability with respect thereto, have concluded that it is desirable that the claims against them be settled on the terms reflected in the Stipulation. Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, that they committed any violation of law or duty or engaged in any wrongful acts whatsoever, including specifically those alleged in the Derivative Actions, and expressly maintain that they have complied with their statutory, fiduciary, and other legal duties, and are entering into the Stipulation and the Settlement to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further litigation. \n\n10 \n\nWHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROVED? WHAT CLAIMS WILL THE SETTLEMENT RELEASE? \n\n34. If the Settlement is approved, the Parties will request that the Court enter a Judgment Approving Derivative Action Settlement (the â**Judgment** â). Pursuant to the Judgment, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, the following releases will occur: \n\n**Release of Claims by Plaintiffs:** Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such, each of CHSIâs Stockholders (solely in their capacity as CHSI Stockholders), and the Company, as nominal defendant: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against each and every one of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against any of the Defendants and the other Released Defendantsâ Persons. \n\nâ**Released Plaintiffsâ Claims** â means all claims, causes of action, demands, suits, damages, and liabilities, including but not limited to both known claims and Unknown Claims, existing derivatively on behalf of CHSI or by CHSI, whether arising under federal, state, common, or foreign law, that (i) were asserted in the Derivative Actions or (ii) could have been asserted by the Company, or derivatively on behalf of the Company by a CHSI Stockholder, in the Derivative Actions or in any other forum, that arise out of or relate to the allegations, transactions, facts, matters, disclosures, or non-disclosures set forth in the operative complaints in the Derivative Actions as of the date hereof. The Released Plaintiffsâ Claims do not cover, include, or release any claims to enforce the terms of the Stipulation or the Settlement; any direct or class claims of Plaintiffs or any other CHSI Stockholders; any claims asserting violations of state, federal, or international antitrust law; or any claims based on conduct occurring after the date of execution of the Stipulation. \n\nâ**Released Defendantsâ Persons** â means Defendants, Defendantsâ Counsel, and their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, trustees, trusts, employees, Immediate Family Members, insurers, and attorneys. \n\n11 \n\nâ**Unknown Claims** â means any Released Plaintiffsâ Claims which any Plaintiff does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, and any Released Defendantsâ Claims which any Defendant does not know or suspect to exist in his, her, or its favor at the time of the release of such claims, which, if known by him, her, or it, might have affected his, her, or its decision(s) with respect to the Settlement. With respect to any and all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims and Released Defendantsâ Claims, the Parties stipulate and agree that, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Plaintiffs, and Defendants shall expressly waive any and all provisions, rights, and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law or foreign law, which is similar, comparable, or equivalent to California Civil Code Â§1542, which provides: \n\n**A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.**\n\nPlaintiffs and Defendants acknowledge, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that they may discover facts in addition to or different from those now known or believed to be true with respect to the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims, but that it is the intention of Plaintiffs, Defendants, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law, to completely, fully, finally and forever extinguish any and all Released Plaintiffsâ Claims without regard to the subsequent discovery of additional or different facts. Plaintiffs and Defendants acknowledge, and all other CHSI Stockholders by operation of law shall be deemed to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a material element of the Settlement and was relied upon by each and all of the Parties in entering into the Stipulation and agreeing to the Settlement. \n\n**Release of Claims by Defendants:** Pursuant to the Judgment, without further action by anyone, upon the Effective Date of the Settlement, Defendants, on behalf of themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, predecessors, successors, and assigns, in their capacities as such: (i) shall be deemed to have, and by operation of law and of the Judgment, shall have, fully, finally, and forever compromised, settled, released, resolved, relinquished, waived, discharged, and dismissed each and every one of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against each and every one of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons; (ii) shall by operation of law and of the Judgment have covenanted not to sue, directly or indirectly, any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons with respect to any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims; and (iii) shall forever be barred and enjoined from directly or indirectly initiating, prosecuting, facilitating, filing, commencing, instituting, maintaining, assisting in, or intervening in any action, suit, cause of action, arbitration, claim, demand, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction, on their own behalf or in a representative capacity, that is based upon or arises out of any or all of the Released Defendantsâ Claims against any of the Plaintiffs and the other Released Plaintiffsâ Persons. \n\nâ**Released Defendantsâ Claims** â means all claims, causes of action, demands, suits, damages, and liabilities, including but not limited to both known claims and Unknown Claims, whether arising under federal, state, common, or foreign law, that arise out of or relate in any way to the initiation, prosecution, settlement, or resolution of the claims in the Derivative Actions. The Released Defendantsâ Claims do not cover, include, or release any claims to enforce the terms of the Stipulation or the Settlement. \n\n12 \n\nâ**Released Plaintiffsâ Persons** â means Plaintiffs and Plaintiffsâ Counsel, and their respective current and former parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, agents, successors, predecessors, assigns, assignees, partnerships, partners, trustees, trusts, employees, Immediate Family Members, insurers, and attorneys. \n\n35. By Order of the Court, all proceedings in the Action, other than proceedings necessary to carry out or enforce the terms and conditions of the Stipulation, have been stayed until otherwise ordered by the Court. Also, pending final determination of whether the Settlement should be finally approved, the Court has barred and enjoined Plaintiff from commencing or prosecuting any action asserting any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Claims against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons in any court or tribunal. \n\nHOW WILL THE ATTORNEYS BE PAID? \n\n36. Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiffsâ Counsel are entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses in connection with the Derivative Actions and the Settlement. Based upon the substantial benefits conferred upon the Company by the Settlement and the risks of undertaking the prosecution of the Action on a contingent basis, Plaintiffâs counsel intends to apply, on behalf of all Plaintiffsâ Counsel, for an immediate award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses in an amount not to exceed $1 million ($1,000,000) in the aggregate. \n\n37. The Court will determine the amount of any fee and expense award to Plaintiffsâ Counsel. Any Court-approved fee and expense award will be paid by or on behalf of CHSI. CHSI stockholders are not personally liable for any such fees or expenses. \n\nWHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING BE HELD? \n\nDO I HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAR AT THE SETTLEMENT FAIRNESS HEARING? MAY I OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT AND SPEAK AT THE HEARING IF I DONâT LIKE THE SETTLEMENT? \n\n38. You do not need to attend the Settlement Fairness Hearing.

Notwithstanding Paragraphs 8-9 above, nothing in this Judgment shall bar any action by any of the Parties to enforce or effectuate the terms of the Stipulation or this Judgment. \n\n11. Whether or not the Settlement is consummated, neither this Judgment, nor the Stipulation (including the exhibits thereto), nor the negotiations leading to the execution of the Stipulation, nor any proceedings taken pursuant to or in connection with the Stipulation, nor approval of the Settlement (including any arguments proffered in connection therewith): \n\n5 \n\n(a) shall be offered against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons as evidence of, or construed as, or deemed to be evidence of any presumption, concession, or admission by any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons with respect to the truth of any fact alleged by Plaintiffs or the validity of any claim that was or could have been asserted or the deficiency of any defense that has been or could have been asserted in the Action or in any other litigation, or of any liability, negligence, fault, or other wrongdoing of any kind of any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons or in any way referred to for any other reason as against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons, in this Action or in any arbitration proceeding or other civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, other than such proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of the Stipulation; \n\n(b) shall be offered against any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons, as evidence of, or construed as, or deemed to be evidence of any presumption, concession, or admission by any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons that any of their claims are without merit, that any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons had meritorious defenses, or with respect to any liability, negligence, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind, or in any way referred to for any other reason as against any of the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons, in this Action or in any arbitration proceeding or other civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, other than such proceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of the Stipulation; or \n\n(c) shall be construed against any of the Released Defendantsâ Persons or the Released Plaintiffsâ Persons as an admission, concession, or presumption that the consideration to be given hereunder represents the consideration which could be or would have been recovered after trial; _provided, however_ , that the Parties and the Released Persons and their respective counsel may refer to the Stipulation and this Judgment to effectuate the protections from liability granted thereunder or hereunder or otherwise to enforce the terms of the Settlement. \n\n6 \n\n12. The Court hereby approves the sum of $_________________ for the payment of Plaintiffsâ Counselâs attorneysâ fees and expenses in the Derivative Actions, which sum the Court finds to be fair and reasonable. Plaintiffsâ Counsel shall allocate the attorneysâ fees awarded amongst Plaintiffsâ Counsel in a manner which they, in good faith, believe reflects the contributions of such counsel to the institution, prosecution, and settlement of the Derivative Actions. \n\n13. The effectiveness of this Judgment and the obligations of the Parties under the Settlement shall not be conditioned upon or subject to the resolution of any appeal or other matter, court order, or proceeding that relates solely to the award of attorneysâ fees and litigation expenses to Plaintiffsâ Counsel. \n\n14. The parties to the Action have represented that the Action was filed, prosecuted, defended, and settled in good faith, and that during the course of the Action, the parties to the Action and their respective counsel at all times complied with the requirements of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and all similar rules and laws. \n\n15. Without affecting the finality of this Judgment in any way, the Court hereby retains continuing jurisdiction over: (i) implementation of the Settlement; and (ii) the parties to the Action and all CHSI Stockholders for the purpose of construing, enforcing, and administering the Stipulation and the Settlement. \n\n16. Without further approval from the Court, the Parties are hereby authorized to agree to and adopt such amendments or modifications of the Stipulation or any exhibits attached thereto to effectuate the Settlement that are not materially inconsistent with this Judgment. Without further order of the Court, the Parties may agree to reasonable extensions of time to carry out any provisions of the Settlement. \n\n7 \n\n17. If the Settlement is terminated as provided in the Stipulation or the Effective Date of the Settlement otherwise fails to occur, this Judgment shall be vacated, rendered null and void, and be of no further force and effect, except as otherwise provided by the Stipulation, and this Judgment shall be without prejudice to the rights of Plaintiffs, Defendants, and the Company, and the Parties shall each revert to their respective litigation positions in the Action as of immediately prior to the execution of the Stipulation. \n\n18. The Parties are hereby authorized and directed to comply with and to consummate the Settlement in accordance with its terms and provisions, and the Clerk is directed to enter and docket this Judgment in the Action. The Court finds that this Judgment is a final judgment and should be entered in accordance with Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n\nSO ORDERED this _____day of ____________, 202__. \n\nThe Honorable Eli J.
