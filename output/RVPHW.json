(NASDAQ: RVPH) (“Reviva” or the “Company”), a late-stage pharmaceutical company developing therapies that seek to address unmet medical needs in the areas of central nervous system (CNS), inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and summarized recent business highlights.\n\n“We continue to advance our late-stage brilaroxazine program with initial focus in schizophrenia and expansion potential across indications driven by underlying disruption in serotonin signaling,” said Laxminarayan Bhat, Ph.D., Founder, President, and CEO of Reviva. “Our global 1-year OLE trial is progressing well, and we have over 100 patients who have completed one year of treatment which is a requirement for New Drug Application (NDA) submission. Importantly, we expect topline data from the OLE trial in December 2024. In addition to long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy, the full data analysis of the OLE trial expected in the first quarter of 2025 will also include vocal and blood biomarker data designed to support the strong efficacy of brilaroxazine for negative symptoms and other key symptom domains of schizophrenia. We remain highly encouraged by the differentiated potential of once-daily brilaroxazine to address major unmet needs for patients with schizophrenia and are targeting a potential NDA submission for brilaroxazine in the second quarter of 2026.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**Clinical Program Highlights**\n\n  * Provided an enrollment update to the ongoing 1-year open-label extension (OLE) study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of brilaroxazine in patients with schizophrenia (November 2024). \n    * Global trial progressing well\n    * 108 patients have completed 1-year (12-month) of treatment\n    * Over 250 patients have completed 6-months of treatment\n    * Blood and digital biomarkers designed to independently support efficacy\n    * Long-term safety data from 100 patients who have completed 12 months of treatment is a requirement for brilaroxazine’s NDA submission to the FDA\n    * 12 months long-term safety study expected to complete in Q1 2025\n  * Presented vocal biomarker data from Phase 3 RECOVER trial of brilaroxazine in schizophrenia during a virtual key opinion leader event hosted by the Company featuring Brian Kirkpatrick, MD, MSPH (Professor, Psychiatric Research Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Arkansas) and Mark Opler, PhD, MPH (Chief Research Officer at WCG Inc., Executive Director of the PANSS Institute, New York) (September 2024). \n    * Speech latency is an emerging objective vocal biomarker that can help validate scale-based assessments completed by human raters\n    * Brilaroxazine demonstrated a strong efficacy for negative symptoms and other key symptoms of schizophrenia such as total and positive symptoms, disorganization, and social functioning in the pivotal phase 3 RECOVER trial in schizophrenia\n    * Statistically significant results of the vocal biomarker speech latency data analysis from the RECOVER trial further support the strong efficacy of brilaroxazine for negative symptoms and other key symptom domains of schizophrenia\n\n\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * Positive speech latency data for brilaroxazine in schizophrenia from the Phase 3 RECOVER trial presented as a poster presentation at the Central Nervous System (CNS) Summit 2024 on Tuesday, November 12th in Boston, Massachusetts\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones and Events**\n\n  * Topline data from 1-year OLE trial expected in December 2024\n  * Full data analysis of the OLE trial including long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy, as well as vocal and blood biomarker data expected in Q1 2025\n  * Initiation of registrational Phase 3 RECOVER-2 trial evaluating brilaroxazine for the treatment of schizophrenia expected in Q1 2025, subject to receipt of additional financing\n  * Potential NDA submission for brilaroxazine in schizophrenia targeted for Q2 2026\n  * Investigational new drug application (IND) submission for liposomal-gel formulation of brilaroxazine in psoriasis expected in 2025\n  * Pursue partnership opportunities for the development of our pipeline\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, or $0.25 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of approximately $11.3 million, or $0.48 per share, for the same period in 2023 (as restated).\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of approximately $23.7 million, or $0.75 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of approximately $29.9 million, or $1.32 per share, for the same period in 2023 (as restated).\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash totaled approximately $5.6 million compared to approximately $23.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**About Brilaroxazine** Brilaroxazine is an in-house discovered new chemical entity with potent affinity and selectivity against key serotonin and dopamine receptors implicated in the pathobiology of several conditions including schizophrenia, psoriasis and interstitial lung diseases like pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n\nPositive topline data from the global Phase 3 RECOVER-1 trial in schizophrenia demonstrated the trial successfully met all primary and secondary endpoints with statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions across all major symptom domains including reduction in key proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathobiology of schizophrenia and comorbid inflammatory conditions at week 4 with 50 mg of brilaroxazine vs. placebo with a generally well-tolerated side effect profile comparable to placebo and discontinuation rates lower than placebo. Positive data from a clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study investigating the potential effect of CYP3A4 enzyme on brilaroxazine in healthy subjects supports no clinically significant interaction when combined with a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Reviva believes that a full battery of regulatory compliant toxicology and safety pharmacology studies has been completed for brilaroxazine. Reviva intends to develop brilaroxazine for other neuropsychiatric indications including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nAdditionally, brilaroxazine has shown promising nonclinical activity for inflammatory diseases psoriasis, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with mitigation of fibrosis and inflammation in translational animal models. Brilaroxazine has already received Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of PAH and IPF conditions.\n\nTo learn more about the clinical and preclinical data available for brilaroxazine, please visit [revivapharma.com/publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sQHo8F-ebp_5dPYX6Q903zP54P-MJJlS71-wk_ZLju1w3TWslPCFrc4QjyOgb9fzJs5FdM3nh_BNgGu7t11X5kXqvm-HLdl_TGPa8PdKQ8xKb4FOjpUP4PZYkPr40dvXL5JvgmM0chElyDk40__kMBX0cy7sfWvRkwee37f6u4Wl_3gWLhiA_7BUOru_yXO1YbENkkhryi0c0oeJIuiT7KotXCsyAKpgRDWC_f6d-QDfUpgAZ1vMOTtFieZVQSTnEv-cOhBeIfWLNWxZq2bgwitFKHaL6YdjHfi1CyuJ8clgb_OXci-ZbMZoNP4PjElm)**.**\n\n**About Reviva** Reviva is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and seeks to commercialize next-generation therapeutics for diseases representing unmet medical needs and burdens to society, patients, and their families.

had robust efficacy for total PANSS score,\npositive symptoms, and two measures of function (CGI-S, PSP)\n• In the vocal biomarker positive group, which had moderate to severe negative symptoms,\nbrilaroxazine had robust efficacy for negative symptoms\n• Turn latency measures and human raters’ scale scores cross-validate each other\n• Turn latency provides further support for the
