(NASDAQ:CLMB) (“Climb”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”), a value-added global IT channel company providing unique sales and distribution solutions for innovative technology vendors, is reporting results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales increased 52% to $119.3 million.\n  * Adjusted gross billings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 65% to $465.2 million.\n  * Net income increased more than 2x to $5.5 million or $1.19 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) also increased more than 2x to $7.1 million or $1.55 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 96% to $9.9 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Q3 was another period of exceptional growth for Climb as we generated record levels across all key financial metrics, while delivering on our acquisition objectives,” said CEO Dale Foster. “Our strong performance was driven by the execution of our core initiatives and the integration of DSS and DataSolutions into our operating platform. We also generated double-digit organic growth in both the U.S. and Europe as we deepened relationships with existing customers while signing new, innovative vendors to our line card.\n\n“Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our global infrastructure to foster organic growth while actively evaluating M&A targets that complement our geographic footprint, expand our service and solution offerings and, most importantly, align with our high-performance culture. We expect to unlock additional synergies from our acquisitions and further improve operating leverage as we execute across our global platform. We believe that these initiatives, coupled with our proven track record of accretive M&A, will enable us to close out 2024 on a strong note and achieve another year of record results.”\n\n**Dividend**\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, on October 28, 2024, Climb’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable on November 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 11, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 52% to $119.3 million compared to $78.5 million for the same period in 2023. This reflects organic growth from new and existing vendors, as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisitions of Douglas Stewart Software & Services, LLC (“DSS”) on July 31, 2024 and DataSolutions Holdings Limited (“DataSolutions”) on October 6, 2023. In addition, adjusted gross billings (“AGB”) in the third quarter of 2024 increased 65% to $465.2 million compared to $281.9 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 increased 70% to $24.3 million compared to $14.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by organic growth from new and existing vendors in both North America and Europe, as well as contributions from DSS and DataSolutions.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $13.9 million compared to $10.1 million in the year-ago period. SG&A from DSS and DataSolutions drove the majority of the increase as well as variable sales compensation attributed to the growth in AGB. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted gross billings decreased to 3.0% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 increased more than 2x to $5.5 million or $1.19 per diluted share, compared to $2.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Net income was impacted by a $1.2 million charge related to a change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration associated with DataSolutions. Adjusted net income also increased more than 2x to $7.1 million or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million or $0.56 per diluted share for the year-ago period. The Company’s earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by $0.05 in FX compared to the year-ago period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 increased 96% to $9.9 million compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth from both new and existing vendors, as well as contribution from the Company’s acquisitions of DSS and DataSolutions. Effective margin, which is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit, increased 500 basis points to 41% compared to 36% for the same period in 2023.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $22.1 million compared to $36.3 million on December 31, 2023, while working capital decreased by $12.3 million during this period. The decrease in cash was primarily attributed to the cash paid at closing for the acquisition of DSS, $20.9 million, as well as the timing of receivable collections and payables. Climb had $0.9 million of outstanding debt on September 30, 2024, with no borrowings outstanding under its $50 million revolving credit facility.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see the section titled, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call tomorrow, October 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nClimb management will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Thursday, October 31, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. Eastern timeToll-free dial-in number: (800) 274-8461International dial-in number: (203) 518-9814Conference ID: CLIMBWebcast: [Climb’s Q3 2024 Conference Call](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CUnviBplXU2j2thI6BokgnleCA-eucpIWuTrdH8j2l94etvnQLZng78ETg7sljM4ctXrK3G3T9pe3NsOtJKBM3sLsMYcz9izWihLLnfP3tvILFBwKE29GhFOLHj3A2F8Wd5qTKnO4N_OZvgiWBKDsYTuYdxFesZM-cUSaCyEqis= \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nIf you have any difficulty registering or connecting with the conference call, please contact Elevate IR at (720) 330-2829.\n\nThe conference call will also be available for replay on the investor relations section of the Company’s website at [www.climbglobalsolutions.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=I6cpjb9GJP8hHPjSQ9SfoND5n-sxEBpewne6XITyuMPXJ55YJC32AXt2CFVJ6Cy6ouuGYEpHsKViJrRthy9VEbV6H3UsQR8UGDXrfSwksn9_UfPREs6dz79AQXaQrF9U \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Climb Global Solutions**\n\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CLMB) (“Climb”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”), a value-added global IT channel company providing unique sales and distribution solutions for innovative technology vendors, is reporting results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company is also announcing the acquisition of Douglas Stewart Software & Services, LLC (“DSS”), a leading specialist distributor of software to the education market in North America.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales increased 13% to $92.1 million.\n  * Adjusted gross billings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 31% to $359.8 million.\n  * Net income increased more than 2x to $3.4 million or $0.75 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 19% to $3.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 48% to $6.9 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Our Q2 results were highlighted by another period of solid growth and improved profitability as we generated a double-digit increase in net sales and material increases in adjusted gross billings, net income and adjusted EBITDA,” said CEO Dale Foster. “This was driven by the continued execution of our core strategy – generating organic growth by deepening relationships with existing vendors, signing new cutting-edge technologies to our line card, and delivering on our acquisition objectives.\n\n“Today, we are also announcing the acquisition of Wisconsin-based IT distributor DSS, adding scale and expertise to our N.A. operations along with 20 new vendor partners including Adobe, Go Guardian and Incident IQ. DSS has delivered consistent growth through a subscription-based software licensing model, built on an 85%+ retention rate for its strategic vendor partners’ offerings. DSS is a proven leader in the EdTech channel and provides services to more than 500 value-added resellers and 250 campus stores across N.A. in both the K-12 and higher education markets. We are pleased to welcome Chuck Hulan and his team to the Climb family and look forward to unlocking synergies and cross-selling opportunities while advancing shared cloud marketplace initiatives as we integrate DSS into our platform in the months ahead.\n\n“As we enter the back half of the year, we have a solid foundation in place to continue driving strong organic growth while further improving operating leverage through the recent implementation of our new ERP. As we move into 2025, we anticipate the increased amortization expense associated with the ERP will be offset through planned operating synergies in our global platform. We will also continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that can enhance our service and solutions, in addition to our geographic footprint. These initiatives along with our robust balance sheet will enable us to deliver on both our organic and inorganic growth objectives in 2024 and beyond.”\n\n**Dividend**\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, on August 6, 2024, Climb’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable on August 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on August 16, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the second quarter of 2024 increased 13% to $92.1 million compared to $81.7 million for the same period in 2023. This reflects organic growth from new and existing vendors, as well as contribution from the Company’s acquisition of DataSolutions Holdings Limited (“DataSolutions”) in October 2023. In addition, adjusted gross billings in the second quarter of 2024 increased 31% to $359.8 million compared to $274.7 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGross profit in the second quarter of 2024 increased 36% to $18.6 million compared to $13.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by organic growth from new and existing vendors in both North America and Europe, as well as contribution from DataSolutions.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the second quarter of 2024 were $13.0 million compared to $11.6 million in the year-ago period. DataSolutions represented the majority of the increase at $1.3 million. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted gross billings decreased to 3.6% for the second quarter of 2024 compared to 4.2% in the year-ago period.\n\nNet income in the second quarter of 2024 increased more than 2x to $3.4 million or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $1.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net income increased 19% to $3.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million or $0.72 per diluted share for the year-ago period. The Company’s earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by $0.03 in FX compared to the prior year quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 increased 48% to $6.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth from both new and existing vendors, as well as contribution from the Company’s acquisition of DataSolutions. Effective margin, which is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit, increased 310 basis points to 37.3% compared to 34.2% for the same period in 2023.\n\nOn June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $48.4 million compared to $36.3 million on December 31, 2023, while working capital increased by $2.8 million during this period. The increase in cash was primarily attributed to DataSolutions cash balance and the timing of receivable collections and payables. Climb had $1.0 million of outstanding debt on June 30, 2024, with no borrowings outstanding under its $50 million revolving credit facility.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see the section titled, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\n\n**Acquisition of Douglas Stewart Software & Services, LLC **\n\nClimb closed on the acquisition of DSS on July 31, 2024, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.3 million payable at closing (subject to working capital and other adjustments), plus a potential post-closing earn-out. Climb funded the acquisition of DSS utilizing cash from the Company’s balance sheet.\n\nDSS is a Wisconsin-based, specialist IT distributor focused on SaaS solutions for education customers serving resellers in the North America reseller market and was a separate division of the privately-held Douglas Stewart Company. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2024, DSS reported adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5.3 million, which was up 10% over the same period in the prior year.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call tomorrow, August 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nClimb management will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Wednesday, August 7, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. Eastern timeToll-free dial-in number: (800) 245-3047International dial-in number: (203) 518-9765Conference ID: CLIMBWebcast: [Climb’s Q2 2024 Conference Call](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fVXmmRMniZ8bH2x7MbicraKCmfF3rmqU1DkiRUnDSiEwjRPUWFm2pAZ9SqYKe2z7y4OoqeXxZySY-20KFtBAMwe39QFqr3Yz7NeS-xBDMEuz5tTVdl8OoJIZ7OsIxTZgXepyx-7jzS5LtYEVt4pSkavDXtJdsacTN5878r61wYQ= \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nIf you have any difficulty registering or connecting with the conference call, please contact Elevate IR at (720) 330-2829.\n\nThe conference call will also be available for replay on the investor relations section of the Company’s website at [www.climbglobalsolutions.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5XoRAk13kU6V6KBxeXetCuqADvE3_N7L8kfdBovPji4eVE-bIW0xJ9ZiOkuDf9Xf25CyedNVxAqHZbmSRbGDo1FcxF8E0W3RfuKpSeZfQeCUih8zxJAKAAn7ZNP-HN5R \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Climb Global Solutions**\n\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc.

(NASDAQ:CLMB) (“Climb”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”), a value-added global IT channel company providing unique sales and distribution solutions for innovative technology vendors, is reporting results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Summary vs. Same Year-Ago Quarter**\n\n  * Net sales increased 52% to $119.3 million.\n  * Adjusted gross billings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 65% to $465.2 million.\n  * Net income increased more than 2x to $5.5 million or $1.19 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted net income (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) also increased more than 2x to $7.1 million or $1.55 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) increased 96% to $9.9 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Q3 was another period of exceptional growth for Climb as we generated record levels across all key financial metrics, while delivering on our acquisition objectives,” said CEO Dale Foster. “Our strong performance was driven by the execution of our core initiatives and the integration of DSS and DataSolutions into our operating platform. We also generated double-digit organic growth in both the U.S. and Europe as we deepened relationships with existing customers while signing new, innovative vendors to our line card.\n\n“Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our global infrastructure to foster organic growth while actively evaluating M&A targets that complement our geographic footprint, expand our service and solution offerings and, most importantly, align with our high-performance culture. We expect to unlock additional synergies from our acquisitions and further improve operating leverage as we execute across our global platform. We believe that these initiatives, coupled with our proven track record of accretive M&A, will enable us to close out 2024 on a strong note and achieve another year of record results.”\n\n**Dividend**\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, on October 28, 2024, Climb’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of its common stock payable on November 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on November 11, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nNet sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 52% to $119.3 million compared to $78.5 million for the same period in 2023. This reflects organic growth from new and existing vendors, as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisitions of Douglas Stewart Software & Services, LLC (“DSS”) on July 31, 2024 and DataSolutions Holdings Limited (“DataSolutions”) on October 6, 2023. In addition, adjusted gross billings (“AGB”) in the third quarter of 2024 increased 65% to $465.2 million compared to $281.9 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGross profit in the third quarter of 2024 increased 70% to $24.3 million compared to $14.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by organic growth from new and existing vendors in both North America and Europe, as well as contributions from DSS and DataSolutions.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $13.9 million compared to $10.1 million in the year-ago period. SG&A from DSS and DataSolutions drove the majority of the increase as well as variable sales compensation attributed to the growth in AGB. SG&A as a percentage of adjusted gross billings decreased to 3.0% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 3.6% in the year-ago period.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 increased more than 2x to $5.5 million or $1.19 per diluted share, compared to $2.4 million or $0.52 per diluted share for the same period in 2023. Net income was impacted by a $1.2 million charge related to a change in fair value of acquisition contingent consideration associated with DataSolutions. Adjusted net income also increased more than 2x to $7.1 million or $1.55 per diluted share, compared to $2.6 million or $0.56 per diluted share for the year-ago period. The Company’s earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2024 was negatively impacted by $0.05 in FX compared to the year-ago period.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 increased 96% to $9.9 million compared to $5.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth from both new and existing vendors, as well as contribution from the Company’s acquisitions of DSS and DataSolutions. Effective margin, which is defined as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit, increased 500 basis points to 41% compared to 36% for the same period in 2023.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $22.1 million compared to $36.3 million on December 31, 2023, while working capital decreased by $12.3 million during this period. The decrease in cash was primarily attributed to the cash paid at closing for the acquisition of DSS, $20.9 million, as well as the timing of receivable collections and payables. Climb had $0.9 million of outstanding debt on September 30, 2024, with no borrowings outstanding under its $50 million revolving credit facility.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see the section titled, “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call tomorrow, October 31, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time to discuss its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nClimb management will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDate: Thursday, October 31, 2024Time: 8:30 a.m. Eastern timeToll-free dial-in number: (800) 274-8461International dial-in number: (203) 518-9814Conference ID: CLIMBWebcast: [Climb’s Q3 2024 Conference Call](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CUnviBplXU2j2thI6BokgnleCA-eucpIWuTrdH8j2l94etvnQLZng78ETg7sljM4ctXrK3G3T9pe3NsOtJKBM3sLsMYcz9izWihLLnfP3tvILFBwKE29GhFOLHj3A2F8Wd5qTKnO4N_OZvgiWBKDsYTuYdxFesZM-cUSaCyEqis= \"Opens in a new window\")\n\nIf you have any difficulty registering or connecting with the conference call, please contact Elevate IR at (720) 330-2829.\n\nThe conference call will also be available for replay on the investor relations section of the Company’s website at [www.climbglobalsolutions.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=I6cpjb9GJP8hHPjSQ9SfoND5n-sxEBpewne6XITyuMPXJ55YJC32AXt2CFVJ6Cy6ouuGYEpHsKViJrRthy9VEbV6H3UsQR8UGDXrfSwksn9_UfPREs6dz79AQXaQrF9U \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**About Climb Global Solutions**\n\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc.

The statements, other than statements of historical fact,\nincluded in this Annual Report are forward-looking statements. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report\nmay be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates,”\n“projects,” “forecasts,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “confident,” “may,” “can,” “potential,” “possible,” “proposed,” “in\nprocess,” “under construction,” “in development,” “opportunity,” “target,” “outlook,” “maintain,” “continue,” “goal,” “aim,”\n“commit,” or similar expressions or when we discuss our future operating results, priorities, strategy, goals, vision, mission, opportunities,\nprojections, intentions or expectations. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements\nare reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Because these forward-looking statements\nare subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These\nrisks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the continued acceptance of the Company’s distribution channel by vendors and\ncustomers, the timely availability and acceptance of new products, product mix, market conditions, inflation, competitive pricing pressures,\nthe successful integration of acquisitions, contribution of key vendor relationships and support programs, including vendor rebates and\ndiscounts, interest rate risk and impact thereof, as well as factors that affect the software industry in general and other factors generally.\nWe strongly urge current and prospective investors to carefully consider the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in this report,\nparticularly the risks described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” herein.\nThe Company operates in a rapidly changing business, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot\npredict every risk factor, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of all such risk factors on the Company’s business or the extent to which any\nfactor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results and readers are cautioned not\nto place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. The Company undertakes no obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe statements concerning future sales, future gross profit margin and future selling and administrative expenses are forward\nlooking statements involving certain risks and uncertainties such as availability of products, product mix, pricing pressures, market\nconditions and other factors, which could result in a fluctuation of sales below recent experience.\nUnless otherwise specified, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Climb Global Solutions, Inc., a Delaware corporation,\nand its consolidated subsidiaries.\nTable of Contents\nItem 1. Business\nGeneral\nThe Company is a value added information technology (“IT”) distribution and solutions company. The Company primarily\noperates through its “Distribution” segment, which distributes emerging technologies to corporate resellers, value added resellers\n(“VARs”), consultants and systems integrators worldwide under the name “Climb Channel Solutions”. The Company also operates a\nsmaller segment called “Solutions”, which is a cloud solutions provider and value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for\ncustomers worldwide under the name “Grey Matter”. Across both segments, we offer an extensive line of products from leading software\nvendors and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle\nmanagement and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1982. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) is listed\non The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “CLMB”.\nDistribution Segment\nIn our Distribution segment, which accounted for approximately 92% of our consolidated net sales and 83% of our consolidated\ngross profit during the year ended December 31, 2023, we distribute technology products from software developers, software vendors or\noriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to resellers, and system integrators worldwide. We purchase software, maintenance/service\nagreements, networking/storage/security equipment and complementary products from our vendors and sell them to our reseller customers.\nThe large majority of products we sell are “drop shipped” directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company and\nrequired investment in inventory. Generally, a vendor authorizes a limited number of companies to act as distributors of their product and\nsell their product to resellers. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers,\nsystem integrators, direct marketers, and national IT superstores. We combine our core strengths in customer service, marketing,\ndistribution, credit and billing to allow our customers to achieve greater efficiencies in time to market in the IT channel in a cost-effective\nmanner.\nWhile our Distribution business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of adjusted gross billings, or gross margin,\nand price competition, we have been able to operate profitably by leveraging an efficient and scalable business model with low capital\ninvestment requirements. The large majority of the products we sell are either digital products such as license authorizations, third party\nmaintenance contracts, or hardware that is dropped shipped to the end customer directly by the vendor. We utilize electronic digital\ninterchange (“EDI”) and other automation to fulfill these orders on a cost-efficient basis. We also maintain relatively low inventory\nbalances relative to our gross billings and enjoy what we believe is favorable credit from our vendor partners, allowing us to deploy a\ncapital efficient model as reflected by our return on equity and pre-tax income as a percentage of gross profit generated.\nIn our Distribution segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for the products we sell, and on our partners’\nstrategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new\nproducts, replacement and renewal cycles for existing products, competitive products, overall economic growth and general business\nactivity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the industry and increased price-\nbased competition. We continually review the marketplace to identify new and emerging vendors and products to potentially add to our\nvendor partners.\nThe Company operates a distribution facility in Eatontown, New Jersey and Dublin, Ireland.\nSolutions Segment\nWe also provide comprehensive IT solutions directly to end users through our Solutions segment, which accounted for\napproximately 8% of our consolidated net sales and 17% of our consolidated gross profit during the year\n1\nTable of Contents\nended December 31, 2023. Products in this segment are acquired directly from OEMS, software developers or distributors and sold to end\nusers. We provide customer service, billing, sales and marketing support in this segment and provide extended payment terms to facilitate\nsales.\nAcquisitions\nWe view acquisitions as an important part of our strategic growth plan. In 2020, we completed two acquisitions to add scale,\nbroaden our geographic footprint, expand partner relationships and add cloud support capabilities. In 2022, we completed an acquisition\nthat expanded our sales presence in the United Kingdom distribution operations.\nIn 2023, we completed the acquisition of Data Solutions Holdings Limited (“Data Solutions”), which further expanded our\ngeographic footprint and partner relationships in the United Kingdom and Ireland distribution operations.\nWe plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as part of our overall capital allocation strategy and continuing growth\nplan.\nProducts\nAn essential part of our ongoing operations and strategic growth plan in our Distribution segment is the continued recruitment of\nsoftware vendors for which we become authorized distributors of their products. Through our Distribution segment, we sell a wide variety\nof technology products from a broad range of software vendors and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Flexera Software, Intel\nSoftware, Microsoft, Micro Focus, Mindjet, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Trend Micro,\nUnitrends, Tintri and Extrahop. On a continuous basis, we screen new vendors and products for inclusion in our line card based on their\nfeatures, quality, price, profit margins and current market trends. Developing a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business\nstrategy. We focus on establishing deep relationships with our vendor and reseller partners by providing specialized product training to our\nsales force and the use of dedicated sales teams. We have also established an efficient ordering process with our key partners through the\nimplementation of electronic ordering and other processes adapted to their requirements. As a result, our relationships with our key vendor\npartners tend to be long-term in nature despite the absence of long-term contracts, with a significant portion of sales derived from annually\nrecurring renewals of software maintenance and subscription agreements related to our partners embedded base of customers utilizing their\nsoftware products. Additionally, a key part of our strategic growth plan is to provide a high level of support to select emerging technology\nvendors through our Climb Elevate program to develop future relationships throughout the growth cycle of a vendor partner.\nIn our Solutions business, an essential part of our strategic growth plan is to pursue opportunities with higher growth prospects\nand gross margin characteristics through the sale of specialty products, services and cloud offerings. Through acquisitions in the prior\nyears, we added certain technical and administrative support capabilities to enable us to resell cloud and software as a service products\n(“SaaS”) including Microsoft products in the United Kingdom. Our strategic growth plan is to expand our cloud offerings by leveraging\nthese support services to other markets and products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we had one vendor that accounted for 14% of our consolidated purchases and our largest\nfive vendors generated approximately 40% of our consolidated purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this same vendor\naccounted for 17% of our consolidated purchases. The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and\notherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company predominantly sells third party software, software subscriptions, and maintenance. Sales of hardware and\nperipherals represented 6% of our adjusted gross billings in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCloud\nOur vendor and reseller partners are increasingly incorporating cloud and hybrid cloud products into their portfolios. An essential\npart of our strategic growth plan is to provide value added services to our vendor partners and customers to enhance their ability to market\nthese products. This includes maintaining infrastructure to facilitate licensing of cloud and SaaS products, providing technical support for\ncloud products, and providing integration and enablement\n2\nTable of Contents\nservices. We currently have the ability to provide support for these cloud services in North America, United Kingdom and Europe, and plan\nto continue to leverage these capabilities to provide cloud support services throughout our worldwide operations.\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, events,\nwebinars, and social media. We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to\ncurrent customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers. We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional\nmarketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software vendors and manufacturers. These programs provide a cost-\neffective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.\nWe sell products to large, multi-national broad line resellers, sometimes referred to as direct market resellers (“DMRs”), as well as\nthousands of VARs, which tend to be smaller and focus on value added services to their customers. As part of our strategic growth plan, we\nexpect to continue diversifying our customer base by offering compelling products to the VAR community as we develop our vendor\npartner lineup. As a result, an increasing proportion of our sales in 2023 were from VARs, driven by a continued focus on increasing sales\nto larger VARs with more than $1 million in annual sales. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had two customers, both of\nwhom are considered DMRs, that accounted for 20%, and 15%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2023, 15%\nand 6%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2022, these same two customers accounted for\n21%, and 16%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2022, 16% and 18%, respectively, of total net accounts\nreceivable. Our top five customers accounted for 51% and 52% of consolidated net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The loss of a key\ncustomer or a group of customers could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nNet sales in Europe and the UK represented 19% and 14% of our consolidated net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net sales\nto customers in Canada represented 7% and 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2023 and 2022, respectively. For geographic financial\ninformation, please refer to Note 13 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCustomer Support\nWe believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales\nand revenue growth. Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, returns\nprocessing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability. The account representatives are trained to answer all basic\nquestions about the features and functionality of products.\nPurchasing and Fulfillment\nThe Company’s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its vendor partners to develop and market products that meet the\nchanging requirements of the marketplace. The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its vendors. The Company and its\nprincipal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs. As is customary in the industry, the\nCompany has no long-term supply contracts with any of its vendor partners, and substantially all the Company’s contracts with its vendors\nare terminable upon 30 days’ notice or less, however, it is notable that the tenure of our relationships with vendor partners tends to extend\nover a longer term. We attribute this to the deep relationships we establish with our partners involving sales support, product and customer\nknowledge, and tailored infrastructure to facilitate efficient order processing.\nMost vendor partners or distributors will “drop ship” products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the\nCompany. Inventory management techniques, such as “drop shipping” allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without\nincreased inventory requirements or cost of carrying inventory.\nInventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company’s practice of\nmaking advance purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the\n3\nTable of Contents\naddition of new vendor partners and products. From time to time, we may make advance payments to vendors to apply against future\npurchases from the vendor. Moreover, the Company’s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain\nproducts in time for next day shipping. The Company promotes the use of EDI with its vendor partners and customers, which helps reduce\noverhead and the use of paper in the ordering process.\nCompetition\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. There is significant\ncompetition within each market segment and geography served that creates pricing pressure and the need to continually improve services.\nThe market for the technology products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and competitive pricing.\nThe way software products are distributed and sold is constantly changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or\nexpand, including direct sales by technology providers to end users, and the introduction of cloud versions of their products. As an IT\nchannel solutions provider, a critical element of our strategic growth plan is to maintain our ability to offer an efficient route to market for\nemerging technology vendors. Additionally, a key element of our strategic growth plan is to capitalize on market changes by implementing\nnew value added services such as cloud support and integration offerings.\nIn our Distribution segment, we compete with other distributors to become an authorized distributor of products from software\ndevelopers and vendors. The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily based on its reputation for\nsuccessfully bringing new products to market and the strength of and quality of its relationships with software vendors and the reseller\ncommunity. We also compete against other distributors to gain market share among authorized resellers for products we are authorized to\ndistribute, based on price and level of service. We compete against much larger broad-line distributors with more resources than we have,\nincluding Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE: ARW), TD Synnex Corporation (NYSE: SNX) and Ingram Micro, as well as specialty\ndistributors. We believe we offer a compelling solution for emerging technology vendors seeking to establish the IT channel as a route to\nmarket, by offering broad distribution capabilities with more flexibility than some of our larger competitors.\nIn our Solutions segment, we compete against a large variety of IT solutions providers including e-commerce sites, service\norganizations, value added resellers, cloud solution providers and technology providers offering direct solutions. We believe that our ability\nto offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of desired IT products at reasonable prices with prompt\ndelivery and high customer service levels, along with our good relationships with vendor partners, allows us to compete effectively.\nInformation Technology\nThe Company operates IT systems on several platforms including Windows and cloud-based platforms that control the full order\nprocessing cycle. These IT systems allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable,\npurchasing, sales and distribution and payment processing. We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our technology\nsystems, telephone systems, websites, e-mail and EDI systems.\nOur IT systems allow us to monitor sales trends, real-time product availability, order status throughout the full order cycle, and\nautomates order transactions and invoicing transactions for our customers and vendors. The main focus of our IT systems is to allow us to\ntransact and communicate with our customers and vendors in the most efficient manner possible. We provide various options to transact\nelectronically with our customers and vendors through EDI, XML and other electronic methods.\nThe Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its IT systems to effectively manage and secure its infrastructure and\ncustomer data and to provide continued scalability and flexibility. In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time,\nrequire software and hardware upgrades for its present IT systems.\nTrademarks, Service Marks and Domain Names\nThe Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Climb Channel Solutions, Grey Matter,\nClimb Global Services and International Software Partners. The Company protects these\n4\nTable of Contents\ntrademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.\nWe have registered and maintained Internet domain names, including “climbglobalsolutions.com”.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Company is subject to and endeavors to comply with various government regulations in the United States as well as various\njurisdictions where it operates. These regulations cover several diverse areas including trade compliance, anti-bribery, anti-corruption,\nmoney laundering, securities, environmental, and data and privacy protection. Increased government scrutiny of the Company's actions or\nenforcement could materially and adversely affect its business or damage its reputation. In addition, the Company may conduct, or it may\nbe required to conduct, internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government or regulatory\nagencies, which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert management and key personnel from the Company’s business\noperations. See Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.\nEmployees and Human Capital\nWe understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building our culture, talent development, compensation and\nbenefits, and diversity and inclusion. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and\nintegrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The attraction, retention and development of employees is critical to\nour success. We accomplish this, in part, by our competitive compensation practices, training initiatives, and growth opportunities within\nthe Company.\nThe Company believes its capabilities and services are made possible by a broad group of professionals who understand its\ncustomer's problems from numerous perspectives and curate forward-looking, comprehensive solutions. The Company's employees’\ndiverse backgrounds have melded into rich perspectives that sharpen the Company, drive more scale, extending the Company's value,\nwinning in the market with the diversity of its people and the strength of its culture, to enhance value for customers and benefit all\nstakeholders.\nThe Company's business results depend in part on its ability to successfully manage human capital resources, including attracting,\nidentifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified employees include\nemployee morale, its reputation, competition from other employers, and availability of qualified individuals.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 365 total employees, including 342 full-time employees. The Company is not a party\nto any collective bargaining agreements with its employees, has experienced no work stoppages and considers its relationships with its\nemployees to be satisfactory.\nThe following table shows the Company’s approximate headcount by region:\nAmericas EMEA\nHeadcount 181 184\nWorkforce Health and Safety\nWe take workplace safety very seriously and our robust safety program means that we are constantly evaluating our safety\nprotocols in an effort to keep our facilities safe for our employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit\nprograms for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to\n5\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive base wages, additional programs include the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan, a company matched 401(k) Plan, healthcare and\ninsurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, paid time off and employee assistance programs.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to our continued efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports the\nworkforce and the communities we serve. We recruit the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits\nand it is our policy to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace.\nCompany Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 4 Industrial Way West, Suite 300 Eatontown, NJ 07724, and our telephone number is\n(732) 389-0932.

Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual\nReport. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and could\ncause our results to differ from the “forward-looking statements” contained in this Annual Report. Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe serve customers and have locations throughout the world and are subject to terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters,\nglobal pandemic and other similar risks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, global pandemics or other disasters or public health concerns in regions of the\nworld where we have operations could result in the disruption of our business. Such acts, including Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine\nand the Israel-Hamas war, have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global\neconomic instability. Specifically, these acts, pandemics, disasters and health concerns can result in increased travel restrictions and\nextended shutdowns of certain businesses in the region, as well as social, economic, or labor instability. Disruptions in affected regions\nover a prolonged period could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial results.\nChanges in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and\nservices we sell. Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general\neconomic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of\nnew products, upgrades or methods of distribution. The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in\ntechnology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Net sales can be dependent on\ndemand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on\nour net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.\nWe rely on our vendor partners for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to\nsell. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors. The loss of a vendor partner could\ncause a disruption in the availability of products. Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell\ndirectly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to\ndistributors/resellers like us. For example, resellers and software vendors may attempt to increase the volume of software products\ndistributed electronically through Electronic Software Distribution (“ESD”) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line\nshopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us. Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of\nproducts, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels,\nrelative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients’ orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition. We also rely on our vendor partners to provide funds for us to market their\nproducts, including through our on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us. If any of the vendor partners that\nhave historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results\nof operations.\nThe IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products\nwe sell, can negatively affect our business. Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit\navailability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs.\nWe compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and\nresellers of IT products and services. In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute\nelectronically directly to end-users and in the future, will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements\nsold by us. Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue. There can be no assurance\nthat we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of\nprice reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of\n7\nTable of Contents\nservices, which service sales typically are delivered at higher gross margins, or otherwise. Price reductions by our competitors that we\neither cannot or choose not to match, could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match, such\nreductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe way software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or\nexpand. Software vendors have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. There can be no assurances\nthat software developers and vendors will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do. Future efforts by\nsoftware developers and vendors to bypass third-party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition. In addition, resellers and software vendors may attempt to increase the volume of software products\ndistributed electronically through ESD technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services. Any of these\ncompetitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition. The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company’s\nauthorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.\nWe offer credit to our customers and, therefore, are subject to significant credit risk. We sell our products to a large and diverse\ncustomer base. We finance a significant portion of such sales through trade credit, typically by providing 30 to 60-day payment terms. In\naddition, we offer extended payment terms to certain customers for terms of up to two years. As a result, our business could be adversely\naffected in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of our customers, resulting in the customers’ inability to repay us. This risk\nmay increase if there is a general economic downturn affecting a large number of our customers and in the event our customers do not\nadequately manage their business or properly disclose their financial condition. Also, certain of our larger customers require greater than\n30-day payment terms which could increase our credit risk and decrease our operating cash flow.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies. We compete in all areas of our business against local, regional, national,\nand international firms. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities\nthan we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices\nin order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we face\ncompetition from vendors, which may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through channel partners such as\nthe Company, and this could adversely affect our future sales. Many competitors compete based principally on price and may have lower\ncosts or accept lower selling prices than we do and, therefore, our gross margins may not be maintainable. Our gross margins have declined\nhistorically and may continue to decline in the future. Our competitors may offer better or different products and services than we offer. In\naddition, we do not have guaranteed purchasing volume commitments from our customers and, therefore, our sales volume may be volatile.\nOur business is substantially dependent on a limited number of customers and vendors, and the loss or any change in the\nbusiness habits of such key customers or vendors may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause our standing arrangements and agreements with our customers and vendors typically contain no purchase or sale obligations and\nare terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice, we are subject to significant risks associated with\nthe loss or change at any time in the business habits and financial condition of key customers or vendors. We have experienced the loss and\nchanges in the business habits of key customer and vendor relationships in the past and expect to do so again in the future.\nSales of products purchased from our largest two vendors accounted for 23% of our 2023 purchases and sales from our largest five\nvendors generated approximately 40% of 2023 purchases. As is the case with many of our vendor and customer relationships, our\ncontractual arrangements with these large vendors are terminable by either party upon several months’ notice. If these contracts or our\nrelationships with these vendors terminate for any reason, or if any of our other significant vendor relationships terminate for any reason,\nand we are not able to sell or procure a sufficient supply of those products from alternative sources, or at all, our financial position and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected. Our vendors are subject to many if not all of the same (or similar) risks and uncertainties\nto which we are subject,\n8\nTable of Contents\nas well as other risks and uncertainties, and we compete with others for their business. Accordingly, we are at a continual risk of loss of\ntheir business on account of a number of factors and forces, many of which are largely beyond our control.\nIn 2023, our two largest customers accounted for 35% of our net sales and our largest five customers accounted for 51% of our net\nsales. If any of our significant customer relationships terminate for any reason, and we are not able to replace those customers and\nassociated revenues, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause\nus to incur additional expenses. We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in\nlarge part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients. Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the\naccuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service,\ndistribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.\nFailure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. Privacy,\nsecurity, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border\ncommerce increases. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal\ninformation of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under several regulatory regimes.\nIn the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain\naspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data\nover public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Although we did not have any material cybersecurity breaches in 2023, any\nfailure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our\nnetwork security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our\nreputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs,\nand also result in deterioration in our employees’, partners’ and clients’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus\ncould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain key personnel. Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel\nfor strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers. We also believe that our future success\nwill be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical\npersonnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. Further, we make a significant investment in the\ntraining of our sales account executives. Our inability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding\nneeds or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our\nsales staff, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may explore additional growth through acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we completed one\nacquisition to expand our sales presence in Ireland and the United Kingdom distribution operations and bring key vendor partner\nrelationships to our portfolio. As part of our strategic growth plan, we may pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or\nexpand our existing business. As a result, we regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, which may be material in size and\nscope. In addition to those risks to which our business and the acquired businesses are generally subject, the acquisition of these businesses\ngives rise to transactional and transitional risks, and the risk that the anticipated benefits will not be realized.\nWhen the Company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such\nacquisitions. As part of the Company’s history and strategic growth plan, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous\nrisks, including the following:\n● effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;\n● unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;\n9\nTable of Contents\n● not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;\n● diversion of management’s attention;\n● negative effects on existing customer and vendor partner relationships; and\n● potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\nFurther, the Company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or\ntechnologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those\ntraditionally associated with the Company’s core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities\nthat in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its vendor partners. If the Company is not successful in mitigating\nor insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency. We have several foreign subsidiaries and conduct\nbusiness in various countries and currencies. As result of these foreign operations, we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency\nrates resulting primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. While our\nconsolidated financial statements are reported in US dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the US are prepared using\nthe local currency as the functional currency and translated into US dollars. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the US dollar\nrelative to the functional currencies of our subsidiaries could cause fluctuations in our results of operations. We also have foreign currency\nexposure to the extent net sales and purchases are not denominated in a subsidiary’s functional currency, which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company’s non-U.S. sales represent an increasing portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to\nrisks associated with operating internationally. In 2023 and 2022, approximately 26% and 22% of the Company’s net sales came from its\noperations outside the United States, respectively. As a result of the Company’s international sales and locations, its operations are subject\nto a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\n● import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;\n● the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations;\n● potential restrictions on transfers of funds;\n● import and export tariffs, duties and value-added taxes;\n● transportation delays and interruptions;\n● the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;\n● uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations;\n● foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;\n● stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;\n● volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;\n● potential military conflicts and political risks; and\n● currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.\nThe terms of our debt arrangement impose restrictions on our ability to operate which in turn could negatively affect our ability\nto respond to business and market conditions and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had approximately $1.3 million outstanding under our term loan with First American Commercial Bancorp and\nthere were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The terms of one or more of the\nagreements under which this indebtedness was incurred may limit or restrict, among other things, our (or our subsidiaries', as applicable)\nability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, or enter into certain transactions.\nWe are also required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests under certain of our debt\nfacilities. Our inability to meet these ratios and tests could result in the acceleration of the repayment\n10\nTable of Contents\nof the related debt, termination of the applicable facility, an increase in our effective cost of funds or the cross-default of other debt\nfacilities and securitization arrangements. As a result, our ability to operate may be restricted and our ability to respond to business and\nmarket conditions may be limited, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to\nincrease significantly. Interest rates have increased and may continue to increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on the obligations\nunder certain of our credit facilities, or other variable rate debt incurrences or offerings could increase. If interest rates increase and we\nborrow amounts under certain of our credit facilities, debt service obligations and our interest expense will increase. Our net income and\ncash flows, including cash available for servicing indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nAn increase in interest rates may increase our future borrowing costs and restrict our access to capital. Additionally, current market\nconditions, the global economy, and overall credit conditions could limit our availability of capital, which could cause increases in interest\nmargin spreads over underlying indices, effectively increasing the cost of our borrowing.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may be liable for misuse of our customers’ or employees’ information. Third-parties, such as hackers, could circumvent or\nsabotage the security practices and products used in our product and service offerings, and/or the security practices or products used in our\ninternal IT systems, which could result in disclosure of sensitive or personal information, unauthorized procurement, or other business\ninterruptions that could damage our reputation and disrupt our business. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and\ntargeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats.\nOur employees work in a hybrid environment, which includes splitting time between working from the office and working from\nhome, we are highly reliant on the availability and functionality of our information systems to enable our operations. Working from home\nmay increase risk of data loss, including privacy-related events. If our information systems are not operational for reasons which may\ninclude cyber security attacks, data center failures, failures by telecom providers to provide services to our business and to our employees’\nhomes, power failures, or failures of off-premise software such as SaaS based software, our business and financial results may be adversely\nimpacted.\nIf third-parties or our employees are able to maliciously penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our\ncustomers’ information or employees’ personal information, or other information for which our customers may be responsible and for\nwhich we agree to be responsible in connection with service contracts into which we may enter, or if we give third-parties or our employees\nimproper access to certain information, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include claims for unauthorized access to\ndevices on our network; unauthorized access to our customers’ networks, hardware, applications, data, devices, or software; unauthorized\npurchases with credit card information; and identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims. This liability could also include claims for\nother misuses of or inappropriate access to personal information. Other liability could include claims alleging misrepresentation of our\nprivacy and data security practices. Any such liability for misappropriation of this information could decrease our profitability. In addition,\nfederal and state agencies have been investigating various companies regarding whether they misused or inadequately secured information.\nWe could incur additional expenses when new laws or regulations regarding the use, safeguarding, or privacy of information are enacted, or\nif governmental agencies require us to substantially modify our privacy or security practices. We could fail to comply with international\nand domestic data privacy laws, the violation of which may result in audits, fines, penalties, litigation, or administrative enforcement\nactions with associated costs.\nOur operations are subject to numerous complex federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations in a number\nof areas, including labor and employment, advertising, e-commerce, tax, trade, import and export requirements, economic and trade\nsanctions, anti-corruption, data privacy requirements (including those under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation\nand the California Consumer Privacy Act), anti-competition, environmental and health and safety. The evaluation of, and compliance\nwith these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and these laws and regulations may have other\nadverse impacts on our\n11\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, these laws and regulations are evolving and may be inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business, and the risk of noncompliance.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there\ncan be no guarantee against coworkers, contractors or agents violating such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. As a\npublic company, we also are subject to increasingly complex public disclosure, corporate governance and accounting requirements that\nincrease compliance costs and require significant management focus.\nThe Company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of\ndamages or licensing fees and could limit the Company's ability to use certain technologies in the future. Certain of the Company's\nproducts and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the Company's third-party vendor partners. Substantial litigation and\nthreats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties\n(including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of\naggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to\ntechnologies that are important to the Company's business. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the Company may be able\nto seek indemnification from its vendor partners for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be\nsuccessful in obtaining such indemnification or that the Company is fully protected against such claims. Any infringement claim brought\nagainst the Company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost to the Company, divert\nmanagement's attention and resources, be time consuming to defend, result in substantial damage awards, or cause product shipment\ndelays.\nAdditionally, if an infringement claim is successful the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license\narrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may\nsignificantly increase the Company's operating expenses and impact the Company's operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty\nor license arrangements may not be available at all. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which\ncould affect the Company's ability to compete effectively.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders. Publicly traded companies have\nincreasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructurings, increased\nborrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or the activists themselves.\nResponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and\ndivert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder\nactivism or changes to the composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business,\ninstability or lack of continuity. These uncertainties may be more acute or heightened when an activist seeks to change a majority of the\nBoard of Directors or ultimately desires to acquire the Company. Additionally, actions by activist shareholders may be exploited by our\ncompetitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and may\ncreate adverse uncertainty for our employees.\nChanges in accounting rules, or the misapplication of current accounting rules, may adversely affect our future financial\nresults. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting\nprinciples are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the\nSEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate\naccounting policies. Future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in noncash charges and/or\nchanges in presentation or disclosure. In addition, any change in accounting standards may influence our customers’ decision to purchase\nfrom us or finance transactions with us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are required to determine if we are the principal or agent in all transactions with our customers. The voluminous number of\nproducts and services we sell, and the manner in which they are bundled, are technologically\n12\nTable of Contents\ncomplex. Mischaracterization of these products and services could result in misapplication of revenue recognition polices. We use estimates\nwhere necessary, such as allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns, which require judgment and are based on best available\ninformation. If we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of these services or the timeline for completion of contracts, the profitability of\nour contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nFinancial Risks and Market Risks\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate, which could lead to volatility in our stock price. Our revenue and operating results\nhave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you should not rely on quarter-to-\nquarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results\ncould negatively affect the trading price of our stock. In addition, our revenue and results of operations may, in the future, be below the\nexpectations of analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Factors that are likely to cause our revenue and\noperating results to fluctuate include the risk factors discussed throughout this section.\nOur goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce\nnet income in the year in which the write-off occurs. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the\nassets acquired. The Company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of vendor relationships,\ncustomer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The Company may incur impairment charges on goodwill\nor identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current\ncarrying values. The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion,\nof the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to\nearnings would become necessary.\nA decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, and increase in income tax rates, or the\ncompany’s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the Company’s\nreporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets, as well as the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe inability to obtain financing on favorable terms may adversely impact our business, financial position and results of\noperations. Our business requires working capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed\nby trade creditors. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, revolving credit facilities and trade credit from our\nvendors to satisfy our capital needs and finance growth. As the financial markets change, the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of\nfinancing may change. Changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital, or\ncapital may not be available to us on competitive terms to fund our working capital needs.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the future, which could impair the value of our\nCommon Stock. We have paid a quarterly dividend on our Common Stock since the first quarter of 2003. Any future declaration of\ndividends remains subject to further determination from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends in the future\nwill depend on our financial results, liquidity and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the\nfuture, or if we are able to, that our Board of Directors will continue to declare dividends in the future, at current rates or at all. If we\ndiscontinue or reduce the amount or frequency of dividends, the value of our Common Stock may be impaired.\nRisks related to our Common Stock. The issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock. Trading\nvolume in our Common Stock varies significantly based on a number of factors, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our\nCommon Stock. As a result of the potentially low volume trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more\nthan the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger float, our Common Stock will be less liquid\nthan the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more\nvolatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small\n13\nTable of Contents\nvolume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were\nlarger.\nOur Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market tier of the Nasdaq Stock Market, and we therefore are subject to\ncontinued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of\nstockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders’ equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total\nassets and total revenues. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market. If\nwe do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our Common Stock on another exchange, our\nCommon Stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the “pink sheets”. As a result, we could face significant adverse\nconsequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue\nadditional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGlobal and regional economic and political conditions may have an adverse impact on our business. Weak economic conditions\ngenerally, sustained uncertainty about global economic and political conditions, government spending cuts and the impact of new\ngovernment policies, or a tightening of credit markets, could cause our customers and potential customers to postpone or reduce spending\non technology products or services or put downward pressure on prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations or cash flows. For example, there continues to be substantial uncertainty regarding the economic impact of the UK's exit from\nthe European Union (\"EU\"), referred to as \"Brexit\". The potentially divergent laws and regulations as a result of Brexit may continue to\nlead to economic and legal uncertainty, causing increased economic volatility or disrupting the markets and clients we serve.\nGeneral economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits. Generally, economic downturns, may cause some of our\ncurrent and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new\ntechnologies and increased price competition. We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting\nin increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations. Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and\nmay not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand. In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer\nbankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors’ ability to\nsupply products, which could disrupt our operations. The realization of any or all these risks could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal\ncontrols over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have\na material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the Company to produce reliable\nfinancial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The Company is required to annually evaluate the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the Company may\nconclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent\nlimitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition,\ncontrol procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the Company fails to maintain an effective\nsystem of internal controls, or if management or the Company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material\nweaknesses in the Company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory\nauthorities, such as the SEC or the NASDAQ. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of\nconfidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its Common Stock to decline or\nlimit the Company's access to capital.\nChanges in income tax and other regulatory legislation. We operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and\nmake plans for our structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the\n14\nTable of Contents\nlaw. When new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice, or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made,\nwe may need to implement changes in our policies or structure. We are susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation, especially\nrelating to income and other taxes, import/export laws, hazardous materials and other laws related to trade, accounting and business\nactivities. Such changes in legislation may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer,\nantitrust, intellectual property and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An\nunfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or other adverse effects. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the\npossibility of a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations for the period in which the ruling\noccurred or future periods.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nOur Company maintains a cyber risk management program designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and respond to\ncybersecurity threats. The Board, Risk and Security Committee of the Board and senior management devote significant resources to\ncybersecurity and risk management processes to adapt to the changing cybersecurity landscape and respond to emerging threats in a timely\nand effective manner.\nWe regularly assess the threat landscape with a layered cybersecurity strategy based on prevention, detection, and mitigation. Our\nIT team reviews enterprise risk management-level cybersecurity risks annually. In addition, we have a set of Company-wide policies and\nprocedures concerning cybersecurity matters, such as encryption standards, antivirus protection, remote access, multifactor authentication,\nconfidential information and the use of internet, social media, email, and personal devices. The policies include standards from including,\nbut not limited to, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) framework, Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandards (“PCI-DSS”) and the Center for Internet Security Standards (“CIS”) and are reviewed and approved by appropriate members of\nmanagement. Employees must be aware of the Company’s security policies and acknowledge their understanding and compliance to each\nof the policies annually.\nThe Risk and Security Committee of the Board oversees the Company’s cybersecurity risk exposures and the procedures taken by\nmanagement to monitor and mitigate the cyber risks. The Chief Information Officer oversees the IT team and is responsible for developing\nand implementing our information security program and reporting on cybersecurity matters to the Board and Risk and Security Committee\nof the Board. We view cybersecurity as a shared responsibility, and we periodically perform simulations and tabletop exercises at a\nmanagement level and incorporate external resources and advisors as needed. All employees are required to complete cybersecurity\ntrainings through online training modules. Our IT team regularly monitors alerts and meets to discuss threat levels, trends and remediation\nplans as needed. Additionally, we conduct periodic penetration tests to assess our processes and procedures to ensure we have a robust\ncybersecurity program.\nThe Company faces risks from cybersecurity threats that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, cash flows or overall reputation. Although we will continue to face such risks during our normal course of business,\nthey have not materially affected our business, financial position and results of operations. See “Failure to adequately maintain the security\nof our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations” in\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company leases approximately 20,000 square feet of space in Eatontown, New Jersey for its corporate headquarters under a\nlease expiring in April 2027. Total annual rent expense for this premise is approximately $470,000.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company subleases approximately 7,165 square feet of this space under a sublease expiring in April 2027. Total annual sublease\nincome for this space is approximately $160,000.\nThe Company also leases 7,800 square feet of warehouse space in Eatontown, New Jersey under a lease expiring in December\n2024.

We also rent smaller satellite offices on a short-term basis.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other claims incidental to our business. We review outstanding\nclaims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess probability and amount of potential loss. There are no\nmaterial legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be\nread in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto. This discussion and analysis contains,\nin addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those set forth\nunder the heading “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nOur Company is a value added IT distribution and solutions company, primarily selling software and other third-party IT products\nand services through two reportable operating segments. Through our “Distribution” segment we sell products and services to corporate\nresellers, VAR, consultants and systems integrators worldwide, who in turn sell these products to end users. Through our “Solutions”\nsegment we act as a cloud solutions provider and value-added reseller, selling computer software and hardware developed by others and\nprovide technical services directly to end user customers worldwide. We offer an extensive line of products from leading software vendors\nand tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle\nmanagement and other\n17\nTable of Contents\ntechnically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware. We market these products through creative marketing communications,\nincluding our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, social media, direct e-mail, and printed materials.\nWe have subsidiaries in the United States, Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom and Ireland, through which sales are made.\nFactors Influencing Our Financial Results\nWe derive most of our net sales though the sale of third-party software licenses, maintenance and service agreements. In our\nDistribution segment, sales are impacted by the number of product lines we distribute, and sales penetration of those products into the\nreseller channel, product lifecycle competition, and demand characteristics of the products which we are authorized to distribute. In our\nSolutions segment sales are generally driven by sales force effectiveness and success in providing superior customer service and cloud\nsolutions support, competitive pricing, and flexible payment solutions to our customers. Our sales are also impacted by external factors\nsuch as levels of IT spending and customer demand for products we distribute.\nWe sell in a competitive environment where gross product margins have historically declined due to competition and changes in\nproduct mix towards products where no delivery of a physical product is required. In addition, we grant discounts, allowances, and rebates\nto certain customers, which may vary from period to period, based on volume, payment terms and other criteria. To date, we have been able\nto implement cost efficiencies such as the use of drop shipments, electronic ordering (“EDI”) and other capabilities to be able to operate\nour business profitably as gross margins have declined. We evaluate the profitability of our business based on return on equity and effective\nmargin (see discussion below).\nGross profit is calculated as net sales less cost of sales. We record customer rebates, discounts and returns as a component of net\nsales and record vendor rebates, discounts and returns as a component of cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of employee salaries, commissions and other employee related\nexpenses, facility costs, costs to maintain our IT infrastructure, public company compliance costs and professional fees. We monitor our\nlevel of accounts payable, inventory turnover and accounts receivable turnover which are measures of how efficiently we utilize capital in\nour business.\nThe Company’s sales, gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly\nbasis as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to: the condition of the software industry in general, shifts in demand for\nsoftware products, pricing, industry shipments of new software products or upgrades, fluctuations in merchandise returns, adverse weather\nconditions that affect response, distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in the Company’s product offerings.\nThe Company’s operating expenditures are based on sales forecasts. If sales do not meet expectations in any given quarter, operating results\nmay be materially adversely affected.\nDividend Policy and Share Repurchase Program. Historically we have sought to return value to investors through the payment of\nquarterly dividends and share repurchases. Total dividends paid and the dollar value of shares repurchased were $3.0 million and $1.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and $3.0 million and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nrespectively. The payment of future dividends and any share repurchases are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and dependent on\nresults of operations, projected capital requirements and other factors the Board of Directors may find relevant.\nStock Volatility. The technology, distribution and services sectors of the United States stock markets is subject to substantial\nvolatility. Numerous conditions which impact these sectors or the stock market in general or the Company in particular, whether or not such\nevents relate to or reflect upon the Company’s operating performance, could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s Common\nStock. Furthermore, fluctuations in the Company’s operating results, announcements regarding litigation, the loss of a significant vendor\npartner or customer, increased competition, reduced\n18\nTable of Contents\nvendor incentives and trade credit, higher operating expenses, and other developments, could have a significant impact on the market price\nof our Common Stock.\nInflation. We have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in\ncustomer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of\nthe products we sell to decline. This requires us to sell new products and have growth in unit sales of existing products in order to increase\nour net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our customers, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term\ncontracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be\npassed on to our customers or cause a reduction in our customers spending.\nFinancial Overview\nNet sales increased 16%, or $47.7 million, to $352.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $304.3 million\nfor the same period in 2022. Gross profit increased 19%, or $10.1 million, to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $54.1 million for the same period in 2022. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 30%, or $10.2\nmillion, to $44.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $34.1 million for the same period in 2022. Acquisition related\ncosts for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.6 million, respectively. Amortization and depreciation expense increased\n$0.7 million to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Net\nincome decreased 2%, or $0.2 million, to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $12.5 million for the same\nperiod in 2022. Income per diluted share decreased 3%, or $0.09, to $2.72 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.81 for the\nsame period in 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the\nCompany’s Consolidated Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities.\nOn an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories,\ninvestments, intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are\nnot readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nThe Company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated\nFinancial Statements affect its more significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue\nThe Company utilizes judgment regarding performance obligations inherent in the products for services it sells including, whether\nongoing maintenance obligations performed by third party vendors are distinct from the related software licenses, and allocation of sales\nprices among distinct performance obligations. These estimates require judgment to determine whether the software’s functionality is\ndependent on ongoing maintenance or if substantially all functionality is available in the original software download. We also use judgment\nin the allocation of sales proceeds among performance obligations, utilizing observable data such as stand-alone selling prices, or market\npricing for similar products and services.\n19\nTable of Contents\nAllowances for Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to\nmake required payments. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for expected credit losses by considering a number of\nfactors, including historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our\ncustomers’ ability to make payments for goods and services. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical\nexperience, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If actual sales returns are\ngreater than estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires\nthat we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an\nintegrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors.\nAsset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair\nvalue basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over\nthe net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\nOur valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets that was\nderived using valuation techniques and models such as the income approach. Such models require use of estimates including discount rates,\nand future expected revenue. The approach to estimating an initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses\nsimilar unobservable factors such as projected cash flows over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over\nwhich the initial contingent consideration is measured and expected volatility. Based upon these assumptions, the initial contingent\nconsideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe have used third-party qualified specialists to assist management in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. This includes assistance with the determination of economic useful lives and valuation of identifiable intangibles.\nWe estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may\nchange as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As a result, during the\nmeasurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record certain adjustments to the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nAll acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Contingent consideration is\nremeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is\nrecognized in acquisition related costs in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performs an evaluation of\ngoodwill, utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of October 1. The\nCompany’s reporting units included in the assessment of potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments. Goodwill is\nnot amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nIn a qualitative assessment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of\nmore than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including\n20\nTable of Contents\ngoodwill. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We may also elect the\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIn the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If\nthe fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. Conversely, if the\ncarrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited\nto the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and\nassumptions, including net sales growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among\nothers. Any changes in the judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce significantly different results.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, which\nis determined based on their expected period of benefit. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an\nestimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset\nexceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its\nfair value. In addition, each quarter, the Company evaluates whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining\nestimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful\nlife of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over\nthat revised remaining useful life.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need\nfor the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all\nor part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such\ndetermination was made.\nShare-Based Payments\nUnder the fair value recognition provision, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of\nthe award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We make certain assumptions in order to\nvalue and expense our various share-based payment awards. In connection with our restricted stock programs we record the forfeitures\nwhen they occur. We review our valuation assumptions periodically and, as a result, we may change our valuation assumptions used to\nvalue stock-based awards granted in future periods. Such changes may lead to a significant change in the expense we recognize in\nconnection with share-based payments.\n21\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange\nThe Company’s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from\ncustomers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. In cases where the Company is not able to create a natural\nhedge by maintaining offsetting asset and liability amounts in the same currency, it may enter into foreign exchange contracts, typically in\nthe form of forward purchase agreements, to facilitate the hedging of foreign currency exposures to mitigate the impact of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. These contracts generally have terms of no more than two months. The Company does not apply hedge\naccounting to these contracts and therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. The Company does not enter into foreign\nexchange contracts for trading purposes and the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the\ncounterparties, which the Company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)” (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial\ninstruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. Originally, ASU 2016-13 was effective for fiscal years, and for interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, FASB issued ASU\n2019-10, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU\ndefers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for public companies that are considered smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC to\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Effective January 1, 2023, the\nCompany adopted the new credit loss standard and it did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-03, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income\nStatement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718).” This ASU amends various paragraphs in the accounting codification pursuant to the\nissuance of Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) number 120. The ASU provides clarifying guidance related to employee and\nnon-employee share-based payment accounting, including guidance related to spring-loaded awards. ASU 2023-03 was effective upon\nissuance. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company will adopt the update in the first quarter of 2024\nbut does not expect there to be a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n22\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth for the years indicated the percentage of net sales represented by selected items reflected in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include net sales, adjusted gross billings, gross profit, net\nincome, net income excluding separation expenses, net of taxes, adjusted EBITDA, gross profit as a percentage of adjusted gross billings\nand adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit. We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the operating\nperformance of our business, develop financial forecasts, make strategic decisions, and prepare and approve annual budgets. These key\nindicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with US GAAP and presented in our Consolidated Financial\nStatements as well as non-US GAAP performance measurement tools.\nYear ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\nReconciliation of net sales to adjusted gross billings (Non-GAAP): 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 352,013 $ 304,348\nCosts of sales related to sales where the Company is an agent 908,369 760,310\nAdjusted gross billings $ 1,260,382 $ 1,064,658\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe define adjusted gross billings as net sales in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for the cost of sales related to sales where\nthe Company is an agent. We provided a reconciliation of adjusted gross billings to net sales, which is the most directly comparable US\nGAAP measure. We use adjusted gross billings of product and services as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into\nthe volume of business generated by our business, and to analyze the changes to our accounts receivable and accounts payable. Our use of\nadjusted gross billings of product and services as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as\nsubstitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under US GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our\nindustry, might calculate adjusted gross billings of product and services or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their\nusefulness as comparative measures.\nYear ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\nNet income reconciled to adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP): 2023 2022\nNet income $ 12,323 $ 12,497\nProvision for income taxes 4,458 4,035\nDepreciation and amortization 2,798 2,054\nInterest expense 264 71\nEBITDA 19,843 18,657\nShare-based compensation 4,148 1,897\nAcquisition related costs 629 582\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 24,620 $ 21,136\nWe define adjusted EBITDA, as net income, plus provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share-based\ncompensation, interest, and acquisition related costs. We define effective margin as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of gross profit. We\nprovided a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income, which is the most directly comparable US GAAP measure. We use adjusted\nEBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance to gain insight into our businesses profitability when compared to the prior year\nand our competitors. Adjusted EBITDA is also a component to our financial covenants in our credit facility. Our use of adjusted EBITDA\nhas limitations, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under US\nGAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA, or similarly titled measures\ndifferently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\nKey Financial Metrics\nYear ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet sales $ 352,013 $ 304,348\nAdjusted gross billings (Non-GAAP) $ 1,260,382 $ 1,064,658\nGross profit $ 64,247 $ 54,094\nGross profit - Distribution $ 53,363 $ 44,970\nGross profit - Solutions $ 10,884 $ 9,124\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) $ 24,620 $ 21,136\nGross margin % - Adjusted gross billings (Non-GAAP) 5.1% 5.1%\nEffective margin % - Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) 38.3% 39.1%\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe consider gross profit growth and effective margin to be key metrics in evaluating our business. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, gross profit increased 19%, or $10.1 million, to $64.2 million compared to $54.1 million for the same period in 2022\nwhile effective margin decreased 80 basis points to 38.3% compared to 39.1% for the same period in 2022.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nAcquisitions\nOn October 6, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Data Solutions for an aggregate purchase of approximately €15.0 million\n(equivalent to $15.9 million USD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments, paid at closing plus a potential post-closing\nearn-out. The operating results of Data Solutions are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nThe Company recorded net revenue for Data Solutions of approximately $14.3 million and net income of approximately $0.8\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn August 18, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Spinnakar Limited (“Spinnakar”) for an aggregate purchase price of\napproximately £9.8 million (equivalent to $11.8 million USD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments, paid at closing plus\na potential post-closing earn-out. The operating results of Spinnakar are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition.\nOperating results of Data Solutions and Spinnakar are included in our Distribution segment.\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 16%, or $47.7 million, to $352.0 million compared to $304.3 million\nfor the same period in 2022.\nAdjusted gross billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 18%, or $195.7 million,\nto $1,260.4 million compared to $1,064.7 million for the same period in 2022.\nNet sales in our Distribution segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 15%, or $42.8 million, to $325.3 million\ncompared to $282.5 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted gross billings for the Distribution segment for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 increased 18%, or $178.1 million, to $1,176.9 million compared to $998.8 million for the same period in 2022. Net\nsales and adjusted gross billings increased due to organic growth at our existing vendor lines as well as the impact of the Data Solutions\nacquisition in the current year. Adjusted gross billings increased at a greater rate than net sales due to differences in the product mix\nbetween the two periods.\nNet sales in our Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 22%, or $4.9 million, to $26.8 million\ncompared to $21.8 million for the prior year. Adjusted gross billings for the Solutions segment for the year ended December 31, 2023\nincreased 27%, or $17.6 million, to $83.5 million compared to $65.9 million for the same period in 2022. Adjusted gross billings increased\nat a greater rate than net sales due to differences in the product mix between the two periods.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we relied on two key customers for a total of 35% of our total net sales. One major\ncustomer accounted for 20% and the other for 15%, of our total net sales during the year ended December 31, 2023. These same customers\naccounted for 15% and 6%, of total net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 19%, or $10.1 million, to $64.2 million compared to $54.1 million\nfor the same period in 2022.\n25\nTable of Contents\nDistribution segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased 19%, or $8.4 million, to $53.4 million\ncompared to $45.0 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in Distribution segment gross profit resulted primarily from the\norganic growth at our existing vendor lines, impact of Data Solutions since the date of acquisition, and increased rebates and discounts\nfrom our vendor partners partially offset by higher early pay discounts and other rebates and discounts offered to our customers as a\npercentage of adjusted gross billings.\nSolutions segment gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased 19%, or $1.8 million, to $10.9 million compared\nto $9.1 million for the same period in 2022. This increase was the result of the aforementioned increase in adjusted gross billings.\nCustomer rebates and discounts for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $12.8 million compared to $8.8 million for the same\nperiod in the prior year. Customer rebates and discounts vary based on terms of rebate and early pay discount programs offered to\ncustomers and timing of payments ultimately received from our customers.\nVendor rebates and discounts for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $7.9 million compared to $6.1 million for the same\nperiod in the prior year. Vendor rebates are dependent on programs offered by our vendors and in some cases reaching certain volume\ntargets set by our vendors or meeting certain early payment programs offered by our vendors. The Company monitors vendor rebate levels,\ncompetitive pricing, and gross profit margins carefully. We anticipate that price competition in our market will continue in both of our\nbusiness segments.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased 30%, or $10.2 million, to $44.3 million, compared to $34.1\nmillion for the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher payroll and related costs consistent with higher\ngross profit, as well as the impact of the Data Solutions acquisition. SG&A expenses were 3.7% of adjusted gross billings, a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 3.5% for the same period in the prior year.\nThe Company expects that its SG&A expenses, as a percentage of adjusted gross billings, a non-GAAP financial measure, may\nvary depending on changes in sales volume, as well as the levels of continuing investments in key growth initiatives. We plan to continue to\nexpand our investment in information technology to support the growth of our business.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.6 million, respectively. These expenses in the\ncurrent year relate to costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of Data Solutions, while these expenses in the same period the prior\nyear related to the acquisition of Spinnakar.\nForeign Currency Transaction Loss\nForeign currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.6 million compared to a foreign currency\ntransaction loss of $0.9 million for the same period in the prior year. These expenses primarily relate to the change in the value of accounts\npayable and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currency between the date of\norigination and settlement.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $4.5 million, or 26.6% of income\nbefore taxes, compared to $4.0 million, or 24.4% of income before taxes for the same period in the prior year. The change in the effective\ntax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year is a result of limitations on the deductibility of\ncertain executive compensation amounts during the current period, as well as the Company’s effective tax rate for both periods were\nimpacted by limitations on the deductibility of certain facilitative acquisition related costs.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $16.1 million to $36.3 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $20.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of $42.1 million of cash and cash equivalents\nprovided by operating activities, offset by $12.7 million payment for the Data Solutions acquisition, $5.0 million of cash used in other\ninvesting activities, $8.9 million of cash used in financing activities and $0.5 million positive impact of foreign exchange rates on cash and\ncash equivalents.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $42.1 million, comprised of net income\nadjusted for non-cash items of $19.2 million offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $22.9 million.\nNet cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $17.7 million, comprised\nof $5.0 million of purchases of fixed assets supporting our ongoing ERP project and $12.7 million payment for the Data Solutions\nacquisition, net of cash acquired. On October 6, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Data Solutions for an aggregate purchase price of\napproximately €15.0 million (equivalent to $15.9 million USD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments, paid at closing\nplus a potential post-closing earn-out. The operating results of Data Solutions are included in our operating results from the date of\nacquisition.\nNet cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $8.9 million, comprised\nof net repayments of borrowings under credit facilities of $3.1 million, dividend payments on our Common Stock of $3.0 million,\npurchases of treasury stock of $1.7 million, payments of deferred financing costs of $0.6 million and repayments of borrowing under term\nloan of $0.5 million.\nOn December 3, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an increase of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under its repurchase plans. On February 2, 2017, the Board of Directors\napproved an increase of 500,000 shares of Common Stock to the number of shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under its\nrepurchase plans. The Company is authorized to purchase 545,786 shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2023. The Common Stock\nrepurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held 711,052 shares of our Common Stock in treasury at an average cost of $17.75 per share. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we held 806,068 shares of our Common Stock in treasury at an average cost of $16.41 per share. We intend to hold the\nrepurchased shares in treasury for general corporate purposes, including issuances under various stock plans.\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. (“JPM”), providing for a revolving credit facility of up to $50.0 million subject to a borrowing base, including the issuance of letters\nof credit and swingline loans not to exceed $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, at any time outstanding. In addition, subject to\ncertain conditions enumerated in the Credit Agreement, the Company has the right to increase the revolving credit facility by a total amount\nnot to exceed $20.0 million. The proceeds of the revolving loans, letters of credit and swingline loans under the Credit Agreement may be\nused for working capital needs, general corporate purposes and for acquisitions permitted by the terms of the Credit Agreement. All\noutstanding loans issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement become due and payable, on May 18, 2028. There were no amounts outstanding\nunder the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2023. In connection with entering into the Credit Agreement, the Company voluntarily\nterminated that certain existing revolving credit agreement, dated November 15, 2017, by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of\nthe Company and Citibank, N.A.\nOn April 8, 2022, the Company entered into a $2.1 million term loan (the “Term Loan”) with First American Commercial\nBancorp, Inc. pursuant to a Master Loan and Security Agreement. The proceeds from the Term Loan will be used to fund certain capital\nexpenditures. The borrowing under the Term Loan bears interest at a rate of 3.73% per annum and is being repaid over forty-eight monthly\ninstallments of principal and interest through April 2026. The Company had $1.3 million and $1.8 million outstanding under the Term Loan\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe anticipate that our working capital needs will increase as we invest in the growth of our business. We believe that the funds\nheld in cash and cash equivalents and our unused borrowings under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and\ncash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including access to external\ncapital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.\nForeign Exchange\nThe Company’s foreign business is subject to changes in demand or pricing resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates\nor other factors. We are subject to fluctuations primarily in the Canadian Dollar, Euro Dollar and British Pound-to-U.S. Dollar exchange\nrate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nItem 7A.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management\ncarried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures”, as such\nterm is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. This\nevaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of various members of our management, including our\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer), Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer)\nand Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer (principal accounting officer). Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the\nCompany in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s\nChief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nManagement Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer\nand Chief Accounting Officer, and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with US\nGAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records in reasonable detail that accurately and fairly reflect our\ntransactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our\nfinancial statements in accordance with US GAAP; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company, are\nmade in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and providing reasonable assurance that\nunauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control\n28\nTable of Contents\nover financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or\ndetected. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that, owing to changes in\nconditions, controls may become inadequate, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs previously disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on October 6, 2023 we completed the acquisition of Data Solutions.\nSEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business’ internal control over financial reporting from\nmanagement’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from date of acquisition.\nManagement has excluded from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting the operations and related assets of Data\nSolutions, which the Company began consolidating in October 2023. The operations and related assets of Data Solutions were included in\nthe consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 17% and 2% of total assets and net assets, respectively as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and 4% and 6% of consolidated net sales and net income for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer,\nconducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on\nthis evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, P.C., has audited the effectiveness of the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, has evaluated our internal control over\nfinancial reporting to determine whether any changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Based on that evaluation, no such changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth\nquarter of the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange\nAct) informed us of the adoption or termination of a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”),\nthe consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings,\ncomprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes and schedule and our\nreport dated March 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Controls and Procedures. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards\nrequire that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Data Solutions Holdings Limited, which was acquired on\nOctober 6, 2023 and was included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated\nstatements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Data Solutions Holdings\nLimited constituted 17% and 2% of consolidated total assets and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, and 4% and 6% of\nconsolidated net sales and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Management did not assess the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting of Data Solutions Holdings Limited because of the timing of the acquisition. Our audit of internal control\nover financial reporting of the Company did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Data Solutions\nHoldings Limited.\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWoodbridge, New Jersey\nMarch 5, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc.\nEatontown, New Jersey\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Climb Global Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years\nthen ended, and the related notes and schedule (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”),\nthe Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and our\nreport dated March 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or\nfraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication\nof the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,\nby communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures\nto which it relates.\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nAcquisition – Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAs described in Note 3 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, on October 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Share\nPurchase Agreement and purchased the entire share capital of Data Solutions Holdings Limited (“Data Solutions”) for an aggregate\npurchase price of approximately €15.0 million (equivalent to $15.9 million USD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments,\npaid at closing plus a potential post-closing earn-out. As a result of the acquisition, management determined the estimated fair value of the\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and recorded an $8.3 million intangible asset related to vendor\nrelationships.\nWe identified the discount rate used in the determination of the fair value of acquired vendor relationships as a critical audit matter. The\nprincipal considerations for our determination included the subjectivity and judgment required to determine the discount rate. Auditing this\nelement involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address this matter,\nincluding the extent of specialized skills and knowledge needed.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n● Utilizing personnel with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in developing an independent discount rate and comparing it to\nthe rate used by the Company to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate used in the determination of the fair value of the\nacquired vendor relationships.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\nWoodbridge, New Jersey\nMarch 5, 2024\nF-5\nTable of Contents\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc. and

Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nNote 1. Description of Business\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”), was incorporated in Delaware in 1982. The Company distributes\ntechnology products developed by others to resellers who in turn sell to end customers worldwide. The Company also is a cloud solutions\nprovider and value-added reseller of software, hardware and services to customers worldwide. The Company also operates in Canada, the\nUnited Kingdom and Europe. The Company offers an extensive line of products from leading software vendors and tools for\nvirtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other\ntechnically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.\nThe Company is organized into two reportable operating segments. The “Distribution” segment distributes technical software to\ncorporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide under the name “Climb Channel\nSolutions”. The “Solutions” segment is a cloud solutions provider and value-added reseller of software, hardware and services to customers\nworldwide under the names “Grey Matter”.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Operations\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Climb Global Solutions, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires\nthat we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an\nintegrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors.\nAsset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair\nvalue basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over\nthe net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\nOur valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets that was\nderived using valuation techniques and models such as the income approach. Such models require use of estimates including discount rates,\nand future expected revenue. The approach to estimating an initial contingent consideration associated with the purchase price also uses\nsimilar unobservable factors such as projected cash flows over the term of the contingent earn-out period, discounted for the period over\nwhich the initial contingent consideration is measured and expected volatility. Based upon these assumptions, the initial contingent\nconsideration is then valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nWe have used third-party qualified specialists to assist management in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed. This includes assistance with the determination of economic useful lives and valuation of identifiable intangibles.\nWe estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from our estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may\nchange as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nassumed. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record certain\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nAll acquisition-related costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Contingent consideration is\nremeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is\nrecognized in acquisition related costs in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“US GAAP”) requires management to make extensive use of certain estimates and assumptions which affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant areas of estimation include but are not limited to\naccounting for allowance for expected credit losses, sales returns, allocation of revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements, principal vs.\nagent considerations, income taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, contingencies and stock-based compensation. Actual\nresults could differ from those estimates.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nOur basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation\nmethod that determines net income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to their participation\nrights in dividends and undistributed earnings or losses. Non-vested restricted stock awards that include non-forfeitable rights to dividends\nare considered participating securities. Per share amounts are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the\nweighted average shares outstanding during each period. Diluted and basic earnings per share are the same because the restricted shares are\nthe only potentially dilutive security.\nA reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations follows:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 12,323 $ 12,497\nLess distributed and undistributed income allocated to participating securities 323 317\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 12,000 12,180\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares (Basic) 4,401 4,331\nWeighted average common shares including assumed conversions (Diluted) 4,401 4,331\nBasic net income per share $ 2.72 $ 2.81\nDiluted net income per share $ 2.72 $ 2.81\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash\nequivalents.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable principally represents amounts collectible from our customers. The Company performs ongoing credit\nevaluations of its customers but generally does not require collateral to support any outstanding obligation. From time to time, we sell\naccounts receivable to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis for cash, less a discount. The Company has no significant retained\ninterests or servicing liabilities related to the accounts receivable sold. Proceeds from the sale of receivables approximated their discounted\nbook value and were included in operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAllowances for Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to\nmake required payments. Management determines the estimate of the allowance for expected credit losses by considering a number of\nfactors, including historical experience, aging of the accounts receivable, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our\ncustomers’ ability to make payments for goods and services. At the time of sale, we record an estimate for sales returns based on historical\nexperience, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If actual sales returns are\ngreater than estimated by management, an additional returns allowance may be required as an offset to net sales.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs, such as financial advisory and other professional fees are capitalized and recognized in interest, net over\nthe life of the related debt instrument using the straight-line method. Deferred financing costs associated with the Company’s revolving\ncredit facility are presented as an asset, within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries have been translated using the end of the reporting period exchange\nrates, and related revenues and expenses have been translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. Cumulative\ntranslation adjustments have been classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’\nequity in accordance FASB ASC Topic No. 220, “Comprehensive Income”. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded as\nincome or expenses as amounts are settled.\nFor foreign currency remeasurement from each local currency into the appropriate functional currency, monetary assets and\nliabilities are remeasured to functional currencies using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses from these\nremeasurements have been included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are\nrecorded at historical exchange rates.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations in credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company’s cash and cash\nequivalents are deposited primarily in banking institutions with global operations. The Company has not experienced any losses in such\naccounts. The Company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable\napproximated fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, because of the relative short maturity of\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nthese instruments. The Company’s accounts receivable-long-term is discounted to its present value at prevailing market rates at the time of\nsale which, approximates fair value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInventory\nInventory, consisting primarily of finished products held for resale, is valued based on the first-in-first-out method of accounting\nand is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nEquipment and Leasehold Improvements\nEquipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost or fair value, if purchased as part of a business combination. Equipment\ndepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-\nline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms, whichever is shorter.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal-use software. Capitalized\nsoftware costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nCompany had unamortized software development costs of $6.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, which are included in \"Equipment\nand leasehold improvements\" in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, this includes $6.9 million for an\ninternal-use software project that amortization expense has not yet been recognized for as the internal-use software is not ready for its\nintended use. As of December 31, 2022, there were $2.3 million in capitalized costs for this project.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company performs an evaluation of\ngoodwill, utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative impairment test. The annual test for impairment is conducted as of October 1. The\nCompany’s reporting units included in the assessment of potential goodwill impairment are the same as its operating segments. Goodwill is\nnot amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment at the reporting unit level.\nIn a qualitative assessment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of\nmore than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If, after assessing the\ntotality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its\ncarrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nIf, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a\nreporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We may also elect the\nunconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIn the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If\nthe fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. Conversely, if the\ncarrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited\nto the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of estimates and assumptions, including\nnet sales growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. Any changes in\nthe judgments, estimates or assumptions used could produce different results.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with determinable lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, which\nis determined based on their expected period of benefit. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an\nestimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the carrying amount of an asset\nexceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset's carrying amount over its\nfair value. In addition, each quarter, the Company evaluates whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining\nestimated useful life of each of these intangible assets. If the Company were to determine that a change to the remaining estimated useful\nlife of an intangible asset was necessary, then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over\nthat revised remaining useful life.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of net income for the year and the impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments.\nThe foreign currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in\ninternational subsidiaries.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenues primarily result from the sale of various technology products and services, including third-party\nproducts, third-party software and third-party maintenance, software support and services. The Company recognizes revenue as control of\nthe third-party products and third-party software is transferred to customers, which generally happens at the point of shipment or fulfilment\nand at the point that our customers and vendors accept the terms and conditions of the arrangement for third-party maintenance, software\nsupport and services.\nThe Company has contracts with certain customers where the Company’s performance obligation is to arrange for the products or\nservices to be provided by another party. In these arrangements, as the Company assumes an agency relationship in the transaction, revenue\nis recognized in the amount of the net fee associated with serving as an agent. These arrangements primarily relate to third party\nmaintenance, cloud services and certain security software whose intended functionality is dependent on third party maintenance.\nThe Company allows its customers to return product for exchange or credit subject to certain limitations. A liability is recorded at\nthe time of sale for estimated product returns based upon historical experience and an asset is recognized for the amount expected to be\nrecorded upon product return. The Company also provides rebates and other discounts to certain customers which are considered variable\nconsideration. A provision for customer rebates and other discounts is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based on an\nevaluation of the contract terms and historical experience.\nThe Company considers shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill the sales of products. Shipping revenue is included in\nnet sales when control of the product is transferred to the customer, and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of\nsales. Taxes imposed by governmental authorities on the Company’s revenue producing activities with customers, such as sales taxes and\nvalue added taxes, are excluded from net sales.\nThe Company disaggregates its operating revenue by segment, geography and timing of revenue recognition, which the Company\nbelieves provides a meaningful depiction of the nature of its revenue. For additional information, see Note 13 (Industry, Segment and\nGeographic Information).\nHardware and software products sold by the Company are generally delivered via shipment from the Company’s facilities, drop\nshipment directly from the vendor, or by electronic delivery of keys for software products. The majority of the Company’s business\ninvolves shipments directly from its vendors to its customers, in these transactions, the Company is generally responsible for negotiating\nprice both with the vendor and customer, payment to the vendor, establishing payment terms with the customer, product returns, and has\nrisk of loss if the customer does not make payment. As the principal with the customer, the Company recognizes revenue upon receiving\nnotification from the vendor that the product\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nwas shipped. Control of software products is deemed to have passed to the customer when they acquire the right to use or copy the software\nunder license as substantially all product functionality is available to the customer at the time of sale.\nThe Company performs an analysis of the number of days of sales in-transit to customers at the end of each reporting period based\non an analysis of commercial delivery terms that include drop-shipment arrangements. This analysis is the basis upon which the Company\nestimates the amount of net sales in-transit at the end of the period and adjusts revenue and the related costs to reflect only what has been\ndelivered to the customer. Changes in delivery patterns may result in a different number of business days estimated to make this\nadjustment. The Company also performs a weighted average analysis of the estimated number of days between order fulfillment and\nbeginning of the renewal term for term licenses recorded on a gross basis, and a deferral estimate is recorded for term license renewals\nfulfilled prior to commencement date.\nGenerally, software products are sold with accompanying third-party delivered software assurance, which is a product that allows\ncustomers to upgrade, at no additional cost, to the latest technology if new capabilities are introduced during the period that the software\nassurance is in effect. The Company evaluates whether the software assurance is a separate performance obligation by assessing if the\nthird-party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software itself. This involves considering if\nthe software provides its original intended functionality to the customer without the updates, if the customer would ascribe a higher value to\nthe upgrades versus the up-front deliverable, if the customer would expect frequent intelligence updates to the software (such as updates\nthat maintain the original functionality), and if the customer chooses to not delay or always install upgrades. If the Company determines\nthat the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance is critical or essential to the core functionality of the software license, the\nsoftware license and the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance are recognized as a single performance obligation. The\nvalue of the product is primarily the accompanying support delivered by a third party and therefore the Company is acting as an agent in\nthese transactions and recognizes them on a net basis at the point the associated software license is delivered to the customer. The Company\nsells cloud computing solutions that utilize third-party vendors to enable customers to access data center functionality in a cloud-based\nsolution, including storage, computing and networking and access to software in the cloud that enhances office productivity, provides\nsecurity or assists in collaboration. The Company recognizes revenue for cloud computing solutions for arrangements with one-time\ninvoicing to the customer at the time of invoice on a net basis as the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction. For monthly\nsubscription-based arrangements, the Company is acting as an agent in the transaction and recognizes revenue as it invoices the customer\nfor its monthly usage on a net basis. For software licenses where the accompanying third-party delivered software assurance is not critical\nor essential to the core functionality, the software assurance is recognized as a separate performance obligation, with the associated revenue\nrecognized on a net basis at the point the related software license is delivered to the customer.\nThe Company also sells some of its products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements containing multiple\ndeliverables, which may include a combination of products and services. For each deliverable that represents a distinct performance\nobligation, total arrangement consideration is allocated based upon the standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of each performance obligation.\nSSP is determined based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable\nthrough established standard prices, we use judgement and estimate the standalone selling price considering available information such as\nmarket pricing and pricing related to similar products.\nFreight\nThe Company records freight billed to its customers as net sales and the related freight costs as cost of sales when the underlying\nproduct revenue is recognized. For freight not billed to its customers, the Company records the freight costs as cost of sales. The\nCompany’s typical shipping terms result in shipping being performed before the customer obtains control of the product. The Company\nconsiders shipping to be a fulfillment activity and not a separate performance obligation.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nCommissions\nThe Company pays commissions and related payroll taxes to sales personnel when customers are invoiced. These costs are\nrecorded as selling general and administrative expenses in the period earned as all our performance obligations are complete within a short\nwindow of processing the order.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company has stockholder-approved stock incentive plans for employees and directors. Stock-based compensation is\nrecognized based on the grant date fair value and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nOperating Segments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is\nevaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The\nCompany's operations are classified into two reportable business segments: Distribution and Solutions. For additional information, see\nNote 13 (Industry, Segment and Geographic Information).\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is accounted for at cost. Shares repurchased by the Company are held in treasury for general corporate purposes,\nincluding issuances under equity incentive plans. The reissuance of shares from treasury stock is based on the weighted average purchase\nprice of the shares.\nInterest, net\nInterest, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and income from the amortization of the\ndiscount on accounts receivable long term, net of interest expense on the Company’s credit facility.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using\nenacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. This method also requires a valuation\nallowance against the net deferred tax asset if, based on the weighted available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all the\ndeferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in\nincome tax expense when assessed. The Company accounts for uncertainties in accordance with FASB ASC 740 “Income Taxes”. This\nstandard clarified the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. The standard prescribes criteria for recognition and measurement of tax\npositions. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and disclosures related to income taxes\nassociated with uncertain tax positions. The Company classifies all deferred tax asset or liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange\nThe Company’s foreign currency exposure relates primarily to international transactions where the currency collected from\ncustomers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product. In cases where the Company is not able to create a natural\nhedge by maintaining offsetting asset and liability amounts in the same currency, it may enter into foreign exchange contracts, typically in\nthe form of forward purchase agreements, to facilitate the hedging of foreign currency exposures to mitigate the impact of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. These contracts generally have terms of no more than two months. The Company does not apply hedge\naccounting to these contracts and therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. The Company does not enter into foreign\nexchange contracts for trading purposes and the risk of loss on a foreign exchange contract is the risk of nonperformance by the\ncounterparties, which the Company minimizes by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)”\n(\"ASU 2016-13\"). ASU 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such\nlosses are recorded. Originally, ASU 2016-13 was effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments – Credit\nLosses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for\npublic companies that are considered smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the new credit loss standard and\nit did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-03, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income\nStatement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505),\nCompensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718).” This ASU amends various paragraphs in the accounting codification pursuant to the\nissuance of Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) number 120. The ASU provides clarifying guidance related to employee and\nnon-employee share-based payment accounting, including guidance related to spring-loaded awards. ASU 2023-03 was effective upon\nissuance. The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures”. The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The Company will adopt the update in the first quarter of 2024\nbut does not expect there to be a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n3. Acquisition\nAcquisition of Data Solutions Holdings Limited\nOn October 6, 2023, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement and purchased the entire share capital of Data\nSolutions Holdings Limited (“Data Solutions”) for an aggregate purchase price of approximately €15.0 million (equivalent to $15.9 million\nUSD), subject to certain working capital and other adjustments, paid at closing plus a potential post-closing earn-out. The allocation of the\npurchase price was based on the estimated fair value of Data Solutions’ net tangible and identifiable intangible assets as of the date of the\nacquisition. The transaction was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.\nThe financial position and operating results of Data Solutions is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from\nthe date of the acquisition. The Company recorded net revenue for Data Solutions of approximately $14.3 million and net income of\napproximately $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nThe impact of the acquisition’s preliminary purchase price allocations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and the\nacquisition date fair value of the total consideration transferred is depicted in the table below. Due to the timing of the closing of the\ntransaction in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company has not yet completed its evaluation and determination of certain assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, primarily the final valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and the final evaluation and assessment of income tax\naccounts; therefore, the final fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will be completed within the measurement\nperiod of up to one year from the acquisition date, may vary from the Company’s preliminary estimates:\n(in thousands)\nCash $ 3,190\nAccounts receivable 32,503\nInventory 2,460\nOther current assets 99\nEquipment and leasehold improvements 800\nVendor relationships (10-year weighted average useful life) 8,269\nGoodwill 7,143\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities (34,793)\nDeferred tax liability (1,576)\nNet assets $ 18,095\n(in thousands)\nSupplementary information:\nCash paid to sellers $ 15,868\nContingent earn-out 2,227\nTotal purchase consideration $ 18,095\nCash paid to sellers 15,868\nCash acquired in acquisition (3,190)\nNet cash paid for acquisition $ 12,678\nIntangible assets are comprised of approximately $8.3 million of vendor relationships with a weighted average amortization period\nof 10 years, representing the expected period of benefits. Goodwill, which was allocated to the Distribution segment, is the excess of the\nconsideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected revenue and cost synergies of the combined company\nand assembled workforce. Goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company used the income approach to value the intangible assets, representing acquired vendor relationships. The fair value\nmeasurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable, which are categorized as a Level 3 measurement in the\nfair value hierarchy (See Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements). Inputs used to value these intangible assets include the discount rate,\nprojection of all future cash flows, long-term growth rates, vendor attrition rates and applicable income tax rates. The excess purchase price\nrecorded to goodwill primarily represents the future economic benefits the Company expects to achieve as a result of combining operations\nand expanding vendor relationships.\nThe purchase consideration includes approximately $2.2 million fair value for potential earn-out consideration if certain targets are\nachieved, payable in cash. The earn-out liability is included in current liabilities as of December 31, 2023. There were no material changes\nin fair value since the acquisition date. The fair value earn-out measurement was primarily based on inputs that are not observable, which\nare categorized as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy (See Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements), reflecting its assessment of\nthe assumptions market participants\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nwould use to value these liabilities. The undiscounted payment of the earn-out can range from zero up to approximately $3.9 million and\nachievement is based on the post-acquisition results of Data Solutions.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Data Solutions on October 6, 2023, the Company acquired an invoice discounting facility\n(“IDF”) that is with recourse to the Company (See Note 8 – Credit Facilities). The balance outstanding under the IDF at December 31,\n2023 was $4.3 million, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAcquisition related costs remained consistent at approximately $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, which is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined under US GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy has been established for valuation inputs to\nprioritize the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each\nfair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair\nvalue measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\nLevel 1 – observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel 2 – inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\ninstruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the\nmarket or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.\nThe Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nTreasury bills $ 5,096 $ — $ — $ 5,096\nTotal assets $ 5,096 $ — $ — $ 5,096\nLiabilities:\nContingent earn-out $ — $ — $ 4,189 $ 4,189\nTotal liabilities $ — $ — $ 4,189 $ 4,189\nAs of December 31, 2022\nAssets:\nTreasury bills $ — $ — $ — $ —\nTotal assets $ — $ — $ — $ —\nLiabilities:\nContingent earn-out $ — $ — $ 1,777 $ 1,777\nTotal liabilities $ — $ — $ 1,777 $ 1,777\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\nuse of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources,\nwhile unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions based on the best information available. The approach to estimating the\ncontingent earn-out associated with the Company’s business combinations uses unobservable factors such as projected cash flows over the\nterm of the contingent earn-out periods.\nThe Company’s investment in treasury bills are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted market prices in active\nmarkets and are classified as level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s contingent earn-out liability is measured at fair value\non a recurring basis and is classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of each year, the Company\nevaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company uses qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely\nthan not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform\na goodwill impairment test. This measurement is classified based on level 3 input.\nThe following table presents the changes in the Company’s level 3 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis:\nBalance January 1, 2022 $ —\nSpinnakar acquisition - contingent earn-out 1,771\nTranslation adjustments 6\nBalance December 31, 2022 $ 1,777\nData Solutions acquisition - contingent earn-out 2,227\nTranslation adjustments 185\nBalance December 31, 2023 $ 4,189\nThere were no material changes in fair value since the respective acquisition dates associated with the contingent earn-outs.\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSchedule II--Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n(Amounts in thousands)\nCharged to\nBeginning Cost and Ending\nDescription Balance Expense Deductions Balance\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 881 $ 19 $ 58 $ 842\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nAllowance for expected credit losses (1) $ 842 $ 54 $ 187 $ 709\n(1) Previously referred to as Allowance for doubtful accounts.\nF-33\nExhibit 4.3\nDESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S\nSECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO\nSECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE\nACT OF 1934\nClimb Global Solutions, Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “our”) has one class of securities registered under Section\n12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which is our common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share (“Common Stock”). The following summary of the material terms of our Common Stock is qualified by\nreference to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) and our Amended\nand Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), each of which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K, as well as applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”).\nCapitalization\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000 shares of preferred\nstock, par value $0.01 per share (“Preferred Stock”).\nCommon Stock\nHolders of our Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions when authorized by our\nBoard of Directors and declared by us out of assets legally available for the payment thereof. Holders of our Common\nStock are also entitled, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\nCompany, to receive a pro rata distribution of any remaining assets after payment or provision for payment of our debts\nor liabilities. These rights are subject to the preferential rights of any Preferred Stock outstanding at any time.\nEach share of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by the\nstockholders of the Company, including the election of Directors. Except as provided by the terms of any outstanding\nPreferred Stock, our common stockholders will possess exclusive voting power. Cumulative voting in the election of\nDirectors is not permitted. Directors will be elected by a plurality of voting power of the shares of capital stock of the\nCompany which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote in the election of Directors at a duly called\nmeeting at which a quorum is present. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of\ncapital stock of the Company which are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon cast at a meeting of\nstockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter which may\nproperly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the votes present is required by law or the Certificate\nof Incorporation.\nHolders of our Common Stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, sinking fund or conversion rights.\nThe rights, preferences and privileges of holders of our Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by,\nthe rights of the holders of shares of any series of Preferred Stock which we may designate and issue in the future.\nOur Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “CLMB.”\nPreferred Stock\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without further action by our\nstockholders, to establish one or more series of Preferred Stock and to determine, with respect to any series of Preferred\nStock, the voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and with such designations, preferences and relative,\nparticipating, optional or other rights, and qualifications or restrictions thereof. As a result, our Board of Directors could\nauthorize the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock that have priority over shares of our Common Stock with respect to\ndividends or other distributions or rights upon liquidation, voting rights or with other terms and conditions that could\nhave the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our Company. As of the\ndate hereof, we have no outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.\nCertain Provisions of Delaware Law and Our Charter and Bylaws\nOur Board of Directors\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the number of Directors of our Company may not be fewer than\nthree and may be fixed only by the resolution of Directors then in office. Subject to the rights of the holders of any\noutstanding Preferred Stock, any vacancy in the Board of Directors (including a vacancy caused by an increase in the\nnumber of Directors) may be filled solely by resolution adopted by a majority of Directors then in office, whether or not\nsuch majority constitutes less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining Director; provided however that any vacancy\ncreated by a removal of a Director by the stockholders may be filled by action of the stockholders taken at the same\nmeeting at which the vacancy was created; such action to be upon the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of Directors, voting as a\nsingle class. Subject to the rights of holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock to elect Directors or to remove Directors\nso elected, a Director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of Directors, voting as a\nsingle class.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nSpecial meetings of stockholders of the Company may be called only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of\nthe Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, our President or the record holders of at least 35% of the voting\npower of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company.\nAmendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nAny amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation must first be declared advisable by our Board of Directors\nand, if required by the DGCL or our Certificate of Incorporation, thereafter be approved by a majority of the outstanding\nshares entitled to vote on the amendment, and a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote thereon\nas a class. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the affirmative vote of stockholders holding 66-2/3% of the\noutstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote thereon shall be required in order to amend any provision of, or\nto adopt any provision which is inconsistent with, Article V (Board of Directors; Stockholders’ Meetings), Article VI\n(Director Liability) or Article VII (Amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation) of our Certificate of\nIncorporation. Our Bylaws may be amended by a majority of our Board of Directors in office and may also be amended\nby the affirmative vote of stockholders holding not less than 66-2/3% of the voting power of the Company then entitled\nto vote thereon.\nRequirements for Advance Notice of Stockholder Proposals and Nominations\nExcept as provided in Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, a stockholder who intends to propose business at an\nannual or special meeting of the stockholders of the Company must comply with the notice,\ninformational requirements and procedures set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. Pursuant to our\nCertificate of Incorporation a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal\nexecutive offices of the Company not later than the earlier to occur of (i) the date which is 60 days prior to the meeting\nand (ii) the date determined by the Company in compliance with the Exchange Act as the last date on which stockholder\nproposals may be submitted to the Company for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials; provided that, if the\nCompany provides less than 60 days’ notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting, to be timely, any such\nstockholder proposal must be received no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which\nsuch notice or prior disclosure was made, whichever first occurs.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Law\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 generally prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging\nin a business combination with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years following the date on which the\nstockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n● prior to the date of the business combination, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the\nbusiness combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested\nstockholder;\n● upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder,\nthe interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time\nthe transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the\noutstanding voting stock owned by the interested stockholder)\n(a) shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and (b) shares owned by employee stock\nplans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held\nsubject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n● on or subsequent to the date of the business combination, the business combination is approved by the board\nof directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by\n-\nthe affirmative vote of at least 662/3% of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested\nstockholder.\nThe term “interested stockholder” is defined generally as any person who is the owner of 15% or more of the\ncorporation’s outstanding voting stock or any person who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner\nof 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock at any time within the three-year period immediately prior\nto the date on which it is sought to be determined whether such person is an interested stockholder, and the affiliates and\nassociates of such person.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions\nCertain provisions of the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws summarized above may have an\nanti-takeover effect and could make the following transactions more difficult: acquisition of the Company by means of a\ntender offer; acquisition of the Company by means of a proxy contest or otherwise; or removal of the Company’s\nincumbent officers and directors. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could\ndeter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in the best interests of the\nCompany, including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of our Common Stock.\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries (Active)\nName Jurisdiction of Organization\nClimb Channel Solutions, Inc.

For Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of erroneously\nawarded compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in an accounting restatement: (i) The\namount must be based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the accounting restatement on the stock price or total shareholder\nreturn upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received; and (ii) The Company must maintain documentation of the\ndetermination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq.\n“Executive Officer” shall mean each individual who the Company determines is an “officer” of the Company in accordance\nwith Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n“Financial Reporting Measures” shall mean measures that are determined and presented in accordance with the accounting\nprinciples used in preparing the Company’s financial statements, and all other measures that are derived wholly or in part from such\nmeasures.

Capitalized terms\nused but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Policy.\nAs a condition to the receipt of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Received on and after the Effective Date, I acknowledge\nand agree to be fully bound by and, subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Policy both during and after my employment with\nthe Company terminates, and to return or reimburse any Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the extent required by, and in a\nmanner required by, the Policy. I further understand and acknowledge that the Policy applies to me, and all of my beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, administrators or other legal representatives, and that the Company’s right to recovery in order to comply with applicable\nlaw will apply, regardless of the terms of any release of claims, separation agreement, employment agreement, grant agreement or\nincentive plan document that I have signed or will sign in the future, or in which I participate or will participate in the future.\nTo the extent the Policy conflicts with any other indemnification, contractual or other rights (now or hereafter in effect) I may have\nwith the Company, I understand and agree that the terms of the Policy shall supersede any such rights with respect to any Incentive-\nBased Compensation Received on and after the Effective Date. The recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy\nwill not give rise to any right to voluntarily terminate employment by me for “good reason” or due to a “constructive termination” (or\nany similar term of like effect) under any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates.\n___________________________Signature\n___________________________Name\n___________________________Date"
