          "content": "Etsy, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nEtsy’s Board of Directors Approves a new $1B Stock Repurchase Program\nBrooklyn, NY - October 30, 2024 - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate\nand creative buyers and sellers around the world, today announced results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n“Our third quarter consolidated results came in roughly as anticipated, with some incremental pressure on Etsy marketplace year-over-year GMS,\nhealthy growth in revenue, and continued strength in our adjusted EBITDA profitability,” said Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. Chief Executive Officer.\n”We made excellent progress improving Etsy marketplace customer experiences - from Gifting, to Quality, a new loyalty program, investing in our\napp, and more - all of which we believe will drive engagement and frequency over time. While 2024 has been a challenging period for\ndiscretionary goods, we are investing with discipline and focus to make Etsy even more Etsy - which we believe will lift our boat when the tide\ncomes back in again.”\nThird quarter 2024 performance highlights include:\n• Consolidated GMS was $2.9 billion, down 4.1% year-over-year and down 4.4% on a currency-neutral basis. Consolidated GMS\nperformance includes a small headwind from the divestiture of Elo7.\n• Etsy marketplace GMS was $2.5 billion, down 6.0% year-over-year and down 6.3% on a currency-neutral basis.\n◦ We’ve continued to see year-over-year gifting GMS1 trends outpace sitewide performance and represent a higher share of overall\nGMS than the same period last year.\n◦ Active buyers decreased 0.4% year-over-year to 91.2 million.\n◦ We reactivated 6.4 million buyers, up 5.6% from the prior year period, and acquired 5.3 million new buyers. Our retention of active\nbuyers remains above pre-pandemic levels on a trailing twelve month basis, as does our quarterly new buyer additions.\n◦ GMS per active buyer on a trailing twelve month basis for the Etsy marketplace declined 3.4% year-over-year to $123 in the third\nquarter.\n◦ Our number of habitual buyers was 6.8 million, down 4.8% year-over-year.\n◦ U.S. domestic GMS represented 51% of overall GMS and GMS ex-U.S. domestic was 49% of overall GMS.\n• Consolidated revenue was $662.4 million, up 4.1% versus the third quarter of 2023, with a take rate (i.e., consolidated revenue divided by\nconsolidated GMS) of 22.7%. Our positive revenue growth was driven by growth in both Marketplace and Services revenue, with payments\nrevenue driving Marketplace revenue performance, and Etsy Ads the primary driver of Services revenue growth.\n• Consolidated net income was $57.4 million, down $30.5 million year-over-year. Consolidated net income margin (i.e., net income divided\nby revenue) was approximately 8.7% and diluted net income per share was $0.45.\n• Consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $183.6 million, with consolidated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., consolidated\nnon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated revenue) of approximately 27.7%.\n• Etsy ended the third quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments. Under Etsy’s stock\nrepurchase program, during the third quarter of 2024 Etsy repurchased an aggregate of approximately $156 million, or 2.7 million shares,\nof its common stock. These shares were purchased pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan.\n“We continue to balance long-term growth investments with delivering strong and sustainable profitability,” said Rachel Glaser, Chief Financial\nOfficer. “Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was about 28%, ahead of our guidance, with excellent revenue flow through - benefiting primarily\nfrom healthy growth in both our Marketplace and Services segments, and continued cost efficiencies. We continue to drive leverage in product\ndevelopment, offset somewhat by increased marketing spend in the quarter as Etsy expanded investments in paid social and newer performance\nmarketing channels, and Depop leaned in to both performance and brand marketing aligned with its growth opportunity.”\nEarlier today, Etsy’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of\nour common stock.\n1Etsy Gifting GMS: Estimate based upon word ‘gift’ in the listing title, shipped with a gift message, or other signal the item was purchased as a gift.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary\n(in thousands, except percentages; unaudited)\nThe financial results of Elo7 have been included in our consolidated financial results (“Consolidated”) until August 10, 2023 (date of sale).

In 2024, we are focused on\nbuilding buyer consideration by making it easier to ‘find the best stuff’ on Etsy, driving association that Etsy sellers offer great value, and\nmaking shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable. The below highlights some of our key initiatives:\nProduct Highlights:\nIn order to drive buyer Consideration, we are making progress in our efforts to position Etsy as an indispensable partner for Gifting, with broad\nbased investments positively impacting our performance. We:\n• Strengthened the relevance and tripled the number of Gift Ideas available to buyers within Gift Mode since launch. There are now\napproximately 5,000 suggestions to help inspire buyers and put them on the path to finding the perfect present.\n• Increased buyer adoption of existing Gifting features: 1.3 million incremental visits from people who received Gift Teasers and came\ndirectly to Etsy, and approximately 1.1 million Gift Lists have been created.\n• Launched physical Etsy gift cards at major U.S. pharmacies and retailers, creating new opportunities to increase consideration.\nAdditionally, starting today, U.S. customers can purchase and ship physical gift cards directly from Etsy.com.\n• U.S. buyer survey data we are tracking for Gifting indicates Etsy’s unprompted association with Gifting hit a record high during the third\nquarter.\nTo help buyers ‘find the best stuff on Etsy,’ we invested in the following Quality initiatives:\n• Worked to enhance the precision of the application of our new \"Creativity Standards\" and associated listing descriptors, which show\nbuyers whether items are made, designed, handpicked, or sourced by Etsy sellers.\n• Based upon experimentation during the quarter, our efforts to more deeply incorporate listing quality attributes into search appear to\nbe leading to an increase in the number of 4 and 5 star buyer reviews, and a decrease in the rate at which buyers requested refunds –\nboth of which indicate shoppers are becoming happier with their experiences on Etsy.\n• Launched the Etsy Search Visibility Page with actionable insights to help sellers improve their positions in search, including insights on\nlisting image quality and quantity, return policies, message response times, and shipping charges for certain listings. So far, we have\nseen more sellers acting on these insights than we anticipated. For example, providing sellers with information on buyer expectations\nhas contributed to lower shipping charges on approximately 2.5 million items.\n• Expanded the diversity of merchandise we are showing buyers, with a goal to reduce the cognitive load experienced when search\nresults deliver too many similar items. Our latest efforts resulted in a 67% reduction in the number of searches with at least four\nidentical listing images on the first page. We are now expanding our capabilities to incorporate items with similar listing images, not\njust those that feature ‘exact matches.’\nAligned with our efforts to make shopping on Etsy more reliable and dependable, we began testing new ways for buyers to access support more\neasily through prominent support links in user profiles and conversational AI within the Help Center.\nWe deepened investments in the buy on Etsy app as part of efforts to make the app our marquee shopping experience. We introduced bolder\nprompts on mobile web, with a focus on driving buyers to download the app.\nDue to significant strides made in optimizing how we bid on behalf of our sellers, which resulted in better balancing of seller ad value across\nseller segments, Etsy Ads revenue performance accelerated on a year-over-year and sequential basis. We also incorporated more features and\nmultimodal embeddings into our ranking models (capturing listing image representations), which led to an improvement in ads conversion rates.\nMarketing Highlights:\nWe invited highly targeted groups of occasional U.S. buyers to join our new Etsy Insider Loyalty program. Etsy Insider is buyer-fee based, offering\nfree U.S. domestic shipping on millions of items, item discounts, first access merchandise and other benefits. The program, which currently\noffers seasonal and annual options, has been launched in beta form, and we will be testing and iterating to determine its impact on frequency\nand loyalty over time.\nWe ran full funnel marketing campaigns in the United States and United Kingdom, which featured real Etsy sellers and highlighted our unique\npositioning. Our buyer research shows that the campaign’s top themes of ‘supporting small,’ ‘originally made,’ and ‘handcrafted’ resonated with\nbuyers.\nWe continued to scale mid-funnel paid social channels to diversify our channel portfolio mix. In line with our Quality efforts, we leveraged\nmachine learning models to adjust offsite marketing feeds, making more room for the very best of Etsy by suppressing or removing listings with\npatterns of poor service quality.\n• Reverb continues to lean into affordable used and like-new gear for budget-minded musicians:\n◦ Following the launch of the Reverb Outlet in late June, Outlet & Exclusive music gear continues to outperform other inventory\ncategories, seeing double-digit percentage year-over-year growth during a challenging time for the musical instrument\nindustry.\n◦ In August, Reverb and Fender, one of the world’s leading guitar manufacturers, launched Fender’s first Certified Pre-Owned\nprogram. Used gear U.S. sales on Reverb continue to outpace new music gear sales, and, this program offers musicians\nprofessionally inspected pre-owned gear with warranties and easy returns.\n◦ Reverb made it easier for sellers to access data on competitive pricing and insights about engagement with their listings,\nwhich led to a significant increase in listings sold, as well as price drops and listings published.\n• Depop evolved its U.S. fee structure, mirroring changes made earlier in the year in the U.K., which resulted in accelerated momentum for\nthe business in the quarter:\n◦ In July, Depop removed selling fees for U.S. users and introduced a small buyer marketplace fee. We believe this change has\nmade Depop more attractive to sellers, driving a 26 percentage point acceleration in U.S. listings since launch, and offering\nbuyers a wider selection of secondhand fashion.\n◦ Depop ran its largest-ever U.S. marketing campaign, aimed at sharing the refreshed brand message and no selling fees\nproposition with more than 70 million people.\n• Depop also invested in making the listing experience easier through improving the effectiveness of its price guidance, pre-populating\nkey listing attributes using image recognition and generative AI technology, and streamlining the “Repop” process which allows buyers\nto easily relist items they have previously purchased on Depop.\nConsolidated Q4 24 Financial Guidance\nQ4 24 Guidance FY 24 Implied Guidance\nBased upon Q4 24 guidance, for the full year our\nWe currently anticipate that consolidated Q4 24\nconsolidated GMS will have declined roughly in the\nGMS GMS will decline in the low to mid single digit\nlow single digit percentage range compared to FY\npercentage range on a year-over-year basis.\n23.\nTake Rate 22.3% ~22%\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 28-29% 27.4-27.7%\nPlease note that our guidance assumes currency exchange rates remain unchanged at current levels.\nWith respect to our expectations under “Consolidated Q4 24 Financial Guidance” and outlook for the remainder of 2024 above, reconciliation of\nAdjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-\nlooking basis due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from Adjusted EBITDA; in particular,\nstock-based compensation expense, foreign exchange loss (gain), interest and other non-operating income, net, provision (benefit) for income\ntaxes, acquisition, divestiture, and corporate structure-related expenses, and other non-recurring expenses.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nEtsy will host a video webcast conference call to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, which will be live-streamed via our\nInvestor Relations website (investors.etsy.com) under the Events section. A copy of the earnings call presentation will also be posted to our\nwebsite.\nA replay of the video webcast will be available through the same link following the conference call starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time this\nevening, for at least three months thereafter.\nAbout Etsy\nEtsy, Inc. operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world.

Forward-looking statements include but are not\nlimited to: statements relating to our financial guidance for the fourth quarter 2024 and full year 2024 and underlying assumptions; our ability make Etsy\nForward-looking\nthe shopping destination for gifts this holiday season; our efforts to restart our growth engine by focusing on the things that differentiate us from other\nonline marketplaces; our efforts to position ourselves as the place you come early on for inspiration; the untapped potential of our app; exposure to the\nStatements\nbreadth of offerings on Etsy leading to increased consideration and visit frequency; consistently delightful buying experiences leading to more purchase\nfrequency; the ability of our investments in the app, search, and quality to create a superior experience; our ability to evolve our rewards program; the\nopportunity presented by physical gift cards; our long-term growth flywheel; our ability to drive profitability; our ability to build deeper loyalty and\nengagement; the impact of overall macro conditions and discrete events on our results; and the impact of domestic and global geopolitical uncertainties,\nincluding the U.S. general election, on consumer shopping trends.\nForward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terms such\nas “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “enable,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “outlook,” “plan,” “potential,” “target,” “will,” or similar\nexpressions and derivative forms and/or the negatives of those words.\nForward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expect. These\nrisks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: (1) the level of demand for our services or products sold in our marketplaces; (2) the importance to\nour success of the trustworthiness of our marketplaces and our ability to attract and retain active and engaged communities of buyers and sellers; (3) the\nfluctuation of our quarterly operating results; (4) our failure to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations; (5) any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in our operational metrics; (6) if we or our third-party providers are unable to protect against technology vulnerabilities, service interruptions,\nsecurity breaches, or other cyber-related events; (7) our dependence on continued and unimpeded access to third-party services, platforms, and\ninfrastructure; (8) macroeconomic events that are outside of our control; (9) operational and compliance risks related to our payments systems; (10) our\nability to recruit and retain employees; (11) our ability to compete effectively; (12) enforcement of our marketplace policies; (13) our ability to enhance our\ncurrent offerings and develop new offerings to respond to the changing needs of sellers and buyers; (14) risks related to our environmental, social, and\ngovernance activities and disclosures; (15) our efforts to expand our operations outside of the United States; (16) acquisitions that may prove unsuccessful\nor divert management attention; (17) failure to deal effectively with fraud; (18) compliance with evolving regulations, including in the area of privacy and\ndata protection; and (19) litigation and regulatory matters, including intellectual property claims. These and other risks and uncertainties are more fully\ndescribed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and subsequent reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, we operate in a very\ncompetitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we\nassess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, we cannot guarantee future\nresults, levels of activity, performance, achievements, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will occur. Forward-looking\nstatements represent our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date hereof. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nThis presentation is a high-level summary of our Q3 2024 financial results. For more information please refer to our press release dated October 30, 2024 and filings with the SEC. Please see the appendix\nfor a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this presentation to their respective most directly comparable financial measures, where available, calculated in accordance with\nGAAP.\nFor information about how we define active buyers, new buyers, reactivated buyers, repeat buyers and habitual buyers, see our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe delivered solid\nconsolidated\nrevenue and profit\ndespite a\nchallenging GMS\nquarter for the\nQ3 24 Consolidated GMS Q3 24 Consolidated Revenue Q3 24 Consolidated Adj.
