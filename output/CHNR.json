(NASDAQ: CHNR) (the “Company”) today announced its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the convenience of the reader, amounts in Chinese Yuan (“CNY”) have been translated into United States dollars (“US$”) at the rate of US$1.00 = CNY7.0786 as quoted by www.ofx.com on December 31, 2023, except as otherwise disclosed. \n\nMr. Wong Wah On Edward, Chairman of the Company, commented, “We are prudently investing in our exploration activities as we work to extract further value from the Wulatehouqi Moruogu Tong Mine. The disposition of Shanghai Onway Environmental Development Co., Limited in July 2023 can help the Company streamline its resources and invest in opportunities that will help the Company grow. We are pleased with the outcome of our due diligence investigation, and are focused on the next steps towards completion of the transaction. The direct placement of approximately US$3.27 million of common shares to certain institutional investors in February 2024 strengthens the capital base of the Company. We are evaluating to leverage our mining expertise and sales and distribution platforms, as we continue to execute on our long-term business strategy and build value for our shareholders.” \n\n**_Financial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023_**\n\nAdministrative expenses decreased by CNY12.37 million (US$1.75 million) from CNY25.25 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to CNY12.88 million (US$1.82 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was mainly caused by the one-off option awards granted on July 14, 2022 to certain eligible individuals covering an aggregate of 8,100,000 of the Company’s common shares under the 2014 Plan. \n\nOther income increased by CNY3.04 million (US$0.43 million) from CNY0.70 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to CNY3.74 million (US$0.53 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was mainly caused by government compensation received in 2023 for termination of 5 mine exploration rights in Dengkou County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n\nFair value gain on financial instruments, net decreased by CNY0.16 million (US$0.02 million) from CNY1.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to CNY0.85 million (US$0.12 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was caused by the fluctuation of fair values of the Company’s outstanding warrants. \n\nThe profit for the year from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased by CNY5.15 million (US$0.73 million) from CNY1.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a loss of CNY4.11 million (US$0.58 million) for the period ended July 31, 2023. The loss in 2023 was the result of an expected credit loss assessment of receivables and contract assets, due to the fact that the amount of uncollected and aged receivables and contract assets was relatively higher than the amount in 2022. \n\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net loss decreased by CNY9.86 million (US$1.39 million) from CNY22.30 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to CNY12.44 million (US$1.76 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n**About China Natural Resources:**\n\nChina Natural Resources, Inc.

(the “Company”) received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that, for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, the closing bid price for the Company’s common shares, without par value (the “Common Shares”), was below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Bid Price Requirement”).\n\nThe receipt of the deficiency letter has no immediate effect on the Company’s Nasdaq listing. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, the Company has been provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until January 2, 2025 (the “Compliance Date”), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. If the Company does not regain compliance during such 180-day period, the Company may be eligible for an extension of an additional 180 calendar days, provided that the Company meets the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq except for the Bid Price Requirement, and provide a written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Company does not qualify for the second compliance period or fails to regain compliance during the second 180-day period, then Nasdaq will notify the Company of its determination to delist the Company’s Common Shares, at which point the Company will have an opportunity to appeal the delisting determination to a Hearings Panel. If, at any time before the Compliance Date, the closing bid price for the Common Shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Staff will provide the Company written confirmation of compliance with the Bid Price Requirement.\n\nThe Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of the Common Shares and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company issued a press release discussing the receipt of the deficiency letter, which is filed as Exhibit 15.1 to this Form 6-K.\n\n**_EXHIBIT INDEX_**\n\n**Exhibit Number** | **Description**  \n---|---  \n15.1 | [Press release dated July 11, 2024](ex15x1.htm)  \n  \n**SIGNATURES**\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\n**CHINA NATURAL RESOURCES, INC.**  \n---  \nDate: July 12, 2024 | By: |  /s/ Wong Wah On Edward  \nWong Wah On Edward  \n_Chairman and Chief Executive Officer_\n"
