Your investment in the Fund(s) is not a deposit in a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. The risks associated with an investment in the Fund(s) can increase during times of significant market volatility. The Fund(s) also has specific principal risks, which are described below. More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.\n\n**Investing involves risks. Loss of principal is possible.** The Fund(s) face numerous market trading risks, including absence of an active market risk, authorized participation concentration risk, cap change risk, capped upside risk, cash holdings risk, costs of buying and selling fund shares, counterparty risk, derivatives risk, equity securities risk, flex options risk, flex options valuation risk, index or model constituent risk, information technology companies risk, large-capitalization investing risk, management risk, market fluctuation tax risk, market risk, new fund risk, non-diversification risk, options risk, premium-discount risk, sector risk, significant exposure risk, SPY equity risk, SPY risk, target outcome period risk, tax risk from investment in other investment companies, trading issues risk, underlying ETF concentration risk, underlying ETF exposure risk, and underlying ETF risk. For a detailed list of fund risks see the prospectus.\n\n**There are no assurances the Fund(s) will be successful in providing the sought-after protection. The outcomes that the Fund(s) seeks to provide may only be realized if you are holding shares on the first day of the outcome period and continue to hold them on the last day of the outcome period, approximately one year. There is no guarantee that the outcomes for an outcome period will be realized or that the Fund(s) will achieve its investment objective. If the outcome period has begun and the underlying ETF has increased in value, any appreciation of the Fund(s) by virtue of increases in the underlying ETF since the commencement of the outcome period will not be protected by the sought-after protection, and an investor could experience losses until the underlying ETF returns to the original price at the commencement of the outcome period. Fund shareholders are subject to an upside return cap (the \"Cap\") that represents the maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the fund(s) for the outcome period, before fees and expenses. If the outcome period has begun and the Fund(s) have increased in value to a level near to the Cap, an investor purchasing at that price has little or no ability to achieve gains but remains vulnerable to downside risks. Additionally, the Cap may rise or fall from one outcome period to the next. The Cap, and the Fund(s) position relative to it, should be considered before investing in the Fund(s). The Fund(s) website,**[**www.calamos.com**](/)**, provides important Fund information as well information relating to the potential outcomes of an investment in the Fund(s) on a daily basis.**\n\nThe Fund(s) are designed to provide point-to-point exposure to the price return of the reference asset via a basket of Flex Options. As a result, the ETFs are not expected to move directly in line with the reference asset during the interim period. Investors purchasing shares after an outcome period has begun may experience very different results than fund's investment objective. Initial outcome periods are approximately 1-year beginning on the fund's inception date. Following the initial outcome period, each subsequent outcome period will begin on the first day of the month the fund was incepted. After the conclusion of an outcome period, another will begin.\n\n**FLEX Options Risk** **–** The Fund(s) will utilize FLEX Options issued and guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Fund(s) could suffer significant losses. Additionally, FLEX Options may be less liquid than standard options. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the Fund(s) may have difficulty closing out certain FLEX Options positions at desired times and prices. The values of FLEX Options do not increase or decrease at the same rate as the reference asset and may vary due to factors other than the price of reference asset. Shares are bought and sold at market price, not net asset value (NAV), and are not individually redeemable from the fund. NAV represents the value of each share's portion of the fund's underlying assets and cash at the end of the trading day. Market price returns reflect the midpoint of the bid/ask spread as of the close of trading on the exchange where fund shares are listed.\n\n100% capital protection is over a one-year period before fees and expenses. All caps are pre-determined.\n\n**Cap Rate –** Maximum percentage return an investor can achieve from an investment in the Fund if held over the Outcome Period.\n\n**Cap Range –** Cap ranges are based on the last 15 trading days prior to range announcement, based on market conditions during the sample period, and are subject to change. The actual cap rate may be different based on market events.\n\n**Protection Level –** Amount of protection the Fund is designed to achieve over the Days Remaining.\n\n**Outcome Period –** Number of days in the Outcome Period.\n\nNasdaq® and Nasdaq-100 are registered trademarks of Nasdaq, Inc.

          "content": "OCTOBER 2024\n3 Reflections on Private Credit\nImagine an asset class that’s designed to boost returns, reduce risk and open doors to opportunities beyond traditional markets.\nThis is the influence of private credit – a strategy once exclusive to institutional investors is now accessible to everyone including\nretail investors. With its growing popularity and accessibility, the asset class reached nearly $2 trillion at the end of 2023, roughly\nten times larger than it was in 20091.\nAs we look toward the future, we are eager to share three pivotal takeaways on the opportunities in private credit and the\npotential for investors willing to explore the asset class.\n1). Investing across the spectrum is advantageous for diversification\nPrivate credit’s rapid expansion into a broadly diversified asset class should not be underestimated. From litigation finance to\ninfrastructure lending and healthcare royalties, private credit has evolved into a market that extends well beyond traditional\ndirect lending.\nOur stance on the private credit landscape emphasizes the importance of broad sector diversification rather than concentrating\nexposure and risk on a specific area of the market. The Calamos Aksia Alternative Credit and Income Fund (CAPIX) accesses\nspecialized lending across six distinct sectors.\nIn dark blue, we highlight direct lending as a core position within a portfolio, however, it is only one segment of an expanding\nprivate credit market. Everything to the right of that, in light blue, we view as complementary sectors relative to direct lending from\na spread, collateral, and diversification perspective. Altogether, we aim to balance exposures across these areas to build a more\nrobust, “all-weather” portfolio that is not tied to any one risk factor.\nFIGURE 1: PRIVATE CREDIT MAP\nDistressed\nDirect Debt and Specialty Real Estate Real Assets\nMezzanine\nLending Special Finance Credit Credit\nSituations\nUS direct lending “Credit Consumer and SME US corporate real Infrastructure lending US mezzanine\nopportunities” lending estate (CRE lending:\nEuropean direct Energy credit European mezzanine\nlending Corporate distressed Rediscount lending core transitional,\nbridge lending) Trade finance Structured equity\nEmerging markets Opportunistic Factoring and\ndirect lending structured credit receivables European CRE Metals and mining PIK Holdco\nlending finance\nRegulatory capital\nReal estate distressed\nrelief Emerging markets Agricultural credit\nSome private NPLs Royalties* CRE lending Transportation\ncredit registered Capital solutions/ Venture lending CRE structured credit\nfunds may have rescue finance\nTechnology lending Residential\na narrow focus “Special situations” mortgages\non US direct loans Financial services credit\nlending.

Supply/demand dynamics are shifting\nWhile 2023 marked the “golden age” for direct lending, the supply/demand imbalance that made it a compelling market\nenvironment, driven by constrained capital markets activity, has reversed (see below). Increased activity from the broadly\nsyndicated loan (BSL) market has led to a sharp retrench where loans are pricing significantly tighter than they were last year.\nUltimately, increased competition has impacted the value proposition within direct lending, highlighting the potential benefits\nof CAPIX flexibility and our ability to diversify risk across various private credit sectors.\nFIGURE 2: BROADLY SYNDICATED LOANS (BSL) AND DIRECT LENDING TAKEOUTS ($B)\nDirect Lending Refinanced by BSL BSL Refinanced by Direct Lending\n$12B\n$12B\n$10B\n$10B $9B\n$8B\n$7B\n$6B $5B\n$4B\n$3B\n$2B\n$1B $1B $1B\n$0B $0B $0B\n$0B\n11QQ 22002233 2Q 2023 3Q 2023 4Q 2023 1Q 2024 2Q 2024\nSource: Pitchbook/LCD.\nOutside direct lending, many sectors are offering lender-friendly dynamics which can include attractive pricing and enhanced\nportfolio diversification benefits. As a result, the Fund has continued to source attractive investment opportunities in other\nareas of the market. We highlight asset-backed opportunities in the wake of new banking regulations, such as unique\nareas within specialty finance (e.g., regulatory capital relief deals, structured secondaries and NAV loans), real asset lending\n(e.g., infrastructure and transportation assets), and capital solutions - where bespoke financing can help high quality but\noverleveraged businesses pay down burdensome senior debt or make accretive add-on acquisitions.\n3). Not all private credit funds are created equal\nWith its broad focus, the goal of CAPIX is to take advantage of income opportunities across the full private credit universe,\nallowing our portfolio management team to skillfully allocate to where we believe the best risk/return opportunities lie. To do\nso effectively, the Fund operates with open architecture, enabling loans to be sourced from high conviction private markets\noriginators, each specializing within a specific segment of the asset class.\nAksia’s expansive platform and broad network with managers allows the Fund to generate significant deal flow, in our\nopinion. The broad sourcing network enables CAPIX to be highly selective and adapt to changing market environments.\nAksia’s network of highly skilled managers are those that meet the highest institutional standards, who have deep\nrelationships with private equity sponsors and have established teams. By sourcing loans with high conviction managers, Aksia\ncan build a private credit portfolio of highly diversified loans across sector and industry that seeks to maximize return and\nreduce risk in client allocations.\nOur Approach\nThe breadth of private credit today can offer investors a wide range of sectors with different returns, drivers and collateral\ntypes. Rather than constructing a portfolio with concentrated risk in one sector of private credit, the CAPIX team leverages\nthe full opportunity set to build an optimized “one-stop-shop” private credit solution. We believe a well-structured, diversified\nallocation to private credit can provide enhanced income while increasing the overall stability of an investor’s total portfolio.\nThe Fund’s fundraising success thus far is a testament to that thesis. We want to thank our investors for their confidence and\nsupport over the past 16 months and look forward to what lies ahead of us.\nBefore investing carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and High Yield, Low-Rated or Unrated Securities.

interest, short interest, short dividend expenses, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extra-ordinary expenses, if any) of Class A, Class C, and Class I are limited to 1.40%, 2.15%, and 1.15% of average net assets, respectively. The Fund's investment adviser has contractually agreed to limit the Fund's annual ordinary operating expenses through March 1, 2025 for Class R6 shares (as a percentage of average net assets) to 1.15% less the annual sub- transfer agency ratio for the Fund. The annual sub-transfer agency ratio is equal to the aggregate sub-transfer agency expenses common to the other share classes of the Fund divided by the aggregate average annual net assets of the Fund's other share classes. For purposes of these expense limitations, operating expenses do not include taxes, interest, short interest, short dividend expenses, brokerage commissions, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses, if any. Calamos Advisors LLC (\"Calamos Advisors\") may recapture previously waived expense amounts within the same fiscal year for any day where the respective Fund's expense ratio falls below the contractual expense limit up to the expense limit for that day.
