Huntsman, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented:\n\n_\"The third quarter was consistent with our outlook of a stable environment at trough conditions in our core construction and industrial markets. Total volumes for the Company did improve 5% in the quarter versus the prior year with stable margins sequentially. Construction and transportation account for approximately three quarters of our volumes and we expect near term trough conditions to persist through a seasonally lower fourth quarter. For the medium to long-term, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and ECB, combined with government stimulus in China, should have a positive impact across our global portfolio, primarily in construction. In the meantime, we are focused on what we control - improving our cost position and our balance sheet strength to maintain optionality to invest in our core businesses in a disciplined manner. We were pleased by the success of our strong bond offering in the third quarter which points to the long-term strength of our portfolio and anticipation of market improvements in the coming years.\"_\n\n**Segment Analysis for 3Q24 Compared to 3Q23**\n\n_Polyurethanes_\n\nThe increase in revenues in our Polyurethanes segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower MDI average selling prices. Sales volumes increased primarily due to improved demand and share gains in certain markets. MDI average selling prices decreased primarily due to less favorable supply and demand dynamics. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower MDI average selling prices and lower equity earnings from our minority-owned joint venture in China, partially offset by lower fixed costs and higher sales volumes.\n\n_Performance Products_\n\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Products segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower average selling prices. Sales volumes increased primarily due to improved demand in fuels and lubes and coatings and adhesives markets. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to competitive pressure. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower average selling prices and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower fixed costs.\n\n_Advanced Materials_\n\nThe decrease in revenues in our Advanced Materials segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to unfavorable sales mix. Sales volumes increased in our aerospace and coatings markets driven by market recovery, partially offset by lower demand in our industrial market. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher fixed costs.\n\n_Corporate, LIFO and other_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other was a loss of $34 million as compared to a loss of $41 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other resulted primarily from decreases in corporate overhead costs and unallocated foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by an increase in LIFO valuation losses.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, our free cash flow from continuing operations was $93 million as compared to $117 million in the same period of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $1.7 billion of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we spent $41 million on capital expenditures from continuing operations as compared to $50 million in the same period of 2023. During 2024, we expect to spend between approximately $180 million to $190 million on capital expenditures.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was 115% and our adjusted effective tax rate was 41%. We expect our 2024 adjusted effective tax rate to be between approximately 30% to 34%. We expect our long-term adjusted effective tax rate to be between approximately 22% to 24%.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call Information**\n\nWe will hold a conference call to discuss our third quarter 2024 financial results on Tuesday, November 5, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET.\n\nWebcast link: <https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=52266EEY>\n\nParticipant dial-in numbers:Domestic callers: (877) 402-8037International callers: (201) 378-4913\n\nThe conference call will be accompanied by presentation slides that will be accessible via the webcast link and Huntsman's investor relations website, [www.huntsman.com/investors](http://www.huntsman.com/investors).

We provide adjusted net income (loss) because we feel it provides meaningful insight for the investment community into the performance of our business. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss). Additional information with respect to our use of each of these financial measures follows:  \nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share, as used herein, are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  \nAdjusted EBITDA is computed by eliminating the following from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (b) interest expense, net; (c) income taxes; (d) depreciation and amortization; (e) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (f) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain other items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA in Table 4 above.   \nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share are computed by eliminating the after tax impact of the following items from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (b) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (c) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain other items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) in Table 4 above. The income tax impacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and the total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach.  \nWe may disclose forward-looking adjusted EBITDA because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, net, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted EBITDA represents the forecast net income on our underlying business operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our adjusted EBITDA to differ.  \n(2) |  Management internally uses free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate our liquidity, (b) evaluate strategic investments, (c) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (d) evaluate our ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.  \n(3) |  During the first quarter 2023, we completed the divestiture of our Textile Effects business, which is reported as discontinued operations on the income and cash flow statements.  \n(4) |  We believe the adjusted effective tax rate provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses' operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. In our view, effective tax rate is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted effective tax rate. The reconciliation of historical adjusted effective tax rate and effective tax rate is set forth in Table 4 above. Please see the reconciliation of our net income to adjusted net income in Table 4 for details regarding the tax impacts of our non-GAAP adjustments.  \nOur forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate is calculated based on our forecast effective tax rate, and the range of our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate equals the range of our forecast effective tax rate. We disclose forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate represents the forecast effective tax rate on our underlying business operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our effective tax rate to differ.  \n(5) |  Net debt is a measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account our total cash. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total debt, including the current portion, and subtracting total cash.  \n(6) |  Certain legal and other settlements and related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately $10 million related to the settlement of a claim in connection with a commercial dispute.  \n  \n**About Huntsman:**_Huntsman Corporation is a publicly traded global manufacturer and marketer of differentiated and specialty chemicals with 2023 revenues of approximately $6 billion from our continuing operations.

Huntsman, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented:\n\"The third quarter was consistent with our outlook of a stable environment at trough conditions in our core\nconstruction and industrial markets. Total volumes for the Company did improve 5% in the quarter versus the\nprior year with stable margins sequentially. Construction and transportation account for approximately three\nquarters of our volumes and we expect near term trough conditions to persist through a seasonally lower fourth\nquarter. For the medium to long-term, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and ECB, combined with\ngovernment stimulus in China, should have a positive impact across our global portfolio, primarily in\nconstruction. In the meantime, we are focused on what we control - improving our cost position and our\nbalance sheet strength to maintain optionality to invest in our core businesses in a disciplined manner. We\nwere pleased by the success of our strong bond offering in the third quarter which points to the long-term\nstrength of our portfolio and anticipation of market improvements in the coming years.\"\nSegment Analysis for 3Q24 Compared to 3Q23\nPolyurethanes\nThe increase in revenues in our Polyurethanes segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower MDI\naverage selling prices. Sales volumes increased primarily due to improved demand and share gains in certain\nmarkets. MDI average selling prices decreased primarily due to less favorable supply and demand dynamics.\nThe decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower MDI average selling prices and lower\nequity earnings from our minority-owned joint venture in China, partially offset by lower fixed costs and higher\nsales volumes.\nPerformance Products\nThe increase in revenues in our Performance Products segment for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by lower\naverage selling prices. Sales volumes increased primarily due to improved demand in fuels and lubes and\ncoatings and adhesives markets. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to competitive pressure. The\ndecrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower average selling prices and unfavorable sales\nmix, partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower fixed costs.\nAdvanced Materials\nThe decrease in revenues in our Advanced Materials segment for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 compared to the same period of 2023 was primarily due to lower average selling prices, partially offset by\nhigher sales volumes. Average selling prices decreased primarily due to unfavorable sales mix. Sales volumes\nincreased in our aerospace and coatings markets driven by market recovery, partially offset by lower demand\nin our industrial market. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher fixed costs.\nCorporate, LIFO and other\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, adjusted EBITDA from Corporate and other was a loss of\n$34 million as compared to a loss of $41 million for the same period of 2023. The increase in adjusted EBITDA\nfrom Corporate and other resulted primarily from decreases in corporate overhead costs and unallocated\nforeign currency exchange losses, partially offset by an increase in LIFO valuation losses.\n- 2 -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, our free cash flow from continuing operations was $93\nmillion as compared to $117 million in the same period of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had\napproximately $1.7 billion of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we spent $41 million on capital expenditures from\ncontinuing operations as compared to $50 million in the same period of 2023. During 2024, we expect to\nspend between approximately $180 million to $190 million on capital expenditures.\nIncome Taxes\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our effective tax rate was 115% and our adjusted effective tax rate was 41%. We\nexpect our 2024 adjusted effective tax rate to be between approximately 30% to 34%. We expect our long-term\nadjusted effective tax rate to be between approximately 22% to 24%.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nWe will hold a conference call to discuss our third quarter 2024 financial results on Tuesday, November 5,\n2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET.\nWebcast link: https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=52266EEY\nParticipant dial-in numbers:\nDomestic callers: (877) 402-8037\nInternational callers: (201) 378-4913\nThe conference call will be accompanied by presentation slides that will be accessible via the webcast link and\nHuntsman’s investor relations website, www.huntsman.com/investors.

We provide adjusted net income (loss) because we feel it provides meaningful insight for the\ninvestment community into the performance of our business. We believe that net income (loss) is the performance measure\ncalculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”) that is most directly\ncomparable to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss). Additional information with respect to our use of each of these\nfinancial measures follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share, as used herein, are not necessarily\ncomparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is computed by eliminating the following from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests; (b) interest expense, net; (c) income taxes; (d) depreciation and amortization; (e) amortization of pension and\npostretirement actuarial losses; (f) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain\nother items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted EBITDA in Table 4 above.\nAdjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share are computed by eliminating the after tax impact of the\nfollowing items from net income (loss): (a) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests; (b) amortization of pension and\npostretirement actuarial losses; (c) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and further adjusted for certain\nother items set forth in the reconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted net income (loss) in Table 4 above. The income tax\nimpacts, if any, of each adjusting item represent a ratable allocation of the total difference between the unadjusted tax expense and\nthe total adjusted tax expense, computed without consideration of any adjusting items using a with and without approach.\nWe may disclose forward-looking adjusted EBITDA because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or\nmay not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory\nadjustments, net, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only\nitems, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot\nbe reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted EBITDA represents the forecast net income on our underlying\nbusiness operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our\nadjusted EBITDA to differ.\n(2) Management internally uses free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate our liquidity, (b) evaluate strategic investments, (c) plan stock\nbuyback and dividend levels and (d) evaluate our ability to incur and service debt. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided\nby operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a defined term under U.S. GAAP, and it should not be\ninferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.\n(3) During the first quarter 2023, we completed the divestiture of our Textile Effects business, which is reported as discontinued\noperations on the income and cash flow statements.\n(4) We believe the adjusted effective tax rate provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items\nthat management believes are not indicative of the businesses’ operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business\nresults and trends. In our view, effective tax rate is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted effective tax rate. The reconciliation of historical adjusted effective tax rate and\neffective tax rate is set forth in Table 4 above. Please see the reconciliation of our net income to adjusted net income in Table 4 for\ndetails regarding the tax impacts of our non-GAAP adjustments.\nOur forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate is calculated based on our forecast effective tax rate, and the range of our forward-\nlooking adjusted effective tax rate equals the range of our forecast effective tax rate. We disclose forward-looking adjusted effective\ntax rate because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as\nbusiness acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements\nand related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted.\nEach of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our\nforward-looking adjusted effective tax rate represents the forecast effective tax rate on our underlying business operations but does\nnot reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our effective tax rate to differ.\n(5) Net debt is a measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account our total cash. We use it as an indicator\nof our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total debt, including the current portion, and subtracting total cash.\n(6) Certain legal and other settlements and related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes\napproximately $10 million related to the settlement of a claim in connection with a commercial dispute.\n- 9 -\nAbout Huntsman:\nHuntsman Corporation is a publicly traded global manufacturer and marketer of differentiated and specialty chemicals with 2023 revenues\nof approximately $6 billion from our continuing operations.

          "content": "Huntsman Corporation (NYSE – HUN)\nThird Quarter 2024 Prepared Comments\nNovember 4, 2024\nOn November 5, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. ET, Peter Huntsman, Chairman, President and CEO, and Phil\nLister, Executive Vice President and CFO, will host a public question-and-answer session with analysts\naccessible on our website or by telephone as detailed in our third quarter 2024 financial results news\nrelease. These are their prepared remarks to accompany our results. They should be read together with\nthe third quarter 2024 financial results news release and the slides detailing our third quarter 2024\nfinancial results, both of which were publicly issued and posted on our website\n(www.huntsman.com/investors) after the close of NYSE trading on November 4, 2024.\nThis document, the accompanying slides, and the call/webcast include certain forward-looking\nstatements about our projections or expectations for the future. All such statements are forward-\nlooking statements and, while they reflect our current expectations, they involve risks and uncertainties,\nand are not guarantees of future performance. You should review our filings with the SEC for more\ninformation regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections\nor expectations. We do not plan on publicly updating or revising any forward-looking statements during\nthe quarter.\nWe also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net\nincome or loss and free cash flow. You can find reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measures in our earnings release which has been posted to our website at\nwww.huntsman.com/investors.\nSlide 4: Overview\nHuntsman reported third quarter 2024 revenues of $1.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $131\nmillion. Third quarter net loss attributable to Huntsman was $33 million and operating cash flow from\ncontinuing operations was $134 million.\nSlide 5: Polyurethanes\nAdjusted EBITDA for our Polyurethanes division in the third quarter was $76 million. Our sales\nvolumes improved by 5% year-over-year, despite outages in the quarter impacting growth by 2%.\nThrough the first nine months of 2024, volumes have increased 8% compared to the prior year. Despite\nthe lack of meaningful pricing improvement associated with this increased volume, the level of growth\nthat we and others in the industry are seeing off a low base is important heading into 2025, as demand\n1\nmay benefit further from the potential impact of interest rate cuts in the United States and Europe as\nwell as stimulus in China.\nAdjusted EBITDA declined versus the prior year on the back of lower pricing and significantly\nlower equity earnings from our commodity PO/MTBE joint venture in China, partially offset by higher\nsales volumes and lower fixed costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter of 8% was similar to\nboth the prior quarter and prior year. While we view this stability in profitability positively relative to the\ndeclines which began in the second half of 2022, we consider margins to be below mid-cycle average\nwith significant upside anticipated once the industry cycle improves.\nOur European volumes decreased by mid-single digits year-over-year as positive demand trends\nin composite wood products, elastomers, adhesives and coatings was more than offset by lower\ninsulation demand. The volumes were also impacted by a MDI force majeure event at the beginning of\nthe quarter caused by a third party outage and an unplanned outage in Rotterdam at the end of the\nquarter. The Adjusted EBITDA impact from the unplanned outages amounted to approximately $10\nmillion for the quarter. Margins in Europe were impacted by competitive pressure from both domestic\nproducers and imports into the region. Natural gas related costs in the region have been trending higher\ntowards $13 per mmbtu, more than 6 times the current cost in the United States, and offsetting some of\nthe benefit from lower benzene costs. We remain focused on improving the profitability in this region.\nTo mitigate the impact of European energy policies and regulatory environment that are unfavorable to\nindustrial companies, we continually look to reduce costs to remain competitive in the region. We\nrecently completed a European restructuring program, and we expect to deliver additional cost savings\nduring 2025.\nYear-over-year volumes in Asia were down low single digits versus the prior period with higher\nsales into automotive, adhesives, and furniture offset by lower volumes in other markets. Despite a\nmixed demand environment in China, average MDI prices were stable to higher in the region. We are\nnot yet seeing the impact from the Chinese stimulus announcements and our near-term expectations\nare for relative margin and volume stability continuing through the fourth quarter. Our PO/MTBE joint\nventure contributed $5 million during the third quarter. This was significantly below expectations due to\nlower than anticipated MTBE margins. Given current trends, we expect lower MTBE margins in the\nfourth quarter compared to the third quarter which will mean equity income below our third quarter\nresult.\nNorth America saw the strongest volume growth of the three regions in the third quarter.\nRegional sales volumes increased due to favorable comparisons resulting from the aggressive destocking\n2\nwe saw through much of 2023. Volumes increased 18% year-over-year due to a modest improvement in\nunderlying demand, the absence of destocking, and some business wins. Pricing was relatively stable to\nslightly higher in the region compared to the second quarter, and margins improved versus the prior\nyear period on lower costs and better utilization. As a reminder, a significant portion of MDI North\nAmerican sales are sold under contracts containing price escalators to adjust for movement in key raw\nmaterials and we currently sell only a small portion of our portfolio into the monthly spot market. Two-\nthirds of our Polyurethanes Americas portfolio is linked to construction, approximately 40% of which is\ncurrently commercial and 60% is residential and approximately 75% of our residential exposure is\ndirectly related to new construction. As a result, the Americas has been our most sensitive region to\nconstruction activity when compared to our other regions globally. We would expect demand and\nmargin strength to improve from current levels as construction activity is helped by lower interest rates\nspurring construction activity as we move through 2025.\nOur global automotive business, which represents approximately 15% of the Polyurethanes\nportfolio by volume, grew slightly year-over-year in the third quarter. Strength in our China automotive\nbusiness, including electric vehicles, was offset by weakness in our Americas business with relatively\nstable volumes in Europe. Similar to reported global automotive production rates, our automotive\nbusiness did slow quarter over quarter more than we had anticipated. We expect automotive\nproduction globally to remain challenged in the fourth quarter. Our global elastomers platform\nrepresents approximately 10% of our Polyurethanes portfolio and we expect to continue to deliver solid\nprofitability that is well above the business segment average while also seeing some modest volume\nimprovement versus the prior year.\nAs the global construction and industrial markets recover, we expect our Polyurethanes business\nto return to average cycle profitability, well above our current returns. Further, the cost savings we\nachieved over the past two years are reflected in structural changes, which we expect will enhance our\noperational leverage as volumes return to a more normalized environment.\nFourth quarter demand is typically a lower volume quarter due to seasonality when compared\nto the second and third quarters. When compared to prior year results, we expect volume and margin\nimprovement in the Americas and China regions to offset lower equity earnings and continued\nheadwinds in Europe. We expect Polyurethanes adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter to be in the\nrange of $45 million to $60 million.\n3\nSlide 6: Performance Products\nOur Performance Products division reported adjusted EBITDA of $42 million for the third\nquarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%, was slightly below the prior year and stable compared to\nthe second quarter. Total sales volumes increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes in\nmaleic anhydride and ethyleneamines. The positive impact to adjusted EBITDA from the higher volume\nwas offset by lower average margins, primarily due to increased competitive pressure.\nFrom a market perspective, sales volume increased in construction, fuel & lubes, and coatings &\nadhesives due to modest underlying demand improvement and the absence of destocking in the\nrespective channels, which more than offset weakness in industrial-related markets.\nAs we have stated over the past year, our focus in Performance Products remains on improving\nsales across our strategic markets in order to position this business more favorably once markets begin\nto show consistent improvement in underlying demand. Variable unit margins remained stable in the\nquarter, remaining well above pre-pandemic levels and, together with our fixed cost discipline, will allow\nfor solid operational leverage with an upturn in the business cycle.\nCapital investments in our performance amines product lines serving the semiconductor\npolyurethane catalyst markets are steadily advancing towards completion, commissioning, and\ncommercialization over the next year. Once fully operational, these investments are expected to\nstrengthen Performance Products and support the division with sustained growth in the future.\nWe expect the fourth quarter to be seasonally weaker than the third quarter with no\nimprovements in economic activity, leading to guidance for Performance Products adjusted EBITDA in\nthe range of $20 million to $30 million.\nSlide 7: Advanced Materials\nOur Advanced Materials division reported adjusted EBITDA of $47 million in the quarter.\nOverall sales volumes increased 5% year-over-year, as volume improved across most of the division’s\ncore markets, including the power, coatings and aerospace markets. Sales volumes in our automotive\nand general industrial markets were below our projections, which drove results slightly below our\nguidance range. Nevertheless, improved volumes and stable variable margins allowed strong adjusted\nEBITDA margins of 18%.\nAerospace revenue grew 8% year-on-year and the growth in this segment has been solid year to\ndate up 7%. While commercial related composite sales can move from one quarter to the next due to\nsupply chain challenges faced by the OEMs, our aerospace interior adhesives applications business has\ncontinued to experience solid growth. Demand for our composite related products is tied predominantly\n4\nto wide body production rates, which has a positive outlook over the next several years. In the near-\nterm, we expect to see further supply chain disruptions, including an impact from the Boeing strike in\nthe fourth quarter. In addition, compared to the prior year, we expect to see lower defense-related\nsales which were exceptionally high this time last year, and benefited the fourth quarter of 2023 by\napproximately $5 million.\nSlowing industrial activity across all the regions had a negative impact on our general industrial\nand automotive businesses within Advanced Materials, which was partially offset by our aerospace and\ninfrastructure related businesses. We expect demand trends in our industrial business to remain a\nheadwind in the fourth quarter which is typically the seasonally softest quarter. Pricing and variable\nmargins have been stable across our end markets and we expect this to continue for the remainder of\nthe year.\nWhile we will be disciplined as we continue to explore all further growth opportunities,\nAdvanced Materials remains our primary focus for bolt-on acquisitions to expand the overall portfolio,\ndrive sales growth, and improve the overall returns of the business. We will also continue with capital\nlite organic projects, R&D investments, including our MIRALON® technology and we will drive\nimprovements in site productivity. We remain very positive about the long-term prospects for the\nAdvanced Materials division over the coming years.\nFor the fourth quarter we expect Advanced Materials adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $35\nmillion to $40 million.\nSlide 8: Year-over-Year & Quarter-over-Quarter\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $131 million compared to $131 million in the second\nquarter of 2024 and $136 million in the third quarter of 2023. Revenues increased 2% compared to the\nprior year and declined 2% compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 9%.\nVolumes improved 5% year-on-year with consistent growth across each of our business\nsegments. Excluding outages at our Rotterdam MDI facility in the third quarter, volume growth would\nhave been 7% year-on-year. Sequentially, volumes declined seasonally by approximately 3%.\nApproximately 60% of our volumes in the third quarter went into construction, as residential,\ncommercial or infrastructure-related sales, with approximately 40% of those volumes into North\nAmerica. Year-on-year volumes were up 14% in North America, down 4% in Europe and flat in Asia.\nSequentially, volumes were down approximately 3%, with relatively consistent declines across all\nregions. Automotive volumes, which represent approximately 15% of our portfolio, increased 3% year-\n5\non-year and declined 6% sequentially with small gains in China offset by lower sequential growth in\nEurope and North America.\nIn local currency, price/mix declined year-on-year in Polyurethanes by 1%, Performance\nProducts was down 3% and Advanced Materials was down 7%. Sequentially, price/mix was relatively flat\nfor all divisions and unit margins were also flat compared to the second quarter with an improvement in\nraw materials offset by negative mix. Adjusted EBITDA benefited by approximately $10 million from a\nbuild in inventory in the third quarter ahead of a MDI turnaround at our Rotterdam facility in the fourth\nquarter. This build and subsequent drop in inventory during the final quarter of the year will lead to an\napproximately $20 million movement sequentially between the third and fourth quarters. Equity income\nfrom our Chinese PO/MTBE joint venture was considerably lower year-on-year by $25 million due to\nweak MTBE margins.\nTotal SG&A costs were 7% below last year’s level and lower sequentially by 13%. Lower non-\ncash incentive compensation expense drove the decline in SG&A, with cost savings offsetting inflation.\nOn a 9-months basis, SG&A is 3% or $15 million below 2023 with half of the decline due to a lower\nincentive compensation accrual in 2024.\nOur Polyurethanes Adjusted EBITDA margins are currently below 10% and as we move towards\n2025, we will initiate additional restructuring actions within the segment in order to improve cost\ncompetitiveness. We expect to achieve $40 million to $50 million of Adjusted EBITDA improvements\nexcluding inflation over the course of 2025 and 2026. Related cash spend is targeted at approximately\n$50 million over the next 24 months, of which approximately $30 million is expected to occur in 2025.\nThe impact on adjusted EBITDA across the company from foreign exchange was negligible in the\nquarter both sequentially and year-on-year, with the Euro and Chinese Yuan relatively stable across\nperiods compared to the US Dollar. During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete liquidation of our\nlegal entity in Argentina, which we exited last year as part of our cost saving program. The liquidation\nwill result in a non-cash cumulative translation adjustment of approximately $30 million to GAAP net\nincome in the fourth quarter.\nCorporate expense declined year-on-year and sequentially due to a lower accrual for non-cash\nincentive compensation and overall cost control offsetting inflation.\nOur adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 41%. On a year-to-date basis our adjusted\neffective tax rate is 35%. Our full year guidance range remains 30% to 34% with some risk around that\nrange due to the low level of pre-tax income in 2024, amplifying percentage rate movements. Our long\nterm adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 24%.\n6\nSlide 9: Cash Flow and Liquidity Considerations\nCash flow from operations for the third quarter was an inflow of $134 million compared to an\ninflow of $167 million in the prior year period. Primary working capital was a cash outflow in the quarter\nof $9 million, driven primarily by sequentially higher inventory related to the planned build of inventory\nahead of planned MDI turnarounds in the fourth quarter. We will continue to control our inventory\nlevels, which will decline during the fourth quarter.\nCapital expenditures were $41 million for the third quarter, as we continued various process\nsafety and reliability projects and progressed growth projects in our Advanced Materials and\nPerformance Products divisions. We have spent $133 million in the first nine months of the year. We\nhave narrowed our guidance for our full year capital expenditure to a range of $180 million to $190\nmillion. Free cash flow for the quarter was positive with an inflow of $93 million. Within the quarter we\ndid benefit from a one-time dividend of $34 million as we continue to progress the liquidation of our\nformer Chinese crude MDI joint venture, which we expect to complete during 2025.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share was 10 cents per share for the quarter. Our quarterly\ndividend is currently 25 cents per share, an annual payout of $1.00 per share and our dividend yield is\ncurrently approximately 4.5%. We did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter and do not\nanticipate repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter. Our focus remains on improving our cash delivery\nyear-on-year and we will evaluate any share repurchases on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\nDuring the quarter, we successfully placed $350 million of senior notes due in 2034 with a 5.70%\ncoupon rate. The bond issuance was 8 times oversubscribed at the peak of the order book reflecting, in\nour view, the positive long-term outlook for our portfolio and our disciplined approach to allocation of\ncapital. We used the proceeds to reduce borrowing on our revolver and securitization program to zero\nat the end of the third quarter. We subsequently entered into a cross-currency US dollar to Euro swap\ndue in the fourth quarter of 2027, for the full $350 million. We will pay Euro interest of 4.25% for the\nnext 3 years, effectively lowering the US dollar interest amount payable. We have a 10-year Euro 300\nmillion note maturing in April 2025 with a coupon rate of 4.25% which we intend to pay off in the\nordinary course. We will then have bond maturities in 2029, 2031 and our newest issuance in 2034. As a\nresult, our balance sheet remains strong and, while our net debt leverage ratio is relatively high due to\nour last 12 months adjusted EBITDA, we expect that ratio to decline by year end. We closed the quarter\nwith $1.7 billion in available liquidity.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks regarding the third quarter 2024 results and our current\noutlook. We look forward to updating the market when we report our fourth quarter 2024 results.\n7\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and\nSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
