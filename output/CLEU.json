Despite these challenges, we successfully maintained a relatively stable revenue stream from our core tailored job readiness training services, which remains the backbone of our income. We are also pleased to report a resurgence in revenue from the sales of textbooks and course materials. Additionally, we sustained a strong gross margin of 84.8%, a significant surge from 63.2% in the same period of last year, driven by our established business strategies and targeted restructuring efforts. Furthermore, our total cash position grew significantly to $84.15 million as of June 30, 2024, a notable increase from $20.34 million as of December 31, 2023. Those figures are a testament to the resilience of our business model and operations, and we expect to navigate short-term headwinds and resume our long-term growth trajectory. Looking forward, we remain confident in our business model and committed to translating our efforts into sustained growth and creating value for our shareholders.\"\n\n**First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Summary**\n\n**For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---  \n_($ millions, except for percentages or per share data)_ | **2024** | **2023** | **%Change**  \nRevenue | 0.89 | 1.36 | (34.8 %)  \nGross profit | 0.75 | 0.86 | (12.6 %)  \nGross margin | 84.8 % | 63.2 % | 21.5pp  \nLoss from operations | (4.56) | (0.74) | 515.7 %  \nNet (loss) income | (4.72) | 0.38 | NM  \nBasic and diluted (loss) earnings per share | (2.04) | 0.18 | NM  \n  \nNote: pp represents percentage points; NM represents not meaningful.\n\n  * Revenue was $0.89 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.36 million for the same period of last year.\n  * Gross profit was $0.75 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $0.86 million for the same period of last year.\n  * Gross margin was 84.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased by 21.5% from 63.2% for the same period of last year.\n  * Loss from operations was $4.56 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to income from operations of $0.74 million for the same period of last year.\n  * Net loss was $4.72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $0.38 million for the same period of last year.\n  * Basic and diluted loss per share were $2.04 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.18 for the same period of last year.\n\n\n\n**First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenue_**\n\nRevenue decreased by $0.5 million, or 34.8%, to $0.89 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from $1.36 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in revenue was mainly attributable to the decrease in revenue from technological consulting services for smart campus solutions in the first six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nRevenue from tailored job readiness training services decreased by $83,297, or 8.8% to $0.86 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from $0.94 million for the same period of last year, which was mainly attributed to the loss of certain customers, which reduced revenue contribution from tailored job readiness training services.\n\nRevenue from providing smart campus related technological consulting service decreased by $0.4 million, or 97.4%, to $0.01 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $0.41 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily because two projects were completed for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to six completed projects for the same period of last year. Also, the size and the scope of the projects carried out in the six months ended June 30, 2024 were smaller compared those completed in the six months ended June 30, 2023, and the service fees charged by the Company decreased accordingly.\n\nIn order to ensure the quality of course content delivered to students and to meet international standards, the Company developed, edited, and published 12 English textbooks and course materials with an emphasis on language training, and distributed these materials to students enrolled with Fuzhou Melbourne Polytechnic, a three-year college in China (\"FMP\") and Strait College of Minjiang University, a four-year university in China (\"Strait College\").

Revenue from textbooks and course material sales increased by $13,476, or 100.00%, to $13,476 for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from nil for the same period of last year. The increase was mainly attributed to the increased demand for textbooks and course materials. According to the Company's agreement with the publisher, the Company will be able to receive a fee only when the number of copies printed by the publisher exceed a pre-determined volume.\n\n**_Cost of Revenues_**\n\nCost of revenue decreased by $0.36 million, or 73.00%, to $0.14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $0.50 million for the same period of last year, primarily due to reduced average size and scope of the technology consulting projects completed in the six months ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, costs associated with hardware and components installation in Technology Consulting Services for Smart Campus related projects decreased significantly when comparing the six months ended June 30, 2024 to the six months ended June 30, 2023. Cost of revenue accounted for 15.2% and 36.8% of total revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**_Gross Profit_**\n\nGross profit decreased by $0.1 million, or 12.6%, to $0.75 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $0.86 million for the same period of last year, while gross profit margin increased by 21.5% to 84.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 63.2% for the same period of last year. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit contribution from smart campus related technological consulting services, which mainly resulted from the decrease in average project size and average gross profit per project for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of last year.\n\n**_Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_**\n\nThe Company maintain allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses.

The allowance for doubtful accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was mainly related to working capital provided for the two colleges, FMP and Strait College, which were expected to have collectability issues and allowance for doubtful accounts were made for the estimated losses.\n\n_**Operating Expenses**_\n\nSelling expenses decreased by $0.07 million, or 59.8%, to $0.04 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $0.11 million for the same period of last year.

Based on the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares for the 32 consecutive business days from July 8, 2024 to August 20, 2024, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.\n\nThe Notification Letter does not impact the Company's listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until February 17, 2025, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company's ordinary shares must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by February 17, 2025, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.\n\nThe Company's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ordinary shares and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a reverse share split of its outstanding ordinary shares, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n\n**About China Liberal Education Holdings Limited**\n\nChina Liberal is an educational services provider headquartered in Beijing, China.
