The sale generated a net gain attributable to the Company's common stockholders of\napproximately $8.7 million.\n• A joint venture in which we hold a combined preferred equity and common equity investment sold a multi-family\napartment community for approximately $43.5 million. The sale generated a net gain attributable to the Company's\ncommon stockholders of approximately $1.5 million.\n• Purchased approximately $372.2 million of Agency RMBS with an average coupon of 5.33%.\n• Purchased approximately $624.2 million in residential loans with an average gross coupon of 9.72%.\nFinancing Activities\n• Completed a securitization of business purpose loans, resulting in approximately $235.8 million in net proceeds to us\nafter deducting expenses associated with the transaction. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repay\napproximately $184.6 million on outstanding repurchase agreements related to residential loans.\n• Completed a re-securitization of our investment in certain subordinated securities issued by Consolidated SLST,\nresulting in approximately $73.0 million in net proceeds to us after deducting expenses associated with the transaction.\nWe utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $48.8 million on outstanding repurchase agreement\nfinancing related to our investment in Consolidated SLST.\nManagement Overview\nJason Serrano, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"The Company reported sharply higher earnings per share of\n$0.36 in the third quarter. The improved earnings were the result of a portfolio rotation which began over a year ago. As part\nof the plan, we focused on acquisitions that can deliver high recurring interest income by rotating from under-performing, total\nreturn opportunities. Consequently, the Company reported Total Adjusted Net Interest Income of $29 million in the third\nquarter, up 39% year-over-year.\nOver the year, we maintained a deliberate approach to balance sheet growth by prioritizing investments containing\nfundamentally stable income and did not veer from our objective. Going forward, we intend to unlock the Company’s excess\nliquidity for continued portfolio growth to further enhance Company earnings, particularly without any corporate debt maturity\nuntil 2026. We believe a patient approach for earnings growth is prudent in this market environment to increase stockholder\nvalue.\"\nCapital Allocation\nThe following table sets forth, by investment category, our allocated capital at September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in\nthousands):\nSingle-Family Multi- Corporate/\n(1) Family Other Total\nResidential loans $ 3,777,144 $ — $ — $ 3,777,144\nConsolidated SLST CDOs (845,811) — — (845,811)\nInvestment securities available for sale 3,036,182 — 349,088 3,385,270\nMulti-family loans — 87,614 — 87,614\nEquity investments — 100,378 46,455 146,833\nEquity investments in consolidated multi-family properties (2) — 154,462 — 154,462\nEquity investments in disposal group held for sale (3) — 17,831 — 17,831\nSingle-family rental properties 144,736 — — 144,736\nTotal investment portfolio carrying value 6,112,251 360,285 395,543 6,868,079\nLiabilities:\nRepurchase agreements (3,258,175) — (352,940) (3,611,115)\nCollateralized debt obligations\nResidential loan securitization CDOs (1,883,817) — — (1,883,817)\nNon-Agency RMBS re-securitization (72,638) — — (72,638)\nSenior unsecured notes — — (159,587) (159,587)\nSubordinated debentures — — (45,000) (45,000)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (4) 104,220 — 221,582 325,802\nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling\ninterest to estimated redemption value — (48,282) — (48,282)\nOther 111,504 (1,306) (39,493) 70,705\nNet Company capital allocated $ 1,113,345 $ 310,697 $ 20,105 $ 1,444,147\nCompany Recourse Leverage Ratio (5) 2.6x\nPortfolio Recourse Leverage Ratio (6) 2.5x\n(1) The Company, through its ownership of certain securities, has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Consolidated\nSLST and has consolidated the assets and liabilities of Consolidated SLST in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.

A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their\nmost directly comparable GAAP measure is included below in \"Reconciliation of Financial Information.\"\nReconciliation of Financial Information\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, including adjusted interest income, adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income (loss), yield on average\ninterest earning assets, average financing cost, net interest spread, undepreciated earnings (loss) and adjusted book value per\ncommon share. Our management team believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered with our GAAP\nfinancial statements, provide supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current\nperformance and trends using the metrics that management uses to operate our business. Our presentation of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations.\nBecause these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior\nto, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations of the non-\nGAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) and Net Interest Spread\nFinancial results for the Company during a given period include the net interest income earned on our investment\nportfolio of residential loans, investment securities and preferred equity investments and mezzanine loans, where the risks and\npayment characteristics are equivalent to and accounted for as loans (collectively, our “interest earning assets”). Adjusted net\ninterest income (loss) and net interest spread (both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures) are impacted by factors such\nas our cost of financing, including our hedging costs, and the interest rate that our investments bear. Furthermore, the amount of\npremium or discount paid on purchased investments and the prepayment rates on investments will impact adjusted net interest\nincome (loss) as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP financial measures, in total and by investment category, for the respective\nperiods:\n• adjusted interest income – calculated as our GAAP interest income reduced by the interest expense recognized on\nConsolidated SLST CDOs,\n• adjusted interest expense – calculated as our GAAP interest expense reduced by the interest expense recognized\non Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted to include the net interest component of interest rate swaps,\n• adjusted net interest income (loss) – calculated by subtracting adjusted interest expense from adjusted interest\nincome,\n• yield on average interest earning assets – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our\naverage interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the\nCompany,\n• average financing cost – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest expense and the average outstanding\nbalance of our interest bearing liabilities, excluding Consolidated SLST CDOs and mortgages payable on real\nestate, and\n• net interest spread – calculated as the difference between our yield on average interest earning assets and our\naverage financing cost.\nThese measures remove the impact of Consolidated SLST that we consolidate in accordance with GAAP and include\nthe net interest component of interest rate swaps utilized to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate\nborrowings, which is included in (losses) gains on derivative instruments, net in the Company's condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. With respect to Consolidated SLST, we only include the interest income earned by the Consolidated\nSLST securities that are actually owned by the Company as the Company only receives income or absorbs losses related to the\nConsolidated SLST securities actually owned by the Company. We include the net interest component of interest rate swaps in\nthese measures to more fully represent the cost of our financing strategy.\nWe provide the non-GAAP financial measures listed above because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide investors and management with additional detail and enhance their understanding of our interest earning asset yields, in\ntotal and by investment category, relative to the cost of our financing and the underlying trends within our portfolio of interest\nearning assets. In addition to the foregoing, our management team uses these measures to assess, among other things, the\nperformance of our interest earning assets in total and by asset, possible cash flows from our interest earning assets in total and\nby asset, our ability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing and the composition of our portfolio\nof interest earning assets, including acquisition and disposition determinations.\nA reconciliation of GAAP interest income to adjusted interest income, GAAP interest expense to adjusted interest\nexpense and GAAP total net

income.\nUndepreciated Earnings (Loss)\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP net income (loss)\nattributable to Company's common stockholders excluding the Company's share in depreciation expense and lease intangible\namortization expense, if any, related to operating real estate, net for which an impairment has not been recognized. By\nexcluding these non-cash adjustments from our operating results, we believe that the presentation of undepreciated earnings\n(loss) provides a consistent measure of our operating performance and useful information to investors to evaluate the effective\nnet return on our portfolio. In addition, we believe that presenting undepreciated earnings (loss) enables our investors to\nmeasure, evaluate, and compare our operating performance to that of our peers.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders to undepreciated earnings (loss)\nfor the respective periods ended is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December September\n30, 2024 2024 2024 31, 2023 30, 2023\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common\nstockholders $ 32,410 $ (26,028) $ (68,340) $ 31,465 $ (94,819)\nAdd:\nDepreciation expense on operating real estate 2,531 3,698 6,326 2,232 2,182\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) $ 34,941 $ (22,330) $ (62,014) $ 33,697 $ (92,637)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 90,582 90,989 91,117 90,683 90,984\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.39 $ (0.25) $ (0.68) $ 0.37 $ (1.02)\nAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share\nAdjusted book value per common share is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by making the\nfollowing adjustments to GAAP book value: (i) exclude the Company's share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible\namortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, (ii)\nexclude the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value and (iii) adjust our\namortized cost liabilities that finance our investment portfolio to fair value.\nOur rental property portfolio includes fee simple interests in single-family rental homes and joint venture equity\ninterests in multi-family properties owned by Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. By excluding our share of cumulative non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been\nrecognized, adjusted book value reflects the value, at their undepreciated basis, of our single-family rental properties and joint\nventure equity investments that the Company has determined to be recoverable at the end of the period.\nAdditionally, in connection with third party ownership of certain of the non-controlling interests in certain of the\nConsolidated Real Estate VIEs, we record redeemable non-controlling interests as mezzanine equity on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling interests may elect to sell their ownership interests\nto us at fair value once a year, subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, resulting in an adjustment of the\nredeemable non-controlling interests to fair value that is accounted for by us as an equity transaction in accordance with GAAP.\nA key component of the estimation of fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests is the estimated fair value of the\nmulti-family apartment properties held by the applicable Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. However, because the corresponding\nreal estate assets are not reported at fair value and thus not adjusted to reflect unrealized gains or losses in our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, the cumulative adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value directly\naffects our GAAP book value. By excluding the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated\nredemption value, adjusted book value more closely aligns the accounting treatment applied to these real estate assets and\nreflects our joint venture equity investment at its undepreciated basis.\nThe substantial majority of our remaining assets are financial or similar instruments that are carried at fair value in\naccordance with the fair value option in our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, unlike our use of the fair\nvalue option for the assets in our investment portfolio, certain CDOs issued by our residential loan securitizations, certain senior\nunsecured notes and subordinated debentures that finance our investment portfolio assets are carried at amortized cost in our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. By adjusting these financing instruments to fair value, adjusted book value reflects\nthe Company's net equity in investments on a comparable fair value basis.\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted book value per common share provides a useful measure for investors and\nus as it provides a consistent measure of our value, allows management to effectively consider our financial position and\nfacilitates the comparison of our financial performance to that of our peers.\nA reconciliation of GAAP book value to adjusted book value and calculation of adjusted book value per common\nshare as of the dates indicated is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December September\n30, 2024 2024 2024 31, 2023 30, 2023\nCompany's stockholders' equity $ 1,444,147 $ 1,431,910 $ 1,485,256 $ 1,579,612 $ 1,575,228\nPreferred stock liquidation preference (554,110) (554,110) (554,110) (554,110) (554,110)\nGAAP book value 890,037 877,800 931,146 1,025,502 1,021,118\nAdd:\nCumulative depreciation expense on real estate (1) 19,180 21,692 24,451 21,801 21,817\nCumulative amortization of lease intangibles related\nto real estate (1) 4,903 11,078 13,000 14,897 21,356\nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-\ncontrolling interest to estimated redemption value 48,282 44,053 36,489 30,062 17,043\nAdjustment of amortized cost liabilities to fair value 21,961 43,475 44,590 55,271 90,929\nAdjusted book value $ 984,363 $ 998,098 $ 1,049,676 $ 1,147,533 $ 1,172,263\nCommon shares outstanding 90,579 90,592 91,231 90,675 90,684\nGAAP book value per common share (2) $ 9.83 $ 9.69 $ 10.21 $ 11.31 $ 11.26\nAdjusted book value per common share (3) $ 10.87 $ 11.02 $ 11.51 $ 12.66 $ 12.93\n(1) Represents cumulative adjustments for the Company's share of depreciation expense and amortization of lease\nintangibles related to real estate held as of the end of the period presented for which an impairment has not been\nrecognized.\n(2) GAAP book value per common share is calculated using the GAAP book value and the common shares outstanding\nfor the periods indicated.\n(3) Adjusted book value per common share is calculated using the adjusted book value and the common shares\noutstanding for the periods indicated.\nEquity Investments in Multi-Family Entities\nWe own joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family properties. We determined that these joint\nventure entities are VIEs and that we are the primary beneficiary of all but two of these VIEs, resulting in consolidation of the\nVIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, including their assets, liabilities, income and expenses, in our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements with non-controlling interests for the third-party ownership of the joint ventures' membership\ninterests. With respect to the two additional joint venture equity investments for which we determined that we are not the\nprimary beneficiary, we record our equity investments at fair value.\nIn September 2022, the Company announced a repositioning of its business through the opportunistic disposition over\ntime of the Company's joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties and reallocation of its capital away from such\nassets to its targeted assets. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that certain joint venture equity\ninvestments meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs\nare reported in assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale.\nWe also own a preferred equity investment in a VIE that owns a multi-family property and for which, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company is the primary beneficiary, resulting in consolidation of the assets, liabilities, income and\nexpenses of the VIE in our condensed consolidated financial statements with a non-controlling interest for the third-party\nownership of the VIE's membership interests.\nA reconciliation of our net equity investments in consolidated multi-family properties and disposal group held for sale\nto our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 is shown below (dollar amounts in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 6,194\nReal estate, net (1) 610,967\nAssets of disposal group held for sale 197,665\nOther assets 21,981\nTotal assets $ 836,807\nMortgages payable on real estate, net $ 492,321\nLiabilities of disposal group held for sale 177,869\nOther liabilities 14,917\nTotal liabilities $ 685,107\nRedeemable non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs $ 21,826\nLess: Cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value (48,282)\nNon-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs 3,899\nNon-controlling interest in disposal group held for sale 1,964\nNet equity investment (2) $ 172,293\n(1) Includes real estate held for sale in the amount of $23.6 million.\n(2) The Company's net equity investment as of September 30, 2024 consists of $154.5 million of net equity investments in\nconsolidated multi-family properties and $17.8 million of net equity investments in disposal group held for sale."

If a change occurs, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may vary\nmaterially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements.\nThe following factors are examples of those that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements: changes in our business and\ninvestment strategy; inflation and changes in interest rates and the fair market value of our assets, including negative changes resulting in margin calls\nrelating to the financing of our assets; changes in credit spreads; changes in the long-term credit ratings of the U.S., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie\nMae; general volatility of the markets in which we invest; changes in prepayment rates on the loans we own or that underlie our investment securities;\nincreased rates of default, delinquency or vacancy and/or decreased recovery rates on or at our assets; our ability to identify and acquire our targeted\nassets, including assets in our investment pipeline; our ability to dispose of assets from time to time on terms favorable to us, including the disposition over\ntime of our joint venture equity investments; changes in our relationships with our financing counterparties and our ability to borrow to finance our assets\nand the terms thereof; changes in our relationships with and/or the performance of our operating partners; our ability to predict and control costs;\nchanges in laws, regulations or policies affecting our business; our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; our ability to maintain our\nqualification as a REIT for federal tax purposes; our ability to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as\namended; impairments in the value of the collateral underlying our investments; our ability to manage or hedge credit risk, interest rate risk, and other\nfinancial and operational risks; our exposure to liquidity risk, risks associated with the use of leverage, and market risks; and risks associated with investing\nin real estate assets, including changes in business conditions and the general economy, the availability of investment opportunities and the conditions in\nthe market for investment securities, residential loans, structured multi-family investments and other mortgage-, residential housing- and credit-related\nassets.\nThese and other risks, uncertainties and factors, including the risk factors and other information described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nas updated and supplemented from time to time, and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other information that we file from time to time\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), could cause our\nactual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make.

The improved earnings were the result of a\nportfolio rotation which began over a year ago. As part of the plan, we focused on acquisitions that can deliver high recurring interest\nincome by rotating from under-performing, total return opportunities. Consequently, the Company reported Total Adjusted Net Interest\nIncome of $29 million in the third quarter, up 39% year-over-year.\nOver the year, we maintained a deliberate approach to balance sheet growth by prioritizing investments containing fundamentally stable\nincome and did not veer from our objective. Going forward, we intend to unlock the Company’s excess liquidity for continued portfolio\ngrowth to further enhance Company earnings, particularly without any corporate debt maturity until 2026. We believe a patient approach\nfor earnings growth is prudent in this market environment to increase stockholder value.\"\n— Jason Serrano, Chief Executive Officer\n3\nTable of Contents\n• Company Overview\n• Financial Summary\n• Market & Strategy\nUpdate\n• Quarterly Financial\nInformation\n• Appendix\n4\nCompany\nOverview\n5\nNYMT Overview\nCapital Allocation\nNew York Mortgage Trust, Inc.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the Appendix.\n36\nAppendix\n37\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Interest Income and Net Interest Spread\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this supplemental presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted interest income,\nadjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income (loss), yield on average interest earning assets, average financing cost, net interest spread, undepreciated earnings (loss) and\nadjusted book value per common share. Our management team believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provide\nsupplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current performance and trends using the metrics that management uses to operate our business. Our\npresentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. Because these measures are\nnot calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial\nresults and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this supplemental presentation to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in\naccordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\nFinancial results for the Company during a given period include the net interest income earned on our investment portfolio of residential loans, investment securities and preferred\nequity investments and mezzanine loans, where the risks and payment characteristics are equivalent to and accounted for as loans (collectively, our “interest earning assets”). Adjusted\nnet interest income (loss) and net interest spread (both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures) are impacted by factors such as our cost of financing, including our hedging costs,\nand the interest rate that our investments bear. Furthermore, the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased investments and the prepayment rates on investments will impact\nadjusted net interest income (loss) as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP financial measures, in total and by investment category, for the respective periods:\n• Adjusted Interest Income – calculated as our GAAP interest income reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs,\n• Adjusted Interest Expense – calculated as our GAAP interest expense reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted to include the net\ninterest component of interest rate swaps,\n• Adjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) – calculated by subtracting Adjusted Interest Expense from Adjusted Interest Income,\n• Yield on Average Interest Earning Assets – calculated as the quotient of our Adjusted Interest Income and our average interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST\nassets other than those securities owned by the Company,\n• Average Financing Cost – calculated as the quotient of our Adjusted Interest Expense and the average outstanding balance of our interest bearing liabilities, excluding\nConsolidated SLST CDOs and mortgages payable on real estate, and\n• Net Interest Spread – calculated as the difference between our Yield on Average Interest Earning Assets and our Average Financing Cost.\nThese measures remove the impact of Consolidated SLST that we consolidate in accordance with GAAP and include the net interest component of interest rate swaps utilized to hedge\nthe variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings, which is included in (losses) gains on derivative instruments, net in the Company's condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. With respect to Consolidated SLST, we only include the interest income earned by the Consolidated SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company\nas the Company only receives income or absorbs losses related to the Consolidated SLST securities actually owned by the Company. We include the net interest component of interest\nrate swaps in these measures to more fully represent the cost of our financing strategy.\nWe provide the non-GAAP financial measures listed above because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with additional detail and\nenhance their understanding of our interest earning asset yields, in total and by investment category, relative to the cost of our financing and the underlying trends within our portfolio\nof interest earning assets. In addition to the foregoing, our management team uses these measures to assess, among other things, the performance of our interest earning assets in\ntotal and by asset, possible cash flows from our interest earning assets in total and by asset, our ability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing and the\ncomposition of our portfolio of interest earning assets, including acquisition and disposition determinations.\nThe following slides present reconciliations of GAAP interest income to Adjusted Interest Income, GAAP interest expense to Adjusted Interest Expense and GAAP net interest income\n(loss) to Adjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) for our single-family and corporate/other portfolios and the Company for the periods indicated.\nSee Glossary and End Notes in the Appendix.\n38\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Single-Family Adjusted Net Interest Income\nDollar Amounts in Thousands 3Q'24 2Q'24 1Q'24 4Q'23 3Q'23\nSingle-Family\nGAAP interest income $ 104,608 $ 88,067 $ 81,227 $ 76,119 $ 61,346\nGAAP interest expense (81,214) (67,434) (61,740) (57,489) (44,101)\nGAAP total net interest income $ 23,394 $ 20,633 $ 19,487 $ 18,630 $ 17,245\nGAAP interest income $ 104,608 $ 88,067 $ 81,227 $ 76,119 $ 61,346\nAdjusted for:\nConsolidated SLST CDO interest expense (7,375) (6,752) (5,801) (6,268) (5,957)\nAdjusted Interest Income $ 97,233 $ 81,315 $ 75,426 $ 69,851 $ 55,389\nGAAP interest expense $ (81,214) $ (67,434) $ (61,740) $ (57,489) $ (44,101)\nAdjusted for:\nConsolidated SLST CDO interest expense 7,375 6,752 5,801 6,268 5,957\nNet interest benefit of interest rate swaps 7,542 7,631 7,177 5,703 2,994\nAdjusted Interest Expense $ (66,297) $ (53,051) $ (48,762) $ (45,518) $ (35,150)\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (1) $ 30,936 $ 28,264 $ 26,664 $ 24,333 $ 20,239\n1.

By excluding these non-cash adjustments from our operating\nresults, we believe that the presentation of Undepreciated Earnings (Loss) provides a consistent measure of our operating performance and\nuseful information to investors to evaluate the effective net return on our portfolio. In addition, we believe that presenting Undepreciated\nEarnings (Loss) enables our investors to measure, evaluate, and compare our operating performance to that of our peers.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders to Undepreciated Earnings (Loss) for the periods\nindicated is presented below:\nDollar Amounts in Thousands (except per share data) 3Q'24 2Q'24 1Q'24 4Q'23 3Q'23\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common\n$ 32,410 $ (26,028) $ (68,340) $ 31,465 $ (94,819)\nstockholders\nAdd:\nDepreciation expense on operating real estate 2,531 3,698 6,326 2,232 2,182\nUndepreciated Earnings (Loss) $ 34,941 $ (22,330) $ (62,014) $ 33,697 $ (92,637)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 90,582 90,989 91,117 90,683 90,984\nUndepreciated Earnings (Loss) per common share $ 0.39 $ (0.25) $ (0.68) $ 0.37 $ (1.02)\nSee Glossary and End Notes in the Appendix.\n42\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share\nAdjusted book value per common share is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by making the following adjustments to GAAP book value: (i)\nexclude the Company's share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for\nwhich an impairment has not been recognized, (ii) exclude the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value\nand (iii) adjust our amortized cost liabilities that finance our investment portfolio to fair value.\nOur rental property portfolio includes fee simple interests in single-family rental homes and joint venture equity interests in multi-family properties owned by\nConsolidated Real Estate VIEs. By excluding our share of cumulative non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of\nthe period for which an impairment has not been recognized, adjusted book value reflects the value, at their undepreciated basis, of our single-family rental\nproperties and joint venture equity investments that the Company has determined to be recoverable at the end of the period.\nAdditionally, in connection with third party ownership of certain of the non-controlling interests in certain of the Consolidated Real Estate VIEs, we record\nredeemable non-controlling interests as mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling\ninterests may elect to sell their ownership interests to us at fair value once a year, subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, resulting in an\nadjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value that is accounted for by us as an equity transaction in accordance with GAAP. A key\ncomponent of the estimation of fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests is the estimated fair value of the multi-family apartment properties held by\nthe applicable Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. However, because the corresponding real estate assets are not reported at fair value and thus not adjusted to\nreflect unrealized gains or losses in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the cumulative adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to\nfair value directly affects our GAAP book value. By excluding the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value,\nAdjusted Book Value more closely aligns the accounting treatment applied to these real estate assets and reflects our joint venture equity investment at its\nundepreciated basis.\nThe substantial majority of our remaining assets are financial or similar instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option in our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements. However, unlike our use of the fair value option for the assets in our investment portfolio, certain CDOs issued by\nour residential loan securitizations, certain senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures that finance our investment portfolio assets are carried at\namortized cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. By adjusting these financing instruments to fair value, Adjusted Book Value reflects the\nCompany's net equity in investments on a comparable fair value basis.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted Book Value per common share provides a useful measure for investors and us as it provides a consistent measure\nof our value, allows management to effectively consider our financial position and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to that of our peers.\nThe following slide presents a reconciliation of GAAP book value to Adjusted Book Value and calculation of Adjusted Book Value per common share as of the\ndates indicated.\nSee Glossary and End Notes in the Appendix.\n43\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliation of Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share\nDollar Amounts in Thousands (except per share data) 3Q'24 2Q'24 1Q'24 4Q'23 3Q'23\nCompany's stockholders' equity $ 1,444,147 $ 1,431,910 $ 1,485,256 $ 1,579,612 $ 1,575,228\nPreferred stock liquidation preference (554,110) (554,110) (554,110) (554,110) (554,110)\nGAAP Book Value 890,037 877,800 931,146 1,025,502 1,021,118\nAdd:\nCumulative depreciation expense on real estate (1) 19,180 21,692 24,451 21,801 21,817\nCumulative amortization of lease intangibles related to real\nestate (1) 4,903 11,078 13,000 14,897 21,356\nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest\n48,282 44,053 36,489 30,062 17,043\nto estimated redemption value\nAdjustment of amortized cost liabilities to fair value 21,961 43,475 44,590 55,271 90,929\nAdjusted Book Value $ 984,363 $ 998,098 $ 1,049,676 $ 1,147,533 $ 1,172,263\nCommon shares outstanding 90,579 90,592 91,231 90,675 90,684\nGAAP book value per common share $ 9.83 $ 9.69 $ 10.21 $ 11.31 $ 11.26\nAdjusted Book Value per Common Share $ 10.87 $ 11.02 $ 11.51 $ 12.66 $ 12.93\n1.

Organization\nNew York Mortgage Trust, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“NYMT,” “we,” “our,” or the “Company”), is an internally-managed real\nestate investment trust (\"REIT\") in the business of acquiring, investing in, financing and managing primarily mortgage-related single-family and multi-family\nresidential assets. Our objective is to deliver long-term stable distributions to our stockholders over changing economic conditions through a combination of net\ninterest spread and capital gains from a diversified investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio includes credit sensitive single-family and multi-family assets,\nas well as more traditional types of fixed-income investments that provide coupon income, such as Agency RMBS.\nThe Company conducts its business through the parent company, New York Mortgage Trust, Inc., and several subsidiaries, including taxable REIT\nsubsidiaries (“TRSs”), qualified REIT subsidiaries (“QRSs”) and special purpose subsidiaries established for securitization purposes.

Accordingly, all common share and per common share data for all periods presented in these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the impact of the Reverse Stock Split.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from audited financial statements. The\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 are unaudited. In our opinion, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the Company’s\nfinancial position, results of operations and cash flows have been made. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements\nprepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X and the instructions to Form 10-Q. These\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly,\nsignificant accounting policies and other disclosures have been omitted since such items are disclosed in Note 2 in the audited consolidated financial statements\nand notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Provided in this section is a summary of additional\naccounting policies that are significant to, or newly adopted by, the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The results of operations\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets\nand liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during\nthe reporting period. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including fair valuation of its financial instruments reported at fair value, real\nestate held by Consolidated VIEs and redemption value of redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated VIEs. Although the Company’s estimates\ncontemplate current conditions and how it expects those conditions to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than\nanticipated in those estimates, which could materially impact the Company’s results of operations and its financial condition.\nReclassifications – Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to\ncurrent period presentation. In particular, prior period disclosures have been adjusted for the aforementioned Reverse Stock Split.\nAdditionally, prior period disclosures have been conformed to the current period presentation of net loss from real estate. Beginning in the third quarter\nof 2023, the components of net loss from real estate, inclusive of rental income and other real estate income and interest expense, mortgages payable on real\nestate, depreciation and amortization and other real estate expenses, are presented as total net loss from real estate on the Company's condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. Previously, rental income, other real estate income and total income from real estate was presented in other income (loss) and interest\nexpense, mortgages payable on real estate, depreciation and amortization, other real estate expenses and total expenses related to real estate were presented in\ngeneral, administrative and operating expenses on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAlso beginning in the third quarter of 2023, unrealized gains (losses) and realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments are presented in gains (losses)\non derivative instruments, net on the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. Previously, unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments\nwere presented in unrealized gains (losses), net and realized gains (losses) on derivative instruments were presented in realized gains (losses), net on the\nCompany's condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Variable Interest Entities – The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the\naccounts of all its subsidiaries which are majority-owned, controlled by the Company or a VIE where the Company is the primary beneficiary. All significant\nintercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation (see Note 7).\n14\nTable of Contents\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not\nhave the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties. The Company consolidates a VIE in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (\"ASC 810\") when it is the\nprimary beneficiary of such VIE, herein referred to as a Consolidated VIE. As primary beneficiary, the Company has both the power to direct the activities that\nmost significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant\nto the VIE. The Company is required to reconsider its evaluation of whether to consolidate a VIE each reporting period, based upon changes in the facts and\ncircumstances pertaining to the VIE.\nThe Company evaluates the initial consolidation of each Consolidated VIE, which includes a determination of whether the VIE constitutes the definition\nof a business in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations (\"ASC 805\"), by considering if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets within the\nVIE are concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or group of single identifiable assets. Upon consolidation, the Company recognizes the assets acquired,\nthe liabilities assumed, and any third-party ownership of membership interests as non-controlling interest as of the consolidation or acquisition date, measured at\ntheir relative fair values (see Note 7). Non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs is adjusted prospectively for its share of the allocation of income or loss and\nequity contributions and distributions from each respective Consolidated VIE. The third-party owners of certain of the non-controlling interests in Consolidated\nVIEs have the ability to sell their ownership interests to the Company, at their election, subject to certain conditions. The Company has classified these third-\nparty ownership interests as redeemable non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs in mezzanine equity on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nCollateralized Debt Obligations – The Company records collateralized debt obligations used to permanently finance the residential loans held in\nConsolidated SLST, a portion of the Company's net investment in Consolidated SLST and the Company's residential loans held in securitization trusts as debt on\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. For financial reporting purposes, the loans and investment securities held as collateral for these\nobligations are recorded as assets of the Company. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825, Financial Instruments (\"ASC 825\") with\nrespect to the CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST and CDOs issued by the Company after January 1, 2024. The Company elected the fair value option for CDOs\nissued by the Company after January 1, 2024 because the Company determined that such presentation represents the underlying economics of the respective\nfinancing. Changes in fair value of CDOs subject to the fair value election are recorded in current period earnings in unrealized gains (losses), net on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. Interest expense on such CDOs is recorded based on the current stated interest rate and\noutstanding principal balance in effect and is included in interest expense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. In accordance\nwith ASC 825, costs associated with the issuance of CDOs subject to the fair value election are recognized in earnings as they are incurred and are included in\ndebt issuance costs on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nSenior Unsecured Notes – On April 27, 2021, the Company issued its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2026 to originate new investments, repay outstanding\nindebtedness and for general corporate purposes. The Company evaluated the call option feature of these notes for embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC\n815, Derivatives and Hedging (\"ASC 815\") and determined that the call option feature should not be bifurcated from the notes.\nOn June 28, 2024, the Company issued its 9.125% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \"9.125% Senior Notes\") for general corporate purposes, which included\nacquiring single-family residential assets. The Company evaluated the call option feature of these notes for embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC 815\nand determined that the call option feature should not be bifurcated from the notes. The Company has elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825 with\nrespect to the 9.125% Senior Notes because the Company determined that such presentation represents the underlying economics of the respective financing.\nChanges in fair value of the 9.125% Senior Notes are recorded in current period earnings in unrealized gains (losses), net on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations (or other comprehensive income, to the extent the change results from a change in instrument-specific credit risk). Interest\nexpense on such 9.125% Senior Notes is recorded based on the current stated interest rate and outstanding principal balance in effect and is included in interest\nexpense on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with ASC 825, costs associated with the issuance of the 9.125%\nSenior Notes are recognized in earnings as they are incurred and are included in debt issuance costs on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures (\"ASU 2023-09\"). ASU 2023-09 requires enhanced disclosures in connection with an entity's effective tax rate reconciliation and additional\ndisclosures about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects that the adoption of\nASU 2023-09 will result in additional income tax disclosures in its notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\"ASU 2023-\n07\"). ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. The amendments also require companies with a\nsingle reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by ASU 2023-07 as well as existing segment disclosures in accordance with ASC 280. ASU 2023-07\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company\nexpects that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will result in additional disclosures in its notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting (\"ASU 2020-04\"). ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions to GAAP requirements for modifications to debt agreements, leases,\nderivatives and other contracts, related to the expected market transition from LIBOR, and certain other floating rate benchmark indices, or collectively, IBORs,\nto alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 generally considers contract modifications related to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require\ncontract remeasurement at the modification date nor a reassessment of a previous accounting determination. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (\"ASU 2022-06\"), which allows ASU 2020-04 to be adopted and applied\nprospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2024. In light of the cessation of the publication of LIBOR after June 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s material contracts that were indexed to LIBOR have been amended to transition to an alternative benchmark and any other unmodified agreements\nthat incorporate LIBOR as the referenced rate have provisions in place that provide for identification of an alternative benchmark or specify an alternative\nbenchmark, or by operation of law specify an alternative benchmark, to LIBOR upon its phase-out.\n16\nTable of Contents\n3.

Use of Special Purpose Entities (SPE) and Variable Interest Entities (VIE)\nFinancing VIEs\nThe Company uses SPEs to facilitate transactions that involve securitizing financial assets or re-securitizing previously securitized financial assets. The\nobjective of such transactions may include obtaining non-recourse financing, obtaining liquidity or refinancing the underlying securitized financial assets on\nimproved terms. Securitization involves transferring assets to an SPE to convert all or a portion of those assets into cash before they would have been realized in\nthe normal course of business through the SPE’s issuance of debt or equity instruments. Investors in an SPE usually have recourse only to the assets in the SPE\nand depending on the overall structure of the transaction, may benefit from various forms of credit enhancement, such as over-collateralization in the form of\nexcess assets in the SPE, priority with respect to receipt of cash flows relative to holders of other debt or equity instruments issued by the SPE, or a line of credit\nor other form of liquidity agreement that is designed with the objective of ensuring that investors receive principal and/or interest cash flow on the investment in\naccordance with the terms of their investment agreement.\nThe Company has entered into financing transactions, including residential loan securitizations and re-securitizations, which required the Company to\nanalyze and determine whether the SPEs that were created to facilitate the transactions are VIEs in accordance with ASC 810 and if so, whether the Company is\nthe primary beneficiary requiring consolidation.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed a re-securitization of its investment in certain subordinated securities\nissued by Consolidated SLST (see below) for which the Company received net proceeds of approximately $73.0 million after deducting expenses associated with\nthe securitization transaction. The Company refers to this securitization as a non-Agency RMBS re-securitization. The Company engaged in the re-securitization\ntransaction primarily for the purpose of obtaining non-recourse, longer-term financing on a portion of its investment in Consolidated SLST. The Company\nremains economically exposed to the subordinated positions in the portion of Consolidated SLST transferred to the securitization and continues to consolidate\nConsolidated SLST.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed four securitizations of certain residential loans for which the Company\nreceived net proceeds of approximately $974.3 million after deducting expenses associated with the securitization transactions. The Company engaged in these\ntransactions for the purpose of obtaining non-recourse, longer-term financing on a portion of its residential loan portfolio. The residential loans serving as\ncollateral for the financings are comprised of performing, re-performing and non-performing and business purpose loans which are included in residential loans,\nat fair value on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company exercised its right to an optional redemption of two of its residential loan\nsecuritizations with an outstanding principal balance of $193.3 million at the time of redemption, returned the assets held by the trust to the Company and\nrecognized $0.7 million of loss on the extinguishment of collateralized debt obligations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company evaluated its residential loan securitizations and its non-Agency RMBS re-securitization and concluded that\nthe entities created to facilitate each of the financing transactions are VIEs and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs (each a “Financing\nVIE” and collectively, the “Financing VIEs”). As of December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated its residential loan securitizations and concluded that the\nentities created to facilitate each of the financing transactions are VIEs and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. Accordingly, the\nCompany consolidated the then-outstanding Financing VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n26\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated SLST\nThe Company invests in subordinated securities that represent the first loss position of the Freddie Mac-sponsored residential loan securitizations from\nwhich they were issued and certain IOs issued from the securitizations. The Company has evaluated its investments in these securitization trusts to determine\nwhether they are VIEs and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. The Company has determined that the Freddie Mac-\nsponsored residential loan securitization trusts, which we collectively refer to as Consolidated SLST, are VIEs and that the Company is the primary beneficiary\nof the VIEs within Consolidated SLST. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of such VIEs in the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated financial statements (see Notes 2, 3 and 13). The Company has elected the fair value option on the assets and liabilities held within\nConsolidated SLST, which requires that changes in valuations in the assets and liabilities of Consolidated SLST be reflected in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Consolidated SLST is comprised of two securitization trusts and one securitization trust as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested in subordinated securities issued by a Freddie Mac-sponsored residential loan\nsecuritization, resulting in the initial consolidation of the VIE as shown below (dollar amounts in thousands):\nResidential loans, at fair value $ 285,057\nCollateralized debt obligations, at fair value (275,200)\nNet investment $ 9,857\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Consolidated SLST securities owned by the Company had a fair value of $157.5 million and\n$157.2 million, respectively (see Note 16). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed a re-securitization of its investment in\ncertain subordinated securities issued by Consolidated SLST. The Company’s investments in Consolidated SLST securities were not included as collateral to any\nFinancing VIE as of December 31, 2023.\nConsolidated Real Estate VIEs\nThe Company owns joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family apartment communities, which the Company determined to be\nVIEs and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of these VIEs in\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements with non-controlling interests or redeemable non-controlling interests for the third-party\nownership of the joint ventures' membership interests.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its joint venture equity investments in four and six multi-family\nproperties, respectively, which resulted in the de-consolidation of the joint venture entities' assets and liabilities (see Note 9).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reconsidered its evaluation of its variable interest in a VIE that owned a multi-family\napartment community and in which the Company held a preferred equity investment. The Company determined that it gained the power to direct the activities,\nand became primary beneficiary, of the VIE and consolidated this VIE into its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounted for the initial consolidation of the Consolidated Real Estate VIEs in accordance with asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805,\nas substantially all of the fair value of the assets within the entities are concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\nIn analyzing whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the Financing VIEs, Consolidated SLST and Consolidated Real Estate VIEs, the\nCompany considered its involvement in each of the VIEs, including the design and purpose of each VIE, and whether its involvement reflected a controlling\nfinancial interest that resulted in the Company being deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. In determining whether the Company would be considered the\nprimary beneficiary, the following factors were assessed:\n• whether the Company has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and\n27\nTable of Contents\n• whether the Company has a right to receive benefits or absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE.\nThe following table presents a summary of the assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests of the Company's securitizations, Consolidated SLST and\nConsolidated Real Estate VIEs as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands).

The Company has classified these third-party ownership interests as redeemable non-controlling interests in Consolidated VIEs in mezzanine\nequity on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling interests may elect to sell their ownership\ninterests to the Company at fair value once a year and the sales are subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations.\nThe following table presents activity in redeemable non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 23,088 $ 34,571 $ 28,061 $ 63,803\nContributions 7 — 46 —\nDistributions (4,934) (41) (4,959) (3,991)\nNet loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest in\nConsolidated VIEs (565) (2,907) (19,543) (11,592)\nAdjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated\nredemption value (1) 4,230 (10,597) 18,221 (27,194)\nEnding balance $ 21,826 $ 21,026 $ 21,826 $ 21,026\n(1) The Company determines the fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interest utilizing market assumptions and discounted cash flows. The\nCompany applies a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows from the multi-family apartment properties held by the applicable Consolidated VIEs\nthat are allocatable to the redeemable non-controlling interest. This fair value measurement is generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, is\nclassified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the estimation of fair value of redeemable non-controlling\ninterest as of September 30, 2024 include a weighted average capitalization rate of 5.8% (ranges from 5.3% to 6.5%) and a weighted average discount\nrate of 14.8% (ranges from 13.6% to 15.6%).\n31\nTable of Contents\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company evaluated its investment securities available for sale and preferred equity, equity and\nother investments to determine whether they are VIEs and should be consolidated by the Company.

Accordingly, the real\nestate, net related to certain joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties is included in assets of disposal group held for sale on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 9 for additional information.\nMulti-family Apartment Properties\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family apartment\ncommunities, which the Company determined to be VIEs and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the\njoint venture entities into its condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 7). During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\ndetermined that two of the multi-family apartment communities owned by an entity in which the Company holds a joint venture equity investment that is not in\ndisposal group held for sale met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, transferred the properties held by the joint venture entity from operating real estate to\nreal estate held for sale and recognized no loss.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, an entity in which the Company holds a joint venture equity investment that is not in disposal group\nheld for sale sold one of its multi-family apartment communities for approximately $43.5 million, subject to certain prorations and adjustments typical in such\nreal estate transactions, including the assumption of the related mortgage payable in the amount of approximately $24.1 million. The sale generated a net gain of\napproximately $6.6 million and accelerated amortization of remaining loan costs of approximately $0.1 million, both of which are included in other income on\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The sale also generated net income attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately\n$5.0 million, resulting in a net gain attributable to the Company's common stockholders of approximately $1.5 million. As of September 30, 2024, one multi-\nfamily apartment community owned by the entity in which the Company holds a joint venture equity investment remains classified as held for sale.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company became the primary beneficiary of a VIE that owns a multi-family apartment community and\nin which the Company holds a preferred equity investment. Accordingly, the Company consolidated the VIE into its condensed consolidated financial statements\n(see Note 7).\nThe multi-family apartment communities generally lease their apartment units to individual tenants at market rates for the production of rental income.\nThese apartment units are generally leased at a fixed monthly rate with no option for the lessee to purchase the leased unit at any point.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOperating real estate, net is periodically evaluated for impairment. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that two multi-family properties\nowned by joint venture equity investments were impaired. The calculation of impairment amounts utilized fair values that were estimated based upon discounted\ncash flow analyses using property financial information and assumptions regarding market rent, revenue and expense growth, capitalization rates and equity\nreturn rates. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $4.6 million and $18.4 million impairment of real estate in the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively.\nSingle-family Rental Properties\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned single-family rental homes. These units are leased to individual tenants for the\nproduction of rental income and are generally leased at a fixed monthly rate with no option for the lessee to purchase the leased unit at any point.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined that certain single-family rental properties met the criteria to be classified\nas held for sale, transferred the properties from operating real estate to real estate held for sale and recognized a $4.0 million loss upon transfer, which is included\nin impairment of real estate on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company recognized a $0.6 million net recovery of\nimpairment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $4.0 million of net impairment losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold single-family rental properties for proceeds of approximately $2.7\nmillion and $4.5 million, respectively, recognizing net losses on sale of approximately $0.1 million and net gains on sale of approximately $0.2 million,\nrespectively, which is included in other income on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nLease Intangibles\nIntangibles related to multi-family properties consist of the value of in-place leases and are included in other assets on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.

Assets and Liabilities of Disposal Group Held for Sale\nIn September 2022, the Company announced a repositioning of its business through the opportunistic disposition over time of the Company's joint\nventure equity investments in multi-family properties and reallocation of its capital away from such assets to its targeted assets. Accordingly, the Company\ndetermined that certain joint venture equity investments met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and transferred either the assets and liabilities of the\nrespective Consolidated VIEs or its equity investment in the joint venture entity to assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale. In December 2023, the\nCompany suspended the marketing of nine joint venture equity investments that were reported in assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale primarily\ndue to unfavorable market conditions and a lack of transactional activity in the multi-family market. As such, the Company determined that these joint venture\nequity investments no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and transferred either the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs or\nits equity investment in the joint venture entity to their respective categories or equity investments, at fair value, respectively, on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2023.\nIn March 2024, the Company suspended the marketing of one additional joint venture equity investment, determined that it no longer met the criteria to\nbe classified as held for sale and transferred the assets and liabilities of the Consolidated VIE to their respective categories on the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2024. As a result of this transfer, the Company adjusted the carrying value of the long-lived assets in the\nConsolidated VIE to the lower of the carrying amount before the assets were classified as held for sale adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that\nwould have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used and the fair value of the assets at the date of the transfer and recognized\nan approximately $14.6 million loss on reclassification of disposal group during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nIn June 2024, in response to productive negotiations with operating partners and increased transactional activity, the Company determined that five joint\nventure equity investments met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and transferred the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs to assets\nand liabilities of disposal group held for sale. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $1.8 million included in impairment of real estate in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations during the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold its joint venture equity investments in four and six multi-family\nproperties, respectively, which resulted in the de-consolidation of the joint venture entities' assets and liabilities and a gain on de-consolidation of approximately\n$3.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively, which is included in other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, one of the joint ventures in which the Company held a common equity investment that is in\ndisposal group held for sale sold its multi-family apartment community for approximately $56.4 million, subject to certain prorations and adjustments typical in\nsuch real estate transactions, and repaid the related mortgage payable in the amount of approximately $31.8 million. The sale generated a net gain of\napproximately $11.4 million and a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.6 million, both of which are included in other income on the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The sale also generated net income attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $1.1\nmillion, resulting in net gain attributable to the Company's common stockholders of approximately $8.7 million.\nIn September 2024, in response to productive negotiations with operating partners and increased transactional activity, the Company determined that\ntwo joint venture equity investments met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and transferred the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs\nto assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. As a result, the\nCompany recognized a loss of $2.0 million included in impairment of real estate in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024. Four joint venture equity investments are classified as disposal group held for sale as of September 30, 2024.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the carrying values of the major classes of assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,044 $ 5,676\nReal estate, net 185,891 407,834\nOther assets 8,730 12,507\nTotal assets of disposal group held for sale (1) $ 197,665 $ 426,017\nMortgages payable on real estate, net (2) $ 170,318 $ 378,386\nOther liabilities 7,551 7,638\nTotal liabilities of disposal group held for sale (1) $ 177,869 $ 386,024\n(1) Assets and liabilities of the disposal group held for sale are in Consolidated VIEs because the Company is the primary beneficiary.\n(2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, two entities in which the Company holds joint venture equity investments entered into debt\nrestructuring agreements with the respective senior lender for their mortgage payables. As part of the agreements, a portion of interest payments will be\ndeferred until the maturity date. The restructurings did not result in a change in the carrying amount of the mortgage payables and no gains were\nrecorded.\nAlso included in the disposal group held for sale are non-controlling interests in Consolidated VIEs in the amount of $2.0 million and $3.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nReal estate, net included in assets of disposal group held for sale is recorded at the lower of the net carrying amount of the assets or the estimated fair\nvalue, net of selling costs. Fair value for real estate, net was based upon a discounted cash flow analysis using property financial information and assumptions\nregarding market rent, revenue and expense growth, capitalization rates and equity return rates. For real estate, net of the disposal group held for sale as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company recognized impairment losses of $3.8 million and $25.8 million, inclusive of losses recognized upon transfer into disposal\ngroup held for sale, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the fair values, net of selling costs of multi-\nfamily properties owned by seven of the joint venture entities in which we hold equity investments were less than the properties' net carrying values.\nAccordingly, the Company recognized net impairment losses of $44.2 million and $71.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. Impairment on real estate, net of recovery of previously impaired real estate, is included in impairment of real estate on the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company enters into derivative\nfinancial instruments in connection with its risk management activities. These derivative instruments may include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, credit\ndefault swaps, futures and options contracts such as options on credit default swap indices, equity index options, swaptions and options on futures. The Company\nmay also pursue forward-settling purchases or sales of Agency RMBS where the underlying pools of mortgage loans are “To-Be-Announced,” or TBAs,\npurchase options on U.S. Treasury futures or invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities. The Company elected not to apply hedge accounting for its\nderivative instruments.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe Company and Consolidated Real Estate VIEs are required by lenders on certain repurchase agreement financing and variable-rate mortgages\npayable on real estate to enter into interest rate cap contracts that limit the indexed portion of the interest rate on the respective related financing to a strike rate\nbased upon various SOFR tenors.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps generally\ninvolve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty, based on SOFR, in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the\ninterest rate swap without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to manage its position with regard to its\nliabilities, the Company may also enter into interest rate swaps which involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company\nmaking variable-rate payments, based on SOFR, over the life of the interest rate swap without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The variable rate the\nCompany pays or receives under its swap agreements has the effect of offsetting the repricing characteristics and cash flows of the Company's financing\narrangements.\nThe Company has purchased credit default swap index contracts under which a counterparty, in exchange for a premium, agrees to compensate the\nCompany for the financial loss associated with the occurrence of a credit event in relation to a notional value of an index. The Company may purchase equity\nindex put options that give the Company the right to sell or buy the underlying index at a specified strike price and U.S. Treasury future contracts that obligate\nthe Company to sell or buy U.S. Treasury securities for future delivery.

These contracts contain legally enforceable\nprovisions that allow for netting or setting off of all individual derivative receivables and payables with each counterparty and therefore, the fair values of those\nderivative contracts are reported net by counterparty. All of the Company’s interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are cleared through two central clearing\nhouses, CME Group Inc. (\"CME Clearing\"), which is the parent company of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., or the Intercontinental Exchange (\"ICE\").\nCME Clearing and ICE serve as the counterparty to every cleared transaction, becoming the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer, limiting the credit\nrisk by guaranteeing the financial performance of both parties and netting down exposures. The Company also exchanges variation margin based upon daily\nchanges in fair value, as measured by CME Clearing and ICE. The exchange of variation margin is treated as a legal settlement of the exposure under these\ncontracts, as opposed to pledged collateral. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the receipt or payment of variation margin as a direct reduction of or increase\nin the carrying value of the related asset or liability.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of gross derivative assets and liabilities to net amounts presented in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNet Amounts of\nGross Amount of Gross Amounts Assets (Liabilities)\nRecognized Assets Offset in Balance Presented in\n(Liabilities) Sheets Variation Margin Balance Sheets\nDerivative assets\nInterest rate caps $ 1,481 $ — $ — $ 1,481\nInterest rate swaps 9,307 (9,307) — —\nTotal derivative assets $ 10,788 $ (9,307) $ — $ 1,481\nDerivative liabilities\nCredit default swaps $ (9,285) $ — $ 9,285 $ —\nInterest rate swaps (44,514) 9,307 35,207 —\nTotal derivative liabilities $ (53,799) $ 9,307 $ 44,492 $ —\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet Amounts of\nGross Amount of Gross Amounts Assets (Liabilities)\nRecognized Assets Offset in Balance Presented in\n(Liabilities) Sheets Variation Margin Balance Sheets\nDerivative assets\nInterest rate caps $ 6,510 $ — $ — $ 6,510\nInterest rate swaps 13,094 (13,094) — —\nTotal derivative assets $ 19,604 $ (13,094) $ — $ 6,510\nDerivative liabilities\nInterest rate swaps $ (40,541) $ 13,094 $ 27,447 $ —\nTotal derivative liabilities $ (40,541) $ 13,094 $ 27,447 $ —\nThe use of derivatives exposes the Company to counterparty credit risks in the event of a default by a counterparty.

The following table presents a summary of CDO interest rate step-up\nfeatures as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nAdditional\nOutstanding Balance Step-Up Step-Up Date Step-Up Additional Step-Up Date\n$ 194,836 3.00% July 2025 1.00% July 2026\n1.00%, 1.50%, 2.00%, or\n$ 1,222,103 3.00% January 2025 - July 2027 N/A N/A\n(3) The actual maturity of the Company's CDOs are primarily determined by the rate of principal prepayments on the assets of the issuing entity. The CDOs\nare also subject to redemption prior to the stated maturity according to the terms of the respective governing documents. As a result, the actual maturity\nof the CDOs may occur earlier than the stated maturity.\n(4) The Company has elected the fair value option for CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST, residential loan securitizations completed after January 1, 2024\nand a non-Agency RMBS re-securitization (see Note 16). See Note 7 for unrealized gains or losses recognized on CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $19.5 million and $18.0 million in net unrealized losses,\nrespectively, on residential loan securitizations and a non-Agency RMBS re-securitization at fair value, which are included in unrealized gains (losses),\nnet on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n47\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's CDOs as of September 30, 2024 had stated maturities as follows:\nYear ending December 31, Total\n2024 $ —\n2025 —\n2026 —\n2027 107,809\n2028 —\nThereafter 2,755,401\nTotal $ 2,863,210\n48\nTable of Contents\n14. Debt\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOn June 28, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9.125% Senior Notes in an underwritten\npublic offering. The total net proceeds to the Company from the offering of the 9.125% Senior Notes, after deducting the underwriters' discount and commissions\nand offering expenses, were approximately $57.5 million.\nOn April 27, 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale to various qualified institutional investors of $100.0 million aggregate principal\namount of its unregistered 5.75% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"Unregistered Notes\") in a private placement offering at 100% of the principal amount. The net\nproceeds to the Company from the sale of the Unregistered Notes, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $96.3 million. Subsequent to the\nissuance of the Unregistered Notes, the Company conducted an exchange offer wherein the Company exchanged its registered 5.75% Senior Notes due 2026 (the\n\"Registered Notes\" and, together with the aggregate principal amount of Unregistered Notes that remain outstanding, the \"5.75% Senior Notes\") for an equal\nprincipal amount of Unregistered Notes.\nThe 9.125% Senior Notes and the 5.75% Senior Notes (collectively, the \"Senior Unsecured Notes\") are senior unsecured obligations of the Company\nthat are equal in right of payment to each other and structurally subordinated in right of payment to the Company's subordinated debentures. No sinking fund is\nprovided for the Senior Unsecured Notes.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Senior Unsecured Notes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (dollar amounts\nin thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOutstanding Face Outstanding Face\nAmount Carrying Value Amount Carrying Value\n9.125% Senior Notes at fair value $ 60,000 $ 60,900 $ — $ —\n5.75% Senior Notes at amortized cost, net 100,000 98,687 100,000 98,111\nTotal Senior Unsecured Notes $ 160,000 $ 159,587 $ 100,000 $ 98,111\n9.125% Senior Notes\nThe 9.125% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 9.125% per year, payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October\n1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024, and mature on July 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed. The Company may redeem the 9.125% Senior Notes, in\nwhole or in part, at any time at the Company’s option on or after July 1, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount of the\n9.125% Senior Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe Company has elected the fair value option with respect to the 9.125% Senior Notes. None of the change in the fair value of the 9.125% Senior\nNotes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to instrument-specific credit risk. Accordingly, the Company recognized $0.9 million in\nnet unrealized losses on the 9.125% Senior Notes, which are included in unrealized gains (losses), net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements\nof operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n5.75% Senior Notes\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes outstanding. Costs related to the\nissuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes which include underwriting, legal, accounting and other fees, are reflected as deferred charges. The deferred charges, net of\namortization, are presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability on the Company's accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets in the\namount of $1.3 million and $1.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The deferred charges are amortized as an adjustment to\ninterest expense using the effective interest method, resulting in a total cost to the Company of approximately 6.64%.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe 5.75% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year, subject to adjustment from time to time based on changes in the ratings of the 5.75%\nSenior Notes by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (a “NRSRO”). The annual interest rate on the 5.75% Senior Notes will increase\nby (i) 0.50% per year beginning on the first day of any six-month interest period if as of such day the 5.75% Senior Notes have a rating of BB+ or below and\nabove B+ from any NRSRO and (ii) 0.75% per year beginning on the first day of any six-month interest period if as of such day the 5.75% Senior Notes have a\nrating of B+ or below or no rating from any NRSRO. Interest on the 5.75% Senior Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on April 30 and October 30 of each\nyear, and the 5.75% Senior Notes will mature on April 30, 2026.\nThe Company had the right to redeem the 5.75% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to April 30, 2023 at a redemption price equal to\n100% of the principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus the applicable \"make-whole\" premium, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to,\nbut excluding, the redemption date. The \"make-whole\" premium was equal to the present value of all interest that would have accrued between the redemption\ndate and up to, but excluding, April 30, 2023, plus an amount equal to the principal amount of such 5.75% Senior Notes multiplied by 2.875%. After April 30,\n2023, the Company has the right to redeem the 5.75% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of the principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes to be\nredeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus an amount equal to the principal amount of such 5.75% Senior\nNotes multiplied by a date-dependent multiple as detailed in the following table:\nRedemption Period Multiple\nApril 30, 2023 - April 29, 2024 2.875 %\nApril 30, 2024 - April 29, 2025 1.4375 %\nApril 30, 2025 - April 29, 2026 —\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company's 5.75% Senior Notes contain various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum net asset value, ratio\nof unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness and senior debt service coverage ratio and limit the amount of leverage the Company may utilize and its\nability to transfer the Company’s assets substantially as an entirety or merge into or consolidate with another person. The Company is in compliance with such\ncovenants as of September 30, 2024 and through the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSubordinated Debentures\nSubordinated debentures are trust preferred securities that are fully guaranteed by the Company with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon\nliquidation, redemption or repayment. Prior to July 2023, each of the Company's subordinated debentures incurred interest at a floating rate equal to three-month\nLIBOR plus an applicable spread, resetting quarterly. In light of the cessation of the publication of three-month LIBOR after June 30, 2023, and pursuant to the\nterms of each of the Company's subordinated debentures, as of September 30, 2024, the floating rate for each of the Company's subordinated debentures is equal\nto three-month CME Term SOFR plus both a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% per annum and the applicable spread.\nThe following table summarizes the key details of the Company’s subordinated debentures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollar\namounts in thousands):\nNYM Preferred Trust I NYM Preferred Trust II\nPrincipal value of trust preferred securities $ 25,000 $ 20,000\nInterest rate Three-month CME Term SOFR plus tenor Three-month CME Term SOFR plus tenor\nspread adjustment of 0.26161% plus 3.75%, spread adjustment of 0.26161% plus 3.95%,\nresetting quarterly resetting quarterly\nScheduled maturity March 30, 2035 October 30, 2035\nAs of November 1, 2024, the Company has not been notified, and is not aware, of any event of default under the indenture for the subordinated\ndebentures.\n50\nTable of Contents\nMortgages Payable on Real Estate\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company owned joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family apartment\ncommunities, which the Company determined to be VIEs and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company also owned a preferred equity\ninvestment in a VIE that owns a multi-family apartment community and for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company\nconsolidated the respective VIEs into its condensed consolidated financial statements (see Note 7).\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one entity in which the Company holds a joint venture equity investment entered into a debt\nrestructuring agreement with the senior lender for its mortgage payable. As part of the agreement, the required strike price of the interest rate cap agreement\nrelated to the respective mortgage payable increased and a portion of interest payments will be deferred until the maturity date. The restructuring did not result in\na change in the carrying amount of the mortgage payable and no gain was recorded.\nThe consolidated multi-family apartment communities are subject to mortgages payable collateralized by the associated real estate assets. The Company\nhas no obligation for repayment of the mortgages payable but, with respect to certain of the mortgages payable, it may execute a guaranty related to commitment\nof bad acts.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company has established and documented processes for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If\nlisted prices or quotes are not available, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market-based or\nindependently-sourced market parameters, including interest rate yield curves.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for\nthe asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general\nclassification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\na. Residential Loans Held in Consolidated SLST – Residential loans held in Consolidated SLST are carried at fair value and classified as Level 3\nfair values. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 810, the Company determines the fair value of residential loans held in\nConsolidated SLST based on the fair value of the CDOs issued by the respective securitizations and its investment in the securitizations\n(eliminated in consolidation in accordance with GAAP), as the fair value of these instruments is more observable.\nThe investment securities (eliminated in consolidation in accordance with GAAP) that we own in the securitizations are generally illiquid and\ntrade infrequently. As such, they are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair valuation of these investment securities is\ndetermined based on an internal valuation model that considers expected cash flows from the underlying loans and yields required by market\nparticipants. The significant unobservable inputs used in the measurement of these investments are projected losses within the pool of loans\nand a discount rate. The discount rate used in determining fair value incorporates default rate, loss severity, prepayment rate and current market\ninterest rates. Significant increases or decreases in these inputs would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement.\nb. Residential Loans and Residential Loans Held in Securitization Trusts – The Company’s acquired residential loans are recorded at fair value\nand classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value for residential loans is determined using valuations obtained from a third\nparty that specializes in providing valuations of residential loans. The valuation approach depends on whether the residential loan is considered\nperforming, re-performing or non-performing at the date the valuation is performed.\nFor performing and re-performing loans, estimates of fair value are derived using a discounted cash flow model, where estimates of cash flows\nare determined from scheduled payments for each loan, adjusted using forecast prepayment rates, default rates and rates for loss upon default.\nFor non-performing loans, asset liquidation cash flows are derived based on the estimated time to liquidate the loan, expected liquidation costs\nand home price appreciation. Estimated cash flows for both performing and non-performing loans are discounted at yields considered\nappropriate to arrive at a reasonable exit price for the asset. Indications of loan value such as actual trades, bids, offers and generic market color\nmay be used in determining the appropriate discount yield.\nThe Company independently calculates the fair value of residential loans based on discounted cash flows using an internal pricing model to\nvalidate all third party valuations of residential loans. The Company has established thresholds to compare internally generated prices with\nindependent third-party prices and any differences that exceed the thresholds are reviewed both internally and with the third-party pricing\nservice. The Company reconciles and resolves all pricing differences in excess of the thresholds before a final price is established.\n53\nTable of Contents\nc. Preferred Equity and Mezzanine Loan Investments – Fair value for preferred equity and mezzanine loan investments is determined by both\nmarket comparable pricing and discounted cash flows. The discounted cash flows are based on the underlying estimated cash flows and\nestimated changes in market yields. The fair value also reflects consideration of changes in credit risk since origination or time of initial\ninvestment. This fair value measurement is generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, is classified as Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy.\nd. Investment Securities Available for Sale – The Company determines the fair value of its Agency RMBS and non-Agency RMBS based on\ndiscounted cash flows utilizing an internal pricing model. The methodology considers the characteristics of the particular security and its\nunderlying collateral, which are observable inputs. These inputs include, but are not limited to, delinquency status, coupon, loan-to-value\n(\"LTV\"), historical performance, periodic and life caps, collateral type, rate reset period, seasoning, prepayment speeds and credit enhancement\nlevels. The Company also considers several observable market data points, including prices obtained from third-party pricing services or\ndealers who make markets in similar financial instruments, trading activity, and dialogue with market participants. Third-party pricing services\ntypically incorporate commonly used market pricing methods, trading activity observed in the marketplace and other data inputs similar to\nthose used in the Company's internal pricing model. The Company has established thresholds to compare internally generated prices with\nindependent third-party prices and any differences that exceed the thresholds are reviewed both internally and with the third-party pricing\nservice. The Company reconciles and resolves all pricing differences in excess of the thresholds before a final price is established.\nThe Company determines the fair value of its U.S. Treasury securities using a third-party pricing service that compiles prices from various\nsources or using pricing models that consider observable market data to determine the fair value of identical or similar securities.\nThe Company’s investment securities available for sale are valued based upon readily observable market parameters and are classified as Level\n2 fair values.\ne. Equity Investments – Fair value for equity investments is determined (i) by the valuation process for preferred equity and mezzanine loan\ninvestments as described in c. above or (ii) using weighted multiples of origination volume and earnings before taxes, depreciation and\namortization of the entity and the net asset value (\"NAV\") of the equity investment entity. These fair value measurements are generally based\non unobservable inputs and, as such, are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nf. Derivative Instruments – The fair values of the Company's interest rate cap agreements are measured using models developed by either third-\nparty pricing providers or the respective counterparty that use the market-standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash\nreceipts which would occur if floating interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The floating interest rates used in the calculation of\nprojected receipts on the interest rate caps are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate\ncurves and volatilities. The inputs used in the valuation of interest rate caps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company's interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are classified as Level 2 fair values and are measured using valuations reported by\nthe respective central clearing houses. The derivatives are presented net of variation margin payments pledged or received.\nThe Company obtains additional third-party valuations for interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and interest rate cap agreements. The\nCompany has established thresholds to compare different independent third-party prices and any differences that exceed the thresholds are\nreviewed both internally and with the third-party pricing services. The Company reconciles and resolves all pricing differences in excess of the\nthresholds before a final price is established.\n54\nTable of Contents\ng. Collateralized Debt Obligations – CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST are classified as Level 3 fair values for which fair value is determined\nby considering several market data points, including prices obtained from third-party pricing services or dealers who make markets in similar\nfinancial instruments. The third-party pricing service or dealers incorporate common market pricing methods, including a spread measurement\nto the Treasury curve or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security. They will also consider\ncontractual cash payments and yields expected by market participants.\nRefer to a. above for a description of the fair valuation of CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST that are eliminated in consolidation.\nFair value for CDOs issued by the Company's residential loan securitizations and non-Agency RMBS re-securitization is determined by the\nvaluation process for investment securities available for sale as described in d. above and, as such, are classified as Level 2 fair values.\nh. Senior unsecured notes – The Company's 9.125% Senior Notes are valued using pricing models that consider observable market data to\ndetermine the fair value of identical or similar securities and are classified as Level 2 fair values.\nManagement reviews all prices used in determining fair value to ensure they represent current market conditions. This review includes surveying similar\nmarket transactions and comparisons to interest pricing models as well as offerings of like securities by dealers. Any changes to the valuation methodology are\nreviewed by management to ensure the changes are appropriate. As markets and products develop and the pricing for certain products becomes more transparent,\nthe Company continues to refine its valuation methodologies. The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of\nnet realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other\nmarket participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different\nestimate of fair value at the reporting date. The Company uses inputs that are current as of each reporting date, which may include periods of market dislocation,\nduring which time price transparency may be reduced. This condition could cause the Company’s financial instruments to be reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3\nin future periods.\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets (dollar amounts in thousands):\n55\nTable of Contents\nMeasured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis at\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets carried at fair\nvalue\nResidential loans:\nResidential loans $ — $ — $ 700,855 $ 700,855 $ — $ — $ 827,535 $ 827,535\nConsolidated SLST — — 1,008,583 1,008,583 — — 754,860 754,860\nResidential loans held in\nsecuritization trusts — — 2,067,706 2,067,706 — — 1,501,908 1,501,908\nInvestment securities\navailable for sale:\nAgency RMBS — 2,967,966 — 2,967,966 — 1,989,324 — 1,989,324\nNon-Agency RMBS — 68,216 — 68,216 — 24,493 — 24,493\nU.S. Treasury securities — 349,088 — 349,088 — — — —\nMulti-family loans — — 87,614 87,614 — — 95,792 95,792\nEquity investments — — 146,833 146,833 — — 147,116 147,116\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate caps (1) (2) — 1,481 — 1,481 — 6,510 — 6,510\nAssets of disposal group\nheld for sale (3) — 308 — 308 — 2,960 — 2,960\nTotal $ — $ 3,387,059 $ 4,011,591 $ 7,398,650 $ — $ 2,023,287 $ 3,327,211 $ 5,350,498\nLiabilities carried at fair\nvalue\nCDOs:\nConsolidated SLST $ — $ — $ 845,811 $ 845,811 $ — $ — $ 593,737 $ 593,737\nResidential loan\nsecuritizations — 981,779 — 981,779 — — — —\nNon-Agency RMBS re-\nsecuritization — 72,638 — 72,638 — — — —\nSenior unsecured notes — 60,900 — 60,900 — — — —\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps (2) (4) — — — — — — — —\nCredit default swaps (2) (4) — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ 1,115,317 $ 845,811 $ 1,961,128 $ — $ — $ 593,737 $ 593,737\n(1) Excludes assets of disposal group held for sale (see Note 9).\n(2) Included in other assets or other liabilities, respectively, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) Includes interest rate caps classified as Level 2 instruments in the amount of $0.3 million and $3.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\n56\nTable of Contents\n(4) All of the Company’s interest rate swaps and credit default swaps are cleared through central clearing houses.

In addition, certain material and adverse changes to the terms of any series of the Preferred Stock cannot be made\nwithout the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the series of Preferred Stock whose terms are being changed.\nThe Preferred Stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless\nrepurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted into the Company’s common stock in connection with a change of control.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, each holder of Preferred Stock will have the right (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem the\nPreferred Stock) to convert some or all of the Preferred Stock held by such holder into a number of shares of our common stock per share of the applicable series\nof Preferred Stock determined by a formula, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the applicable Articles Supplementary for such\nseries.\n66\nTable of Contents\n(b) Dividends on Preferred Stock\nThe following table presents the relevant information with respect to quarterly cash dividends declared on the Preferred Stock commencing January 1,\n2023 through September 30, 2024:\nCash Dividend Per Share\nSeries D Series E Series F Series G\nPreferred Preferred Preferred Preferred\nDeclaration Date Record Date Payment Date Stock Stock Stock Stock\nSeptember 19, 2024 October 1, 2024 October 15, 2024 $ 0.50 $ 0.4921875 $ 0.4296875 $ 0.43750\nJune 18, 2024 July 1, 2024 July 15, 2024 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\nMarch 13, 2024 April 1, 2024 April 15, 2024 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\nDecember 14, 2023 January 1, 2024 January 15, 2024 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\nSeptember 11, 2023 October 1, 2023 October 15, 2023 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\nJune 6, 2023 July 1, 2023 July 15, 2023 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\nMarch 9, 2023 April 1, 2023 April 15, 2023 0.50 0.4921875 0.4296875 0.43750\n(c) Common Stock\nThe Company had 200,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, with 90,579,449 and 90,675,403 shares issued and\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOn February 22, 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split.

In connection with the reverse stock split,\nthe number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock was also reduced on a one-for-four basis, from 800,000,000 to 200,000,000. The par value of\neach share of common stock remained unchanged. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, each stockholder holding\nfractional shares as a result of the Reverse Stock Split was entitled to receive, in lieu of such fractional shares, cash in an amount based on the closing price of the\nCompany's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 8, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split applied to all of the Company’s outstanding shares of\ncommon stock and therefore did not affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of shares of the Company’s common stock, except for de minimis changes\nresulting from the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. All common share and per common share data included in these condensed consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto have been adjusted on a retroactive basis to reflect the impact of the Reverse Stock Split.\nIn February 2022, the Board of Directors approved a $200.0 million common stock repurchase program.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share\nThe Company calculates basic earnings (loss) per common share by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the Company's common stockholders for\nthe period by weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for that period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share takes into account the effect of\ndilutive instruments, such as performance share units (\"PSUs\"), restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), deferred stock units (\"DSUs\") and the number of incremental\nshares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain of the RSUs and DSUs awarded under the 2017 Plan were determined to be dilutive and\nwere included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share under the treasury stock method. Under this method, common equivalent shares are\ncalculated assuming that outstanding RSUs and DSUs vest according to the respective RSU and DSU agreements and unrecognized compensation cost is used to\nrepurchase shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock at the average market price during the reported period. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the RSUs and DSUs awarded under the 2017 Plan were determined to be anti-dilutive and were not included in the calculation of diluted\nloss per common share.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the PSUs awarded under the 2017 Plan were determined to be anti-dilutive and were not\nincluded in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the PSUs and RSUs awarded under the 2017 Plan were determined to be anti-dilutive and\nwere not included in the calculation of diluted loss per common share.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for the periods indicated (dollar and share amounts\nin thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic Earnings (Loss) per Common Share:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company $ 42,849 $ (84,509) $ (30,640) $ (90,573)\nLess: Preferred Stock dividends (10,439) (10,435) (31,317) (31,394)\nPlus: Gain on repurchase of Preferred Stock — 125 — 467\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 32,410 $ (94,819) $ (61,957) $ (121,500)\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 90,582 90,984 90,895 91,163\nBasic Earnings (Loss) per Common Share $ 0.36 $ (1.04) $ (0.68) $ (1.33)\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share:\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company $ 42,849 $ (84,509) $ (30,640) $ (90,573)\nLess: Preferred Stock dividends (10,439) (10,435) (31,317) (31,394)\nPlus: Gain on repurchase of Preferred Stock — 125 — 467\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 32,410 $ (94,819) $ (61,957) $ (121,500)\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 90,582 90,984 90,895 91,163\nNet effect of assumed RSUs and DSUs vested 4 — — —\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 90,586 90,984 90,895 91,163\nDiluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share $ 0.36 $ (1.04) $ (0.68) $ (1.33)\n69\nTable of Contents\n19.

Our objective is to deliver long-term stable distributions to our stockholders over changing\neconomic conditions through a combination of net interest spread and capital gains from a diversified investment portfolio. Our current investment portfolio\nincludes credit sensitive single-family and multi-family assets, as well as more traditional types of fixed-income investments that provide coupon income, such as\nAgency RMBS.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and have complied, and intend to continue to comply, with the provisions of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), with respect thereto. Accordingly, we do not expect to be subject to federal\nincome tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders if certain asset, income, distribution and ownership tests and record\nkeeping requirements are fulfilled. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we expect to be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on income\ngenerated in our TRSs.\nExecutive Summary\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2023, after significantly curtailing our investment activity and pipeline in 2022 in anticipation of a recession to\nconserve capital, preserve liquidity and limit what we believed was material credit risk from investments underwritten to peak real estate valuations in 2022, we\nbegan stabilizing our investment portfolio holdings through greater investment activity. Since that time, we have focused, in large part, on acquiring assets with\nless price sensitivity to credit deterioration that could expand our interest income levels, like Agency RMBS. We believe that Agency RMBS is a compelling\nasset class to invest in over the near term, as the sector is trading at historically wide spread levels resulting from volatility in interest rates and reduced demand\nfrom regional banks and the Federal Reserve. Recognizing that a recession call was premature, but still concerned about market liquidity due to, among other\nthings, growing commercial real estate risks, we also remained selective in adding credit-related assets in our portfolio. Specifically, we have targeted low\nduration, high-coupon business purpose loans while remaining selective on credit profile and worked to optimize financing of the loans we acquire. During this\ntime, we continued to drive higher business purpose loan acquisition volumes through ongoing partnerships with numerous originators. Over the course of the\npast six quarters, we have experienced solid momentum in our portfolio acquisition activities and increased adjusted interest income, a supplemental non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, by more than 70% as compared to the same period last year. On a net basis, our investment portfolio increased by approximately $3.1 billion\nbetween December 31, 2022 and September 30, 2024, with repayments received from our short-duration business purpose loans, opportunistic sales of\nresidential loans and investment securities, redemptions of our mezzanine lending investments, return of capital from our joint venture equity investments, and\nimpairments offsetting some of our investment activity.\nIn September 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a strategic repositioning of our business through the opportunistic disposition\nover time of our joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties and reallocation of the returned capital from such investments to our targeted assets.\nIn 2023, joint venture entities in which we held a common equity interest sold five multi-family properties, representing total net equity investments of $43.2\nmillion and recognizing a net gain attributable to the Company totaling $1.7 million. Throughout most of 2023 and continuing into 2024, certain of the multi-\nfamily properties held by our joint venture equity investments experienced declines in estimated fair value primarily due to widening cap rates and lower net\noperating income driven, in large part, by higher interest and operating expenses at the properties which resulted in significant impairment losses. We have exited\nseven additional joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties year to date, received net proceeds of $21.8 million and realized $12.4 million of net\ngains attributable to us. As of September 30, 2024, we continue to market for sale our joint venture equity investments in four multi-family properties. We can\nprovide no assurance of the timing or success of our ultimate exit from our joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties or that the value of our\ninterests in joint ventures will not decline further.\n83\nTable of Contents\nWe intend to focus on our core portfolio strengths of single-family and multi-family residential assets, which we believe will deliver better risk adjusted\nreturns over time. Our targeted investments include (i) residential loans, including business purpose loans, (ii) Agency RMBS, (iii) non-Agency RMBS, (iv)\nstructured multi-family property investments such as preferred equity in, and mezzanine loans to, owners of multi-family properties, (v) CMBS and (vi) certain\nother mortgage-, residential housing- and credit-related assets and strategic investments in companies from which we purchase, or may in the future purchase,\nour targeted assets. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and the maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under\nthe Investment Company Act, we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage-, residential housing- and other credit-related\nor alternative investments that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them, including, without limitation, collateralized\nmortgage obligations, mortgage servicing rights, excess mortgage servicing spreads, securities issued by newly originated securitizations, including credit\nsensitive securities from these securitizations, ABS and debt or equity investments in alternative assets or businesses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s Recourse Leverage Ratio and Portfolio Recourse Leverage Ratio (as defined in footnotes 4 and 5 to the table\nunder \"— Capital Allocation\") increased to 2.6x and 2.5x, respectively, from 1.6x and 1.5x, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, primarily due to the financing\nof highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities and Agency RMBS. As of September 30, 2024, 62% of our debt, excluding mortgages payable on real estate and\nConsolidated SLST CDOs, is subject to mark-to-market margin calls, with 46% of that debt collateralized by Agency RMBS, 6% collateralized by U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and 10% collateralized by residential credit assets. The remaining 38% has no exposure to collateral repricing by our counterparties. Although we\nexpect our leverage to continue to move higher as we access additional liquidity and grow our investment portfolio further, we intend to continue to focus on\nprocuring longer-term and non-mark-to-market financing arrangements for certain parts of our credit portfolio. We believe that this will allow us to better\nmanage our liquidity risk and better insulate our business from extreme market dislocations. To this end, we completed a non-Agency RMBS re-securitization\nand four new, non-recourse securitizations of residential loans and redeemed two existing residential loan securitizations during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. We also completed the issuance of $60.0 million of our 9.125% Senior Notes due 2029 in an underwritten public offering in the second\nquarter of 2024. We received $57.5 million in net proceeds from the issuance and utilized the proceeds to purchase Agency RMBS.\nWe expect to continue to opportunistically dispose of assets from our portfolio, including our joint venture equity investments, and generate higher\nportfolio turnover in order to pursue investments across the residential housing sector with a focus on acquiring assets capable of growing our interest income.\nWe expect to remain selective in acquiring single-family and multi-family residential credit assets and remain committed to prudently managing our liabilities.\nOur investment and capital allocation decisions depend on prevailing market conditions, among other factors, and may change over time in response to\nopportunities available in different economic and capital market environments.\n84\nTable of Contents\nCurrent Market Conditions and Commentary\nThe results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other\nthings, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets, which is driven by numerous factors including changes in interest rates and the supply\nand demand for mortgage, housing and credit assets in the marketplace, our ability to identify and acquire assets on favorable terms, our ability to dispose of\nassets from time to time on favorable terms, the ability of our operating partners, tenants and borrowers of our loans and those that underlie our investment\nsecurities to meet their payment obligations, the terms and availability of adequate financing and capital, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a\nnational and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate, mortgage, credit and financial markets, and the credit performance of our credit\nsensitive assets.\nFinancial and mortgage-related markets experienced strong positive performance during the third quarter of 2024, spurred in part by the Federal\nReserve’s first cut to the target range for the federal funds rate in approximately four and a half years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the third\nquarter of 2024 up 8.21% and grew 12.31% over the first nine months of 2024, closing off the third quarter at a then all‑time high. However, interest rate and\nmonetary policy uncertainty, inflation and geopolitical instability have cautioned some economic outlooks. We anticipate that due to uncertainty related to\ninflation, interest rates, monetary policy, the imminent U.S. presidential election and upcoming change in U.S. presidential administration in January 2025,\nmarkets and the pricing for many of our assets will continue to experience volatility in the remainder of 2024.\nThe market conditions discussed below significantly influence our investment strategy and results:\nSelect U.S. Financial and Economic Data. The U.S. economy grew modestly in the third quarter of 2024 with real gross domestic product (“GDP”)\nincreasing by 2.8% (advanced estimate) annualized rate, as compared to the annualized 3.0% GDP growth in the second quarter of 2024 and annualized 1.6%\nGDP growth in the first quarter of 2024. The third quarter 2024 GDP increase marks ten straight quarters of GDP growth. While GDP growth continued in the\nfirst nine months of 2024, inflation remains persistently above the Federal Reserve’s target of two percent and job growth remains robust, uncertainty about how\nthe Federal Reserve may adjust its monetary policy or the target range for the federal funds rate in response to such macroeconomic trends may limit or\nundermine business activity and the potential for future GDP growth, which could negatively impact the value of credit investments.\nAfter moderating in the first half of 2024, the U.S. labor market tightened during the third quarter of 2024 in contrast to many market commentators’\nexpectations. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1% at the end of September 2024, finishing flat to the\nunemployment rate of 4.1% as of the end of June 2024 and standing in contrast to the general trend of unemployment rate growth seen in the first six months of\n2024. The number of unemployed persons increased by 0.5 million year-over-year to 6.8 million as of September 2024. There continues to be a wide disparity\nbetween the number of available job openings, 8.0 million as of the end of August 2024, and the number of unemployed persons, resulting in a competitive labor\nmarket and rising wages. As of September 2024, average hourly earnings for all employees on non-farm payrolls rose 4.0% year-over-year.\nAfter raising the target range for the federal funds rate a total of 5.25% in 2022 and 2023, bringing the range to its highest level in over 22 years, and\nholding the range at that target for 14 months, the Federal Reserve cut the target range by 50 basis points in September 2024, the first such cut since March 2020.\nIn September 2024, the Federal Reserve announced the 50 basis points rate cut after acknowledging that inflation appears to be moving sustainably toward the\nFederal Reserve’s target of two percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve stated that it will\ncarefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and\ninflation at the rate of two percent over the longer run. Changing expectations with respect to the Federal Reserve’s actions regarding the target range for the\nfederal funds rate after quarter end contributed to an uncertain interest rate environment. Higher interest rates tend to put pressure on our investments, mortgage\nborrowers, tenants, our operating partners and economic growth generally.\nThe fears of an economic recession in the U.S. that were prevalent last year have receded in connection with the consistent U.S. GDP growth seen in\n2024, although some economists and market commentators have expressed lower expectations for U.S. GDP growth in 2025. The National Bureau of Economic\nResearch defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” An\neconomic recession or stagnating economic growth may put pressure on the ability of our operating partners, joint ventures, tenants and borrowers to meet their\nobligations to us, and would likely adversely impact the value of our assets, among other things, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n85\nTable of Contents\nSingle-Family Homes and Residential Mortgage Market. Over the first nine months of 2024, the residential real estate market remained competitive for\nhome buyers. Data released by the S&P Dow Jones Indices for their S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price NSA Indices for July 2024 showed that,\non average, home prices increased 5.9% for the 20-City Composite over July 2024. Additionally, according to the National Association of Realtors (“NAR”),\nexisting home sales in August 2024 were down 2.5% month-over-month and 4.2% year-over-year. NAR also reported that the median existing-home sales price\nfor all housing types in August 2024 was $416,700, up 3.1% from $404,200 in August 2023. According to data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, privately-owned housing starts for single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 962,667\nand 1,009,556 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 948,500 for the year ended December 31, 2023. Overall,\nexisting home inventory for sale at the end of August 2024 amounted to 4.2 months of supply, up from 4.1 months of supply in July 2024 and 3.3 months of\nsupply in August 2023, according to the NAR. According to Freddie Mac, the weekly average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was down 1.25% year-over-year to\n6.32% as of October 10, 2024. Declining single-family housing fundamentals may adversely impact the overall credit profile and value of our existing portfolio\nof single-family residential credit investments and the value of our single-family rental properties, as well as the availability of certain of our targeted assets.\nRental Housing. According to data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, starts on multi-\nfamily homes containing five or more units averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 341,667 and 331,889 for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 459,417 for the year ended December 31, 2023. According to RealPage Analytics, rents for professionally managed\napartments grew modestly in the third quarter of 2024 with rents growing 30 basis points in July, 40 basis points in August and 20 basis points in September,\neach as compared to the same period year-over-year. The CoStar Group notes that, while apartment demand remains high, asking rents were likely dampened by\nthe increased supply from the completion of approximately 178,000 apartment units in the third quarter of 2024 and that rents will likely continue to be\ndampened in the immediate term by the expected completion of approximately 636,000 new apartment units total in the full year 2024, which the CoStar Group\nnotes would amount to the most units delivered in a single year in four decades. Weakening multi-family housing fundamentals, including, among other things,\nincreasing supply of apartments and declining rents in the markets or submarkets in which we invest, increasing interest rates, widening capitalization rates and\nreduced liquidity for owners of multi-family properties, may cause our operating partners to fail to meet their obligations to us and/or contribute to reduced cash\nflows from and/or valuation declines for multi-family properties, and in turn, many of the multi-family investments that we own.\nAdditionally, multi-family investments face growing regulatory and political headwinds. In January 2023, the White House Domestic Policy Council\nand National Economic Council released a white paper entitled the “Blueprint for a Renters Bill of Rights” (the “Blueprint”). The Blueprint discusses potential\ntenant protections regarding leasing and management of rental properties, tenant organizing, evictions and rent increases, among other potential protections.\nAlthough the Blueprint is non-binding, several federal agencies, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment, have announced actions that seek to further some of the principles set forth in the Blueprint. In July 2023, President Biden announced an initiative\nto promote the disclosure and reduction of rental housing fees such as application fees, payment fees, and other mandatory fees. Further, in August 2023, the\nWhite House announced a series of initiatives to build on the Blueprint such as providing funding to support tenant organizing efforts. In July 2024, the White\nHouse also called on the U.S. Congress to pass a form of nationwide rent control that would place a cap on yearly rent increases. Policies, regulations or laws\nimplemented to further the principles discussed in the Blueprint, reduce or limit fees or limit rent increases could lead to increased costs, decreased revenue and\nreduced operational flexibility for multi-family and single-family rental properties, which could contribute to reduced cash flows from and/or valuation declines\nfor multi-family and single-family rental properties, and in turn, many of the multi-family investments and single-family rentals that we own.\nCredit Spreads. Investment grade and high-yield credit spreads experienced volatility in August 2024 as markets reacted to, among other factors, a\nbelow-expectation July 2024 employment report and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve’s actions with respect to the target range for the federal funds rate.\nUltimately, both investment grade and high-yield credit spreads experienced modest tightening at the end of the third quarter of 2024 with investment grade\nspreads finishing 4 basis points lower than the start of the third quarter of 2024 and high-yield spreads finishing 18 basis points lower than the start of the third\nquarter of 2024. Tightening credit spreads generally increase the value of many of our credit sensitive assets, while widening credit spreads tend to have a\nnegative impact on the value of many of our credit sensitive assets.\n86\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Markets. For the first time since June 2022, the Treasury curve uninverted at the end of August 2024 marking the end of the longest inverted\nTreasury curve on record. This normalization of the Treasury curve was driven in part by investors’ expectations of the Federal Reserve’s cuts to the target range\nfor the federal funds rate. Inversions and subsequent normalizations of this spread are generally considered to be indicators of a recession in the near term,\nalthough some market commentators have cautioned against August 2024’s uninversion being such an indicator. On September 30, 2024, the spread between the\n2-Year U.S. Treasury yield and the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield closed at 15 basis points, as compared to a negative 35 basis point spread on December 29, 2023.\nThis spread is important as it is indicative of opportunities for investing in levered assets. Increases in interest rates raise the costs of many of our liabilities,\nwhile overall interest rate volatility generally increases the costs of hedging and may place downward pressure on some of our strategies.\nMonetary Policy and Recent Regulatory Developments. The Federal Reserve took a number of actions to stabilize markets during the COVID-19\npandemic. From March 2020 until March 2022, the Federal Reserve implemented an asset purchase program aimed at providing liquidity to the U.S. Treasury\nand Agency RMBS markets. Under the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet grew from about $4.2 trillion in assets at\nthe start of March 2020 to about $8.9 trillion in assets at the end of the program in March 2022. On June 1, 2022, the Federal Reserve shifted course and began\nshrinking its balance sheet by reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasuries and Agency RMBS by $47.5 billion per month. In September 2022, the Federal Reserve\nincreased its efforts to reduce its balance sheet by doubling the amount of U.S. Treasuries and Agency RMBS it rolls off its balance sheet to $95 billion each\nmonth. On June 1, 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced from $60 billion to $25 billion the amount of U.S. Treasuries it rolls off its balance sheet each month while\ncontinuing to reduce its holdings of Agency RMBS by $35 billion per month. As of October 7, 2024, the Federal Reserve held about $7.05 trillion in assets. Sales\nor reductions in the pace of purchasing of Agency RMBS by the Federal Reserve could create headwinds in the market for Agency RMBS where increased\nsupply could drive prices lower and interest rates higher.\nFrom March 2020 to March 2022, the Federal Reserve maintained a target range for the federal funds rate of 0% to 0.25% in view of the COVID-19\npandemic and to foster maximum employment and price stability. Then, from March 2022 through July 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the federal funds\nrate eleven times to bring the target range for the federal funds rate to 5.25% to 5.50% where it remained until September 19, 2024 when the Federal Reserve\nimplemented a 50 basis point cut to the target range. When announcing the 50 basis point rate cut in September 2024, the Federal Reserve stated that inflation\nhad made progress toward the Federal Reserve’s objective of achieving an inflation rate of two percent over the longer run and that, in light of this progress on\ninflation and considering the risks to the Federal Reserve’s second objective of achieving maximum employment, a cut to the target range was appropriate. The\nFederal Reserve further noted in its September 2024 statement that any future cuts to the target range for the federal funds rate will depend on a careful\nassessment of incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks to its dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and an inflation rate of two\npercent. As reflected on the “dot plot” included in the projection materials from the Federal Reserve’s September 2024 meeting, most Federal Reserve officials\nindicated that an additional 25 or 50 basis point cut to the target range for the federal funds rate by the end of 2024 would be appropriate. However, recent\neconomic data since the Federal Reserve’s September 2024 meeting showing strong job growth, among other data points, along with the Federal Reserve’s\nSeptember 2024 statement emphasizing the consideration that will be given to evolving economic data has cautioned some market commentators’ expectations of\nfurther cuts to the target range for the federal funds rate in 2024.\nThe scope and nature of the actions the Federal Reserve and other governmental authorities will ultimately undertake are unknown and will continue to\nevolve. There can be no assurance as to how, in the long term, these and other actions, as well as the negative impacts from ongoing geopolitical instability and\nuncertainty surrounding inflation, interest rates and the outlook for the U.S. and global economies, will affect the efficiency, liquidity and stability of the\nfinancial, credit and mortgage markets, and thus, our business. Greater uncertainty frequently leads to wider asset spreads or lower prices and higher hedging\ncosts.\n87\nTable of Contents\nThird Quarter 2024 Summary\nEarnings and Return Metrics\nThe following table presents key earnings and return metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands,\nexcept per share data):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 32,410 $ (61,957)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders per share (basic) $ 0.36 $ (0.68)\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) (1) $ 34,941 $ (54,372)\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) per common share (1) $ 0.39 $ (0.60)\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders $ 32,410 $ (61,953)\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders per share\n(basic) $ 0.36 $ (0.68)\nYield on average interest earning assets (1) (2) 6.69 % 6.52 %\nInterest income $ 108,361 $ 283,027\nInterest expense $ 88,124 $ 225,883\nNet interest income $ 20,237 $ 57,144\nNet interest spread (1) (3) 1.32 % 1.31 %\nBook value per common share at the end of the period $ 9.83 $ 9.83\nAdjusted book value per common share at the end of the period (1) $ 10.87 $ 10.87\nEconomic return on book value (4) 3.51 % (7.78)%\nEconomic return on adjusted book value (5) 0.45 % (9.40)%\nDividends per common share $ 0.20 $ 0.60\n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Our management team believes that these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provide supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current\nperformance and trends using the metrics that management uses to operate our business. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with\nGAAP, they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results\nand the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the most directly comparable financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) and Net Interest Spread\nFinancial results for the Company during a given period include the net interest income earned on our investment portfolio of residential loans,\ninvestment securities and preferred equity investments and mezzanine loans, where the risks and payment characteristics are equivalent to and accounted for as\nloans (collectively, our “interest earning assets”). Adjusted net interest income (loss) and net interest spread (both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures)\nare impacted by factors such as our cost of financing, including our hedging costs, and the interest rate that our investments bear. Furthermore, the amount of\npremium or discount paid on purchased investments and the prepayment rates on investments will impact adjusted net interest income (loss) as such factors will\nbe amortized over the expected term of such investments.\nWe provide the following non-GAAP financial measures, in total and by investment category, for the respective periods:\n• adjusted interest income – calculated as our GAAP interest income reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs,\n• adjusted interest expense – calculated as our GAAP interest expense reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs and\nadjusted to include the net interest component of interest rate swaps,\n• adjusted net interest income (loss) – calculated by subtracting adjusted interest expense from adjusted interest income,\n• yield on average interest earning assets – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our average interest earning assets and\nexcludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company,\n• average financing cost – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest expense and the average outstanding balance of our interest bearing\nliabilities, excluding Consolidated SLST CDOs and mortgages payable on real estate, and\n• net interest spread – calculated as the difference between our yield on average interest earning assets and our average financing cost.\nThese measures remove the impact of Consolidated SLST that we consolidate in accordance with GAAP and include the net interest component of\ninterest rate swaps utilized to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings, which is included in (losses) gains on derivative\ninstruments, net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. With respect to Consolidated SLST, we only include the interest income\nearned by the Consolidated SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company as the Company only receives income or absorbs losses related to the\nConsolidated SLST securities actually owned by the Company. We include the net interest component of interest rate swaps in these measures to more fully\nrepresent the cost of our financing strategy.\nWe provide the non-GAAP financial measures listed above because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management\nwith additional detail and enhance their understanding of our interest earning asset yields, in total and by investment category, relative to the cost of our financing\nand the underlying trends within our portfolio of interest earning assets. In addition to the foregoing, our management team uses these measures to assess, among\nother things, the performance of our interest earning assets in total and by asset, possible cash flows from our interest earning assets in total and by asset, our\nability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing and the composition of our portfolio of interest earning assets, including acquisition\nand disposition determinations.\n101\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables set forth certain information about our interest earning assets by category and their related adjusted interest income, adjusted\ninterest expense, adjusted net interest income (loss), yield on average interest earning assets, average financing cost and net interest spread for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nMulti-\nSingle-Family (8) Family Corporate/Other Total\nAdjusted Interest Income (1) (2) $ 97,233 $ 2,699 $ 1,054 $ 100,986\nAdjusted Interest Expense (1) (66,297) — (5,999) (72,296)\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) (1) $ 30,936 $ 2,699 $ (4,945) $ 28,690\nAverage Interest Earning Assets (3) $ 5,841,444 $ 91,164 $ 103,275 $ 6,035,883\nAverage Interest Bearing Liabilities (4) $ 4,976,522 $ — $ 379,590 $ 5,356,112\nYield on Average Interest Earning Assets (1) (5) 6.66 % 11.84 % 4.08 % 6.69 %\nAverage Financing Cost (1) (6) (5.30)% — (6.29)% (5.37)%\nNet Interest Spread (1) (7) 1.36 % 11.84 % (2.21)% 1.32 %\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nMulti-\nSingle-Family (8) Family Corporate/Other Total\nAdjusted Interest Income (1) (2) $ 55,389 $ 3,849 $ — $ 59,238\nAdjusted Interest Expense (1) (35,150) — (3,433) (38,583)\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) (1) $ 20,239 $ 3,849 $ (3,433) $ 20,655\nAverage Interest Earning Assets (3) $ 3,801,646 $ 127,909 $ 1,000 $ 3,930,555\nAverage Interest Bearing Liabilities (4) $ 2,764,496 $ — $ 221,534 $ 2,986,030\nYield on Average Interest Earning Assets (1) (5) 5.83 % 11.94 % — 6.03 %\nAverage Financing Cost (1) (6) (5.04)% — (6.15)% (5.13)%\nNet Interest Spread (1) (7) 0.79 % 11.94 % (6.15)% 0.90 %\n102\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nMulti-\nSingle-Family (8) Family Corporate/Other Total\nAdjusted Interest Income (1) (2) $ 253,966 $ 8,072 $ 1,061 $ 263,099\nAdjusted Interest Expense (1) (168,109) — (12,771) (180,880)\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) (1) $ 85,857 $ 8,072 $ (11,710) $ 82,219\nAverage Interest Earning Assets (3) $ 5,248,626 $ 94,306 $ 34,425 $ 5,377,357\nAverage Interest Bearing Liabilities (4) $ 4,368,101 $ — $ 273,195 $ 4,641,296\nYield on Average Interest Earning Assets (1) (5) 6.45 % 11.41 % 4.11 % 6.52 %\nAverage Financing Cost (1) (6) (5.14)% — (6.24)% (5.21)%\nNet Interest Spread (1) (7) 1.31 % 11.41 % (2.13)% 1.31 %\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nMulti-\nSingle-Family (8) Family Corporate/Other Total\nAdjusted Interest Income (1) (2) $ 150,535 $ 11,036 $ 62 $ 161,633\nAdjusted Interest Expense (1) (97,224) — (9,287) (106,511)\nAdjusted Net Interest Income (Loss) (1) $ 53,311 $ 11,036 $ (9,225) $ 55,122\nAverage Interest Earning Assets (3) $ 3,399,554 $ 127,746 $ 1,352 $ 3,528,652\nAverage Interest Bearing Liabilities (4) $ 2,406,727 $ — $ 190,736 $ 2,597,463\nYield on Average Interest Earning Assets (1) (5) 5.90 % 11.52 % 6.12 % 6.11 %\nAverage Financing Cost (1) (6) (5.40)% — (6.51)% (5.48)%\nNet Interest Spread (1) (7) 0.50 % 11.52 % (0.39)% 0.63 %\n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.\n(2) Includes interest income earned on cash accounts held by the Company.\n(3) Average Interest Earning Assets for the respective periods include residential loans, multi-family loans and investment securities and exclude all\nConsolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company.

Our GAAP interest income includes interest income recognized on the underlying seasoned re-performing\nand non-performing residential loans held in Consolidated SLST. Our GAAP interest expense includes interest expense recognized on the Consolidated\nSLST CDOs that permanently finance the residential loans in Consolidated SLST and are not owned by the Company. We calculate adjusted interest\nincome by reducing our GAAP interest income by the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted interest expense by\nexcluding, among other things, the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs, thus only including the interest income earned by the\nSLST securities that are actually owned by the Company in adjusted net interest income.\nFor the three- and nine- month periods, adjusted interest income increased by approximately $41.7 million and $101.5 million, respectively, primarily\ndue to an increase in interest earnings assets driven by increased investment in Agency RMBS since September 30, 2023.

By excluding these non-cash adjustments from our operating results, we believe that the presentation of\nundepreciated earnings (loss) provides a consistent measure of our operating performance and useful information to investors to evaluate the effective net return\non our portfolio. In addition, we believe that presenting undepreciated earnings (loss) enables our investors to measure, evaluate, and compare our operating\nperformance to that of our peers.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders to undepreciated earnings (loss) for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common\nstockholders $ 32,410 $ (94,819) $ (61,957) $ (121,500)\nAdd:\nDepreciation expense on operating real estate 2,531 2,182 7,585 6,482\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) $ 34,941 $ (92,637) $ (54,372) $ (115,018)\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 90,582 90,984 90,895 91,163\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) per common share $ 0.39 $ (1.02) $ (0.60) $ (1.26)\n105\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Book Value Per Common Share\nAdjusted book value per common share is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by making the following adjustments to GAAP book\nvalue: (i) exclude the Company's share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period\nfor which an impairment has not been recognized, (ii) exclude the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value\nand (iii) adjust our amortized cost liabilities that finance our investment portfolio to fair value.\nOur rental property portfolio includes fee simple interests in single-family rental homes and joint venture equity interests in multi-family properties\nowned by Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. By excluding our share of cumulative non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses related to real estate held at the\nend of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, adjusted book value reflects the value, at their undepreciated basis, of our single-family\nrental properties and joint venture equity investments that the Company has determined to be recoverable at the end of the period.\nAdditionally, in connection with third party ownership of certain of the non-controlling interests in certain of the Consolidated Real Estate VIEs, we\nrecord redeemable non-controlling interests as mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling\ninterests may elect to sell their ownership interests to us at fair value once a year, subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, resulting in an\nadjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value that is accounted for by us as an equity transaction in accordance with GAAP. A key\ncomponent of the estimation of fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests is the estimated fair value of the multi-family apartment properties held by\nthe applicable Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. However, because the corresponding real estate assets are not reported at fair value and thus not adjusted to reflect\nunrealized gains or losses in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the cumulative adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value\ndirectly affects our GAAP book value. By excluding the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value, adjusted\nbook value more closely aligns the accounting treatment applied to these real estate assets and reflects our joint venture equity investment at its undepreciated\nbasis.\nThe substantial majority of our remaining assets are financial or similar instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option\nin our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, unlike our use of the fair value option for the assets in our investment portfolio, certain CDOs\nissued by our residential loan securitizations, certain senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures that finance our investment portfolio assets are carried\nat amortized cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. By adjusting these financing instruments to fair value, adjusted book value reflects the\nCompany's net equity in investments on a comparable fair value basis.\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted book value per common share provides a useful measure for investors and us as it provides a consistent\nmeasure of our value, allows management to effectively consider our financial position and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to that of our\npeers.\n106\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of GAAP book value to adjusted book value and calculation of adjusted book value per common share as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCompany's stockholders' equity $ 1,444,147 $ 1,579,612\nPreferred stock liquidation preference (554,110) (554,110)\nGAAP book value 890,037 1,025,502\nAdd:\nCumulative depreciation expense on real estate (1) 19,180 21,801\nCumulative amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate (1) 4,903 14,897\nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value 48,282 30,062\nAdjustment of amortized cost liabilities to fair value 21,961 55,271\nAdjusted book value $ 984,363 $ 1,147,533\nCommon shares outstanding 90,579 90,675\nGAAP book value per common share (2) $ 9.83 $ 11.31\nAdjusted book value per common share (3) $ 10.87 $ 12.66\n(1) Represents cumulative adjustments for the Company's share of depreciation expense and amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate held as\nof the end of the period presented for which an impairment has not been recognized.\n(2) GAAP book value per common share is calculated using the GAAP book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.\n(3) Adjusted book value per common share is calculated using the adjusted book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.\n107\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based, in part, on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe\nare reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions utilized in the\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Although our estimates contemplate conditions as of September 30, 2024 and\nhow we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could\nmaterially affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at the date of the consolidated financial statements\nand the reported amounts of income, expenses and other comprehensive income (loss) during the periods presented.\nChanges in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these consolidated financial statements.

The CDOs\nare also subject to redemption prior to the stated maturity according to the terms of the respective governing documents. As a result, the actual maturity\nof the CDOs may occur earlier than the stated maturity.\n(4) The Company has elected the fair value option for CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST and residential loan securitizations completed after January 1,\n2024 (see Note 16). See Note 7 for unrealized gains or losses recognized on CDOs issued by Consolidated SLST. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company recognized $18.8 million and $17.3 million in net unrealized losses, respectively, on residential loan securitizations\nat fair value, which are included in unrealized gains (losses), net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n(5) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company invested in subordinated securities issued by a Freddie Mac-sponsored residential loan\nsecuritization, resulting in the initial consolidation of $285.1 million of residential loans and $275.2 million of CDOs in the VIE.\n115\nTable of Contents\nInvestment Securities\nAt September 30, 2024, our investment securities portfolio included Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS and U.S. Treasury securities, which are\nclassified as investment securities available for sale.

At September 30, 2024, we had no investment securities in a single issuer or entity that had an aggregate book value in excess of 5% of our\ntotal assets. The increase in the carrying value of our investment securities as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023 is primarily due to\npurchases of Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS and U.S. Treasury securities and an increase in the fair value of a number of our investment securities during\nthe period.\nThe following tables summarize our investment securities portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nUnrealized Weighted Average\nOutstanding\nCurrent Par Amortized Repurchase\nInvestment Securities Value Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Coupon (1) Yield (2) Agreements\nAvailable for Sale\n(“AFS”)\nAgency RMBS\nFixed rate $ 2,699,210 $ 2,705,816 $ 49,119 $ (215) $ 2,754,720 5.86 % 5.76 % $ 2,461,995\nAdjustable rate 136,998 135,430 2,892 — 138,322 5.47 % 5.51 % 131,752\nIO 1,302,584 85,357 2,526 (12,959) 74,924 0.78 % 12.54 % 44,713\nTotal Agency\nRMBS 4,138,792 2,926,603 54,537 (13,174) 2,967,966 4.17 % 5.93 % 2,638,460\nNon-Agency RMBS\nSenior 40,284 40,284 197 — 40,481 8.07 % 8.03 % 29,105\nSubordinated 11,836 11,190 65 (2,836) 8,419 4.07 % 4.72 % 2,940\nIO 354,368 13,524 5,792 — 19,316 1.51 % 28.86 % —\nTotal Non-\nAgency RMBS 406,488 64,998 6,054 (2,836) 68,216 1.88 % 14.74 % 32,045\nU.S. Treasury\nsecurities 344,572 352,829 678 (4,419) 349,088 4.30 % 4.08 % 352,940\nTotal - AFS $ 4,889,852 3,344,430 61,269 (20,429) 3,385,270 3.94 % 6.04 % 3,023,445\nConsolidated SLST\nNon-Agency RMBS\nSubordinated $ 247,065 $ 185,540 $ 5,146 $ (47,928) $ 142,758 4.57 % 5.14 % $ 22,152\nIO 132,339 15,442 — (704) 14,738 3.50 % 8.48 % —\nTotal Non-\nAgency RMBS 379,404 200,982 5,146 (48,632) 157,496 4.18 % 5.41 % 22,152\nTotal - Consolidated\nSLST $ 379,404 $ 200,982 $ 5,146 $ (48,632) $ 157,496 4.18 % 5.41 % $ 22,152\nTotal Investment\nSecurities $ 5,269,256 $ 3,545,412 $ 66,415 $ (69,061) $ 3,542,766 3.96 % 6.00 % $ 3,045,597\n116\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnrealized Weighted Average\nOutstanding\nCurrent Par Amortized Repurchase\nInvestment Securities Value Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Coupon (1) Yield (2) Agreements (3)\nAvailable for Sale\n(“AFS”)\nAgency RMBS\nFixed rate $ 1,756,343 $ 1,761,138 $ 21,581 $ (1,829) $ 1,780,890 5.74 % 5.64 % $ 1,602,695\nAdjustable rate 149,052 147,460 1,741 — 149,201 5.48 % 5.35 % 137,084\nIO 1,139,828 52,623 6,813 (203) 59,233 0.76 % 14.81 % 31,657\nTotal Agency\nRMBS 3,045,223 1,961,221 30,135 (2,032) 1,989,324 4.34 % 5.79 % 1,771,436\nNon-Agency RMBS\nSenior 35 35 — (4) 31 3.65 % 3.60 % —\nSubordinated 8,164 7,526 — (4,281) 3,245 4.61 % 7.39 % —\nIO 375,563 14,571 6,646 — 21,217 1.63 % 27.42 % —\nTotal Non-\nAgency RMBS 383,762 22,132 6,646 (4,285) 24,493 1.70 % 20.27 % —\nTotal - AFS $ 3,428,985 $ 1,983,353 $ 36,781 $ (6,317) $ 2,013,817 3.64 % 6.20 % $ 1,771,436\nConsolidated SLST\nNon-Agency RMBS\nSubordinated $ 238,017 $ 189,962 $ — $ (49,684) $ 140,278 4.44 % 4.01 % $ 55,881\nIO 139,914 17,937 — (1,061) 16,876 3.50 % 7.43 % —\nTotal Non-\nAgency RMBS 377,931 207,899 — (50,745) 157,154 4.09 % 4.32 % 55,881\nTotal - Consolidated\nSLST $ 377,931 $ 207,899 $ — $ (50,745) $ 157,154 4.09 % 4.32 % $ 55,881\nTotal Investment\nSecurities $ 3,806,916 $ 2,191,252 $ 36,781 $ (57,062) $ 2,170,971 3.74 % 5.80 % $ 1,827,317\n(1) Our weighted average coupon was calculated by dividing our annualized coupon income by our weighted average current par value for the respective\nperiods.\n(2) Our weighted average yield was calculated by dividing our annualized interest income by our weighted average amortized cost for the respective\nperiods.\n(3) Outstanding repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2023 do not include $34.7 million of repurchase agreement financing for CDOs repurchased\nfrom our residential loan securitizations.

These repurchase agreements are short-term financings\nthat bear interest rates typically based on a spread to SOFR and are secured by the investment securities which they finance. Upon entering into a financing\ntransaction, our counterparties negotiate a “haircut”, which is the difference expressed in percentage terms between the fair value of the collateral and the amount\nthe counterparty will advance to us. The size of the haircut represents the counterparty’s perceived risk associated with holding the investment securities as\ncollateral. The haircut provides counterparties with a cushion for daily market value movements that reduce the need for margin calls or margins to be returned as\nnormal daily changes in investment security market values occur. The Company expects to roll outstanding amounts under its repurchase agreements into new\nrepurchase agreements or other financings, or to repay outstanding amounts, prior to or at maturity.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had no repurchase agreement exposure where the amount of investment securities at risk was in excess of 5%\nof the Company's stockholders’ equity. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate for repurchase agreements secured by investment securities\nwas 5.23%.\nThe following table details the quarterly average balance, ending balance and maximum balance at any month-end during each quarter in 2024, 2023\nand 2022 for our repurchase agreements secured by investment securities (dollar amounts in thousands):\nQuarterly Average End of Quarter Maximum Balance\nQuarter Ended Balance Balance at any Month-End\nSeptember 30, 2024 $ 2,772,203 $ 3,045,597 $ 3,045,597\nJune 30, 2024 2,202,770 2,447,851 2,447,851\nMarch 31, 2024 2,078,041 2,057,361 2,126,993\nDecember 31, 2023 1,851,577 1,862,063 1,870,941\nSeptember 30, 2023 1,184,714 1,490,996 1,490,996\nJune 30, 2023 492,473 664,459 664,459\nMarch 31, 2023 131,174 226,778 226,778\nDecember 31, 2022 50,077 50,077 50,077\nSeptember 30, 2022 53,159 53,159 53,159\nJune 30, 2022 132,712 129,331 138,301\nMarch 31, 2022 116,766 144,852 144,852\nCollateralized Debt Obligations\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed a re-securitization of its investment in certain subordinated securities\nissued by Consolidated SLST, which we refer to as our non-Agency RMBS re-securitization. The Company engaged in the re-securitization transaction primarily\nfor the purpose of obtaining non-recourse, longer-term financing on a portion of its investment in Consolidated SLST. The Company remains economically\nexposed to the subordinated positions in the portion of Consolidated SLST transferred to the securitization and continues to consolidate Consolidated SLST.\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a summary of CDOs issued by our non-Agency RMBS re-securitization as of September 30, 2024:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nOutstanding Face\nAmount Carrying Value Interest Rate (1)(2) Stated Maturity (3)\nNon-Agency RMBS re-securitization at fair value (4) $ 72,221 $ 72,638 7.38 % 2064\n(1) Interest rate is calculated using the outstanding face amount and stated interest rate of notes issued by the securitization and not owned by the Company.\n(2) The Company's non-Agency RMBS re-securitization CDOs contain an interest rate step-up feature whereby the interest rate increases if the outstanding\nnotes are not redeemed by an expected redemption date, as defined in the governing documents.

The CDOs\nare also subject to redemption prior to the stated maturity according to the terms of the governing documents. As a result, the actual maturity of the\nCDOs may occur earlier than the stated maturity.\n(4) The Company has elected the fair value option for CDOs issued by its non-Agency RMBS re-securitization (see Note 16). For the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized $0.7 million in net unrealized losses on its non-Agency RMBS re-securitization, which are\nincluded in unrealized gains (losses), net on the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n119\nTable of Contents\nMezzanine Lending\nThe Company's Mezzanine Lending strategy may include preferred equity in, and mezzanine loans to, entities that have multi-family real estate assets.\nA preferred equity investment is an equity investment in the entity that owns the underlying property and mezzanine loans are secured by a pledge of the\nborrower’s equity ownership in the property. We evaluate our Mezzanine Lending investments for accounting treatment as loans versus equity investments.\nMezzanine Lending investments for which the characteristics, facts and circumstances indicate that loan accounting treatment is appropriate are included in\nmulti-family loans on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nMezzanine Lending investments where the risks and payment characteristics are equivalent to an equity investment are accounted for using the equity\nmethod of accounting and are included in equity investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company records its equity in earnings or losses\nfrom these Mezzanine Lending investments under the hypothetical liquidation of book value method of accounting due to the structures and the preferences it\nreceives on the distributions from these entities pursuant to the respective agreements. Under this method, the Company recognizes income or loss in each period\nbased on the change in liquidation proceeds it would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of its investment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reconsidered its evaluation of its variable interest in a VIE that owned a multi-family\napartment community and in which the Company holds a preferred equity investment. The Company determined that it gained the power to direct the activities,\nand became primary beneficiary, of the VIE and consolidated the VIE into its consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company negotiated a short-term maturity extension on one preferred equity investment that\nincluded an increase in preferred return rate to a current market rate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reduced the fair value of\none defaulted preferred equity investment to zero as a result of developments with respect to the property, its financing and market conditions. This investment\nrepresents 1.6% of the total investment amount of the Mezzanine Lending portfolio. Also during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\nevaluated the recoverability of the preferred returns on one preferred equity investment and its preferred equity investment in a Consolidated VIE and ceased\nfurther accruals.

The Company accounts\nfor this investment using the equity method and has elected the fair value option. The following table summarizes our ownership interest in the entity that\noriginates residential loans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (dollar amounts in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOwnership Ownership\nStrategy Interest Fair Value Interest Fair Value\nConstructive Loans, LLC Residential Loans 50% $ 46,455 50% $ 37,154\nTotal $ 46,455 $ 37,154\n127\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company enters into derivative\nfinancial instruments in connection with its risk management activities. These derivative instruments may include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, credit\ndefault swaps, futures and options contracts such as options on credit default swap indices, equity index options, swaptions and options on futures. The Company\nmay also pursue forward-settling purchases or sales of Agency RMBS where the underlying pools of mortgage loans are “To-Be-Announced,” or TBAs,\npurchase options on U.S. Treasury futures or invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities. The Company elected not to apply hedge accounting for its\nderivative instruments.\nThe Company and Consolidated Real Estate VIEs are required by lenders on certain repurchase agreement financing and variable-rate mortgages\npayable on real estate to enter into interest rate cap contracts. These interest rate cap contracts are with a counterparty that involve the receipt of variable-rate\namounts from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. During the period these contracts\nare open, changes in the value of the contract are recognized as gains or losses on derivative instruments.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings. Interest rate swaps generally\ninvolve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty, based on SOFR, in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the\ninterest rate swap without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to manage its position with regard to its\nliabilities, the Company may also enter into interest rate swaps which involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company\nmaking variable-rate payments, based on SOFR, over the life of the interest rate swap without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The variable rate we\npay or receive under our swap agreements has the effect of offsetting the repricing characteristics and cash flows of the Company's financing arrangements.\nThe Company may purchase equity index put options that give the Company the right to sell or buy the underlying index at a specified strike price and\nU.S. Treasury future contracts that obligate the Company to sell or buy U.S. Treasury securities for future delivery. The Company has purchased credit default\nswap index contracts under which a counterparty, in exchange for a premium, agrees to compensate the Company for the financial loss associated with the\noccurrence of a credit event in relation to a notional value of an index. The Company may also purchase credit default swap index options that allow the\nCompany to enter into a fixed rate payor position in the underlying credit default swap index at the agreed strike level.\n128\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nThe Company's debt as of September 30, 2024 included senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures.\n9.125% Senior Notes due 2029\nOn June 28, 2024, the Company completed the issuance of $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 9.125% Senior Notes due 2029 (the\n\"9.125% Senior Notes\") in an underwritten public offering. The 9.125% Senior Notes were issued at par, bear interest at a rate equal to 9.125% per year and\nmature on July 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed.\n5.75% Senior Notes due 2026\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \"5.75% Senior Notes\")\noutstanding. The 5.75% Senior Notes were issued at par and carry deferred charges resulting in a total cost to the Company of approximately 6.64%. The\nCompany's 5.75% Senior Notes, which mature on April 30, 2026, contain various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum net asset value, ratio of\nunencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness and senior debt service coverage ratio and limit the amount of leverage the Company may utilize and its ability\nto transfer the Company’s assets substantially as an entirety or merge into or consolidate with another person.\nSubordinated Debentures\nAs of September 30, 2024, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries had trust preferred securities outstanding of $45.0 million with a weighted average\ninterest rate of 8.99% which are due in 2035. The securities are fully guaranteed by us with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation,\nredemption or repayment. These securities are classified as subordinated debentures in the liability section of our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n129\nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Analysis - Company's Stockholders’ Equity\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company's stockholders' equity at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively (dollar\namounts in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n8.000% Series D Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock $ 147,745 $ 147,745\n7.875% Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 177,697 177,697\n6.875% Series F Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 138,418 138,418\n7.000% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 71,585 71,585\nCommon stock 906 907\nAdditional paid-in capital 2,278,869 2,297,081\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss — (4)\nAccumulated deficit (1,371,073) (1,253,817)\nCompany's stockholders' equity $ 1,444,147 $ 1,579,612\n130\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements. Our short-term (the 12 months ending September 30, 2025) and long-term\n(beyond September 30, 2025) liquidity requirements include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain investments, comply with margin\nrequirements, fund our operations, pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs. Generally, our short-term and long-term liquidity needs\nare met by our existing cash balances and our investments and assets which generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments,\nprepayments, net earnings retained prior to payment of dividends and distributions from equity investments. In addition, we may satisfy our short-term and/or\nlong-term liquidity needs through the sale of assets from our investment portfolio, securities offerings or the securitization or collateralized financing of our\nassets.\nSince late March 2020, we have focused on strengthening our balance sheet and long-term capital preservation primarily by focusing on assets and\nmarkets that provide compelling risk-adjusted returns through either an unlevered strategy or through residential loan repurchase agreement financing with terms\nof one year or more or sustainable non-mark-to-market financing arrangements, including securitizations and non-mark-to-market repurchase agreement\nfinancing. Beginning in the year ended December 31, 2023, we have been expanding our holdings of Agency RMBS, which is more liquid than many if not all of\nthe investments in our portfolio of credit investments, and have utilized mark-to-market repurchase agreement financing to fund that expansion. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company’s portfolio recourse leverage ratio of 2.5x, remains within our target range. As of September 30, 2024, 62% of our debt,\nexcluding mortgages payable on real estate and Consolidated SLST CDOs, is subject to mark-to-market margin calls, with 46% collateralized by Agency RMBS,\n6% collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities and 10% collateralized by residential credit assets. The remaining 38% has no exposure to collateral repricing by\nour counterparties.\nWe expect to continue to opportunistically dispose of assets from our portfolio, including our joint venture equity investments, and generate relatively\nhigh portfolio turnover in order to pursue investments across the residential housing sector with a focus on acquiring assets with less price sensitivity to credit\ndeterioration that are capable of expanding our interest income, like Agency RMBS, and maintaining low duration credit exposure by purchasing high-coupon\nbusiness purpose loans. We also intend to maintain a solid position in unrestricted cash and remain committed to prudently managing our liabilities. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $188.9 million of available cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash and cash equivalents held by Consolidated Real Estate VIEs),\n$203.7 million of unencumbered investment securities (including certain securities we own in Consolidated SLST and CDOs repurchased from our residential\nloan securitizations), and $107.2 million of unencumbered residential loans.\nWe historically have endeavored to fund our investments and operations through a balanced and diverse funding mix, including proceeds from the\nissuance of common and preferred equity and debt securities, short-term and longer-term repurchase agreements and CDOs. With respect to the multi-family\nproperties in which we hold joint venture equity investments, the properties are encumbered by a senior mortgage loan. The type and terms of the ultimate\nfinancing used by us depends on the asset being financed and the financing available at the time of the financing. We have placed a greater emphasis on\nprocuring longer-termed and/or more committed financing arrangements for our credit investments, such as securitizations, term financings and corporate debt\nsecurities that provide less or no exposure to fluctuations in the collateral repricing determinations of financing counterparties or rapid liquidity reductions in\nrepurchase agreement financing markets. Although we expect our leverage to continue to move higher as we access additional liquidity and grow our investment\nportfolio further, we intend to continue to focus on procuring longer-term and non-mark-to-market financing arrangements for certain parts of our credit\nportfolio.\nBased on current market conditions, our current investment portfolio, new investment initiatives, expectations to dispose of assets from time to time on\nterms favorable to us, leverage ratio and available and future possible financing arrangements, we believe our existing cash balances, funds available under our\nvarious financing arrangements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will continue to explore\nadditional financing arrangements to further strengthen our balance sheet and position ourselves for future investment opportunities, including, without\nlimitation, additional issuances of our equity and debt securities and longer-termed financing arrangements; however, no assurance can be given that we will be\nable to access any such financing, or the size, timing or terms thereof.\n131\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows and Liquidity for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased by $1.4 million.\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nWe used net cash flows in operating activities totaling $15.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cash flow used in operating\nactivities differs from our net loss due to these primary factors: (i) differences between (a) accretion, amortization, depreciation and recognition of income and\nlosses recorded with respect to our investments and (b) the cash received therefrom and (ii) unrealized gains and losses on our investments (including impairment\nof real estate and loss on reclassification of disposal group).\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash flows used in investing activities were $1.7 billion, primarily as a result of purchases of\ninvestment securities and residential loans, capital expenditures on real estate and net variation margin paid for derivative instruments. This was partially offset\nby principal repayments received on residential loans and investment securities, net proceeds from the sale of residential loans and real estate, net payments\nreceived from derivative instruments, principal repayments received on preferred equity and mezzanine loans and return of capital from equity investments.\nAlthough we generally intend to hold our assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of these assets in order to manage our interest rate risk\nand liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives or to adapt to market conditions. We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of assets, if any.\nBecause a portion of our assets are financed through repurchase agreements or CDOs, a portion of the proceeds from any sales of or principal\nrepayments on our assets may be used to repay balances under these financing sources. Accordingly, all or a significant portion of cash flows from principal\nrepayments received from residential loans, including residential loans held in Consolidated SLST, and proceeds from sales or principal paydowns received from\ninvestment securities available for sale were used to repay CDOs issued by the respective Consolidated VIEs or repurchase agreements (included as cash used in\nfinancing activities). Additionally, a significant portion of cash flows from the sale of real estate held in Consolidated VIEs, if any, were used to repay\noutstanding mortgages payable on real estate held in Consolidated VIEs.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.7 billion. The main sources of cash\nflows from financing activities were proceeds received from repurchase agreements and proceeds from the issuance of CDOs and senior unsecured notes. This\nwas partially offset by paydowns on and extinguishment of CDOs, payments made on Consolidated SLST CDOs, net payments made on mortgages payable on\nreal estate and dividend payments on both common and preferred stock.\n132\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity – Financing Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have outstanding short-term repurchase agreement financing on our investment securities, a form of collateralized short-\nterm financing, with multiple financial institutions. The repurchase agreements we use to finance our investment securities are secured by certain of our\ninvestment securities and bear interest rates that move in close relationship to SOFR. Any financings under these repurchase agreements are based on the fair\nvalue of the assets that serve as collateral under these agreements. Interest rate changes and increased prepayment activity can have a negative impact on the\nvaluation of these securities, reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements. Moreover, these repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to\ndetermine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed, the counterparty can\neffectively call the loan at any time. Market value of the collateral represents the price of such collateral obtained from generally recognized sources or the most\nrecent closing bid quotation from such source plus accrued income. If a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased, the counterparty\nmay initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding amount financed in cash,\non minimal notice, and repurchase may be accelerated upon an event of default under the repurchase agreements. Moreover, in the event an existing counterparty\nelected to not renew the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement, we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or\nproceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance, or any combination thereof. If we\nwere unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral, we would expect to incur a loss. In addition, in the event a\nrepurchase agreement counterparty defaults on its obligation to “re-sell” or return to us the assets that are securing the financing at the end of the term of the\nrepurchase agreement, we would incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of “haircut” associated with the short-term repurchase agreement, which we\nsometimes refer to as the “amount at risk.”\nAt September 30, 2024, we had longer-term repurchase agreements with initial terms of up to two years with multiple third-party financial institutions\nthat are secured by certain of our residential loans, real estate owned and single-family rental properties. The outstanding financing under five of these repurchase\nagreements are subject to margin calls to the extent the market value of the collateral falls below specified levels. We have entered into or amended repurchase\nagreements with two counterparties that are secured by certain of our residential loans and are not subject to margin calls in the event the market value of the\ncollateral declines. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Balance Sheet Analysis—Residential Loans,\nReal Estate Owned and Single-Family Rental Property Financing—Repurchase Agreements\" for further information. During the terms of the repurchase\nagreements secured by residential loans, proceeds from the residential loans will be applied to pay any price differential, if applicable, and to reduce the\naggregate repurchase price of the collateral. Repurchase of the residential loans, real estate owned and single-family rental properties financed by the repurchase\nagreements may be accelerated upon an event of default. The repurchase agreements secured by residential loans, real estate owned and single-family rental\nproperties contain various covenants, including among other things, the maintenance of certain amounts of liquidity and stockholders' equity (as defined in the\nrespective agreements). As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate amount at risk under repurchase agreements secured by residential loans, real estate\nowned and single-family rental properties of approximately $183.7 million, which represents the difference between the carrying value of the collateral pledged\nand the outstanding balance of our repurchase agreements. Significant margin calls have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition, business, liquidity and ability to make distributions to our stockholders. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources—General”\nabove.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had assets available to be posted as margin which included liquid assets, such as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents,\nand unencumbered investment securities that could be monetized to pay down or collateralize a liability immediately. As of September 30, 2024, we had $188.9\nmillion included in cash and cash equivalents and $203.7 million in unencumbered investment securities available to meet additional haircuts or market valuation\nrequirements. The unencumbered investment securities that we believe may be posted as margin as of September 30, 2024 included $43.2 million of non-Agency\nRMBS (including an IO security we own in Consolidated SLST and CDOs repurchased from our residential loan securitizations) and $160.5 million of Agency\nRMBS.\n133\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes outstanding. The 5.75% Senior Notes were\nissued at 100% of the principal amount and bear interest at a rate equal to 5.75% per year (subject to adjustment from time to time based on changes in the\nratings of the 5.75% Senior Notes by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations), payable semi-annually in arrears on April 30 and\nOctober 30 of each year, and mature on April 30, 2026, unless earlier redeemed. The Company has the right to redeem the 5.75% Senior Notes, in whole or in\npart, prior to maturity, subject to a \"make-whole\" premium or other date-dependent multiples of principal amount redeemed. No sinking fund is provided for the\n5.75% Senior Notes. The Company's 5.75% Senior Notes also contain various covenants including the maintenance of a minimum net asset value, ratio of\nunencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness and senior debt service coverage ratio and limit the amount of leverage the Company may utilize and its ability\nto transfer the Company’s assets substantially as an entirety or merge into or consolidate with another person.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Senior Notes outstanding. The 9.125% Senior Notes\nwere issued at 100% of the principal amount and bear interest at a rate equal to 9.125% per year, payable quarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1, and\nOctober 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024, and mature on July 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed. The Company has the right to redeem the 9.125%\nSenior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after July 1, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount redeemed. No\nsinking fund is provided for the 9.125% Senior Notes.\nAt September 30, 2024, we also had other longer-term debt which includes Company-sponsored residential loan securitization CDOs with a carrying\nvalue of $1.9 billion and non-Agency RMBS re-securitization CDOs with a carrying value of $72.6 million. We had 13 Company-sponsored securitizations with\nCDOs outstanding as of September 30, 2024. See Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion.\nThe real estate assets held by our multi-family joint venture equity investments are subject to mortgages payable. We have no obligation for repayment\nof the mortgages payable but, with respect to certain of the mortgages payable, we may execute a guaranty related to commitment of bad acts and our equity\ninvestment may be lost or reduced to the extent a lender forecloses on the property.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our Company recourse leverage ratio, which represents our total outstanding recourse repurchase agreement financing,\nsubordinated debentures and senior unsecured notes divided by our total stockholders' equity, was approximately 2.6 to 1. Our Company recourse leverage ratio\ndoes not include outstanding non-recourse repurchase agreement financing, debt associated with CDOs or mortgages payable on real estate, including mortgages\npayable on real estate of disposal group held for sale. As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio recourse leverage ratio, which represents our outstanding recourse\nrepurchase agreement financing divided by our total stockholders' equity, was approximately 2.5 to 1. We monitor all at risk or shorter-term financings to enable\nus to respond to market disruptions as they arise.\nLiquidity – Hedging and Other Factors\nCertain of our hedging instruments may also impact our liquidity. We may use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, credit default swaps, futures and\noptions contracts such as options on credit default swap indices, equity index options, swaptions and options on futures. We may also use TBAs or other futures\ncontracts to hedge interest rate and market value risk associated with our investment portfolio.\nThe Company and Consolidated Real Estate VIEs are required by lenders on certain repurchase agreement financing and variable-rate mortgages\npayable on real estate to enter into interest rate cap contracts. These interest rate cap contracts are with a counterparty that involve the receipt of variable-rate\namounts from the counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. During the period these contracts\nare open, changes in the value of the contract are recognized as gains or losses on derivative instruments. The joint venture entities that own the multi-family\nproperties will be required to enter into new interest rate cap contracts upon their expiration and may require the Company to contribute additional capital to the\nrespective joint venture.\nWith respect to interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures contracts and TBAs, initial margin deposits, which can be comprised of either cash or\ninvestment securities, will be made upon entering into these contracts. During the period these contracts are open, changes in the value of the contract are\nrecognized as unrealized gains or losses by marking to market on a daily basis to reflect the market value of these contracts at the end of each day’s trading. We\nmay be required to satisfy variation margin payments periodically, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. In addition, because delivery\nof TBAs extend beyond the typical settlement dates for most non-derivative investments, these transactions are more prone to market fluctuations between the\ntrade date and the ultimate settlement date, and thereby are more vulnerable to increasing amounts at risk with the applicable counterparties.\n134\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity — Securities Offerings\nIn addition to the financing arrangements described above under the caption “Liquidity—Financing Arrangements,” we also rely on follow-on equity\nofferings of common and preferred stock, and may utilize from time to time debt securities offerings, as a source of both short-term and long-term liquidity. We\nalso may generate liquidity through the sale of shares of our common stock or preferred stock in “at-the-market” equity offering programs pursuant to equity\ndistribution agreements, as well as through the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”), which provides for the\nissuance of up to $20.0 million of shares of our common stock. The Company issued the 9.125% Senior Notes in an underwritten public offering during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nPreferred Stock and Common Stock Repurchase Programs\nIn March 2023, the Board of Directors approved a $100.0 million preferred stock repurchase program. The program, which expires March 31, 2025,\nallows the Company to make repurchases of shares of preferred stock, from time to time, in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions\nor block trades or other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Company did not repurchase any\nshares of its preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, $97.6 million of the approved amount remained\navailable for the repurchase of shares of preferred stock under the preferred stock repurchase program.\nIn February 2022, the Board of Directors approved a $200.0 million common stock repurchase program. In March 2023, the Board of Directors\napproved an upsize of the common stock repurchase program to $246.0 million. The program, which expires March 31, 2025, allows the Company to make\nrepurchases of shares of common stock, from time to time, in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means,\nin accordance with applicable securities laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 587,347 shares of its common stock\npursuant to the common stock repurchase program for a total cost of approximately $3.5 million, including fees and commissions paid to the broker, representing\nan average repurchase price of $5.95 per common share. As of September 30, 2024, $189.7 million of the approved amount remained available for the repurchase\nof shares of the Company's common stock under the common stock repurchase program.\nDividends\nFor information regarding the declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock for the periods covered by this report,\nplease see Note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nOur Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary, based on our earnings and\nfinancial condition, capital requirements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions on making distributions under Maryland law and such other factors\nas our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends.\nWe intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our REIT status and to minimize or avoid\ncorporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax. However, differences in timing between the recognition of REIT taxable income and the actual receipt of\ncash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements and to minimize or avoid corporate\nincome tax and the nondeductible excise tax.\nIn the event we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock, the Company would become subject to certain limitations on its ability to pay dividends or\nredeem or repurchase its common stock or preferred stock.\nCommitment to Fund Business Purpose Loans\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments to fund up to $222.4 million of additional advances on existing business purpose loans.\nThese commitments are generally subject to loan agreements with terms that must be met before we fund advances on the commitment.\n135\nTable of Contents\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interest\nPursuant to the operating agreement for one of our joint venture equity investments, third party investors in this joint venture have the ability to sell their\nownership interests to us, at their election, once a year subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, and we are obligated to purchase, subject to\ncertain conditions, such interests for cash. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of\nredeemable non-controlling interest.\n136\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThis section should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand in our subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nWe seek to manage risks that we believe will impact our business including interest rates, liquidity, prepayments, credit quality and market value. When\nmanaging these risks we consider the impact on our assets, liabilities and derivative positions. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risk\ncan be quantified from historical experience. We seek to actively manage that risk, to generate risk-adjusted total returns that we believe compensate us\nappropriately for those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we take.\nThe following analysis includes forward-looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur. Actual results may differ materially from\nthese projections due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial, mortgage and real\nestate markets. Developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their\nimpact on our portfolio yield, cost of funds and cash flows. The analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered\nprojections of future events or operating performance.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rates are sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary or tax policies, domestic and international economic conditions, including\ninflation and deflation and political or regulatory matters beyond our control. Changes in interest rates affect, among other things, the value of the assets we\nmanage and hold in our investment portfolio and the variable-rate borrowings and floating-rate preferred stock we use or issue to fund our operations and\nportfolio. Changes in interest rates also affect the interest rate swaps and caps, TBAs and other securities or instruments we may use to hedge our portfolio. As a\nresult, our net interest income and adjusted net interest income are particularly affected by changes in interest rates.\nFor example, we hold residential loans and RMBS, some of which may have fixed rates or interest rates that adjust on various dates that are not\nsynchronized to the adjustment dates on our repurchase agreements. In general, the re-pricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the re-\npricing of our variable-interest rate assets. Thus, it is likely that our floating rate financing, such as our repurchase agreements, may react to interest rates before\nour residential loans or RMBS because the weighted average next re-pricing dates on the related financing may have shorter time periods than that of the\nresidential loans or RMBS. Moreover, changes in interest rates can directly impact prepayment speeds, thereby affecting our net return on residential loans and\nRMBS. During a declining interest rate environment, the prepayment of residential loans and RMBS may accelerate (as borrowers may opt to refinance at a\nlower interest rate) causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of repurchase agreements to increase relative to the amount of residential\nloans and RMBS, possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on residential loans and RMBS, as replacement residential loans and RMBS may have a lower\nyield than those being prepaid. Conversely, during an increasing interest rate environment, residential loans and RMBS may prepay more slowly than expected,\nrequiring us to finance a higher amount of residential loans and RMBS than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher, resulting in a\ndecline in our net return on residential loans and RMBS. Accordingly, each of these scenarios can negatively impact our net interest income and adjusted net\ninterest income. In addition, when we purchase residential loans at a discount to par value, and borrowers then prepay at a slower rate than we expected, the\ndecreased prepayments would result in a lower yield than expected on the asset and/or may result in a decline in the fair value of the residential loans.\nWe seek to manage interest rate risk in our portfolio by utilizing interest rate caps, interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, options on futures and U.S.\nTreasury securities with the goal of optimizing earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values. Certain of our consolidated multi-\nfamily properties with variable-rate mortgages payable have entered into interest rate cap contracts as required by the respective mortgage loan agreements. The\nCompany also has an interest rate cap contract related to a repurchase agreement for residential loans, as required by the counterparty.\n137\nTable of Contents\nWe utilize a model-based risk analysis system to assist in projecting interest rate-sensitive asset and liability portfolio performances over a scenario of\ndifferent interest rates. Computation of the cash flows for interest rate-sensitive assets that may affect annualized adjusted net interest income are based on\nassumptions related to, among other things, prepayment speeds, slope of the yield curve, and composition and size of our portfolio. Assumptions for interest rate-\nsensitive liabilities relate to, among other things, anticipated interest rates, collateral requirements as a percentage of repurchase agreement financings and\namounts and terms of borrowings. As these assumptions may not be realized, adjusted net interest income results may therefore be significantly different from\nthe annualized adjusted net interest income produced in our analyses. We also note that the uncertainty associated with the estimate of a change in adjusted net\ninterest income is directly related to the size of interest rate move considered.\nBased on the results of the model, the instantaneous changes in interest rates specified below would have had the following effect on annualized\nadjusted net interest income based on our assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\nChanges in Interest Rates (basis points) Changes in Adjusted Net Interest Income (1) (2)\n+200 $ (72,912)\n+100 $ (36,461)\n-100 $ 36,373\n-200 $ 72,808\n(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See Item 2, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their\nmost directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(2) Certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the table and, as such, there can be no assurance\nthat assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates\nas of September 30, 2024. This analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management's judgment and experience. Future purchases and sales\nof assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile.\nWhile this table reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on the static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio and continuously make\nadjustments to the size and composition of our asset and derivative hedge portfolios and interest-bearing liabilities. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimated in the table.\nInterest rate changes may also impact our GAAP book value and adjusted book value as many of our assets and related hedge derivatives, if any, are\nmarked-to-market each quarter. Generally, as interest rates increase, the value of our mortgage-related assets decreases, and conversely, as interest rates decrease,\nthe value of such investments will increase. In general, we expect that, over time, decreases in the value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes may\nbe offset, to the degree we are hedged, by increases in the value of our interest rate swaps or other financial instruments used for hedging purposes, and vice\nversa. However, the relationship between spreads on our assets and spreads on our hedging instruments may vary from time to time, resulting in a net aggregate\nGAAP book value and adjusted book value increase or decline. In addition, changes in interest rates could also have an impact on net operating income generated\nby our consolidated multi-family properties which consequently could have an impact on valuation of underlying real estate.\nOur net interest income, adjusted net interest income and the fair value of our assets and our financing activities could be negatively affected by\nvolatility in interest rates, as has been the case throughout much of 2022, 2023 and continuing in 2024. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable\nmarket conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in\ninterest rates could cause a loss of future net interest income and adjusted net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets.\nFluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all or\nsubstantially all of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating\nresults, or financial condition.\n138\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain\ninvestments, pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs. The primary liquidity risk we face arises from financing long-maturity assets\nwith shorter-term financings. We recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business. We manage and forecast our liquidity needs and sources\ndaily to ensure that we have adequate liquidity at all times. We plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of\nassets or emergency borrowing of funds.\nWe are subject to “margin call” risk on a significant portion of our repurchase agreements and certain derivative instruments. In the event the value of\nour assets pledged as collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, margin calls could increase, causing an adverse change in our\nliquidity position. Additionally, if one or more of our repurchase agreement counterparties chooses not to provide ongoing funding, we may be unable to replace\nthe financing through other lenders on favorable terms or at all.\nWe also utilize longer-termed and/or more committed financing arrangements for certain of our credit investments, such as securitizations, term\nfinancings and corporate debt securities that provide less or no exposure to fluctuations in the collateral repricing determinations of financing counterparties or\nrapid liquidity reductions in repurchase agreement financing markets. These financings may involve greater expense relative to repurchase agreement funding.\nWe provide no assurance that we will be able in the future to access sources of capital that are attractive to us, that we will be able to roll over or replace our\nrepurchase agreements or other financing instruments as they mature from time to time in the future or that we otherwise will not need to resort to unplanned\nsales of assets to provide liquidity in the future. See Item 2, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\" and the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our liquidity and capital\nresource management.\nPrepayment Risk\nWhen borrowers repay the principal on their residential loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization, the effect is to shorten the\nperiod over which interest is earned, and therefore, reduce the yield for residential mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance.\nConversely, residential mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance, such as many of our residential loans, may exhibit higher yields due to\nfaster prepayments. Furthermore, actual prepayment speeds may differ from our modeled prepayment speed projections impacting the effectiveness of any\nhedges we may have in place to mitigate financing and/or fair value risk. Generally, when market interest rates decline, borrowers have a tendency to refinance\ntheir mortgages, thereby increasing prepayments. Therefore, increased prepayments on our investments may accelerate the redeployment of our capital to\ngenerally lower yielding investments. Similarly, decreased prepayments are generally associated with increasing market interest rates and may slow our ability to\nredeploy capital to generally higher-yielding investments.\nOur modeled prepayments will help determine the amount of hedging we use to offset changes in interest rates. If actual prepayment rates are higher\nthan modeled, the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular residential mortgage asset. Conversely, when we have paid\na premium, if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled, we would amortize the premium over a longer time period, resulting in a higher\nyield to maturity.\nIn an environment of increasing prepayment speeds, the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement\nof the principal paydowns may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties.\nWe mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our residential mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with similar\nstructures, quantities and characteristics. Furthermore, we stress-test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or\nmake modifications to our hedge balances. Historically, we have not hedged 100% of our liability costs due to prepayment risk.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in our credit sensitive assets, including residential loans, non-Agency\nRMBS, preferred equity and mezzanine loan and joint venture equity investments, due to borrower defaults or defaults by our operating partners in their payment\nobligations to us. In selecting the credit sensitive assets in our portfolio, we seek to identify and invest in assets with characteristics that we believe offset or limit\nour exposure to defaults.\n139\nTable of Contents\nWe seek to manage credit risk through our pre-acquisition or pre-funding due diligence process, and by factoring projected credit losses into the\npurchase price we pay or loan terms we negotiate for all of our credit sensitive assets. In general, we evaluate relative valuation, supply and demand trends,\nprepayment rates, delinquency and default rates, vintage of collateral and macroeconomic factors as part of this process. Nevertheless, these procedures provide\nno assurance that we will not experience unanticipated credit losses which would materially affect our operating results. We also manage credit risk with credit\ndefault swaps on corporate bond indices (CDX) for which the Company buys credit protection and pays periodic payments at fixed rates to credit protection\nsellers, in return for compensation for default (or similar credit event) by a reference index.\nRecent inflationary pressures have caused, and a possible economic recession or stagnation in the U.S. in the near future may cause, an increase in the\ncredit risk of our credit sensitive assets. We would expect delinquencies, defaults and requests for forbearance arrangements to rise should savings, incomes and\nrevenues of renters, borrowers, operating partners and other businesses become increasingly constrained from a slow-down in economic activity. Any future\nperiod of payment deferrals, forbearance, delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures or losses will likely adversely affect our net interest income and adjusted net\ninterest income from multi-family loans, residential loans, and our RMBS investments and rental income and reduce the distributions we receive from our joint\nventure equity investments in multi-family apartment communities, the fair value of these assets, our ability to liquidate the collateral that may underlie these\ninvestments or obtain additional financing and the future profitability of our investments. Further, in the event of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosure,\nregulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers and renters may slow or prevent us from taking remediation actions or optimizing a resolution for\nor exit from the asset.\nWe purchase certain residential loans at a discount to par, reflecting a perceived higher risk of default. In connection with our loan acquisitions, we or a\nthird-party due diligence firm perform an independent review of the mortgage file to assess the state of mortgage loan files, the servicing of the mortgage loan,\ncompliance with existing guidelines, as well as our ability to enforce the contractual rights in the mortgage. We also obtain certain representations and warranties\nfrom each seller with respect to the mortgage loans, as well as the enforceability of the lien on the mortgaged property. A seller who breaches these\nrepresentations and warranties may be obligated to repurchase the loan from us. In addition, as part of our process, we focus on selecting a servicer with the\nappropriate expertise to mitigate losses and maximize our overall return on these residential loans. This involves, among other things, performing due diligence\non the servicer prior to their engagement, assigning the appropriate servicer for each loan based on certain characteristics and monitoring each servicer's\nperformance on an ongoing basis.\nInvestments in non-Agency RMBS, CMBS and ABS also contain credit risk. These investments typically consist of either the senior, mezzanine or\nsubordinate tranches in securitizations. The underlying collateral of these securitizations may be exposed to various macroeconomic and asset-specific credit\nrisks. These securities have varying levels of credit enhancement which provide some structural protection from losses within the securitization. We undertake an\nin-depth assessment of the underlying collateral and securitization structure when investing in these assets, which may include modeling defaults, prepayments\nand losses across different scenarios. In addition, we are exposed to credit risk in our Mezzanine Lending and equity investments in owners of multi-family\nproperties, including joint venture equity investments in multi-family apartment communities. The performance and value of these investments depend upon the\napplicable operating partner’s or borrower’s ability to effectively operate the multi-family properties that serve as the underlying collateral to produce cash flows\nadequate to pay distributions, interest or principal due to us. The Company monitors the performance and credit quality of the underlying assets in which it\ninvests or that serve as collateral for its investments. In connection with these types of investments by us in multi-family properties, the procedures for ongoing\nmonitoring include financial statement analysis and regularly scheduled site inspections of portfolio properties to assess property physical condition, performance\nof on-site staff and competitive activity in the sub-market. We also formulate annual budgets and performance goals alongside our operating partners for use in\nmeasuring the ongoing investment performance and credit quality of our investments. Additionally, the Company's preferred equity and equity investments\ntypically provide us with various rights and remedies to protect our investment.\n140\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Risk\nChanges in interest rates, market liquidity, credit quality and other factors also expose us to market value (fair value) fluctuation on our assets, liabilities\nand hedges. For certain of our credit sensitive assets, fair values may only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques, such\nas computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. However, the determination of\nestimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise and extremely volatile periods or disruptions in the market, such as during the severe market\ndisruption that occurred in 2020 or the current volatile market environment, make such estimates and assumptions inherently less certain. As a result, we believe\nour market value (fair value) risk has significantly increased. Minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these\nderived or estimated fair values.\nOur fair value estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate and business environments as of September 30, 2024 and do not take into\nconsideration the effects of subsequent changes. The following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial\ninstruments:\nFair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. These techniques\ninvolve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial\ninstruments, discount rates, estimate of future cash flows, future expected loss experience and other factors.\nChanges in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values. Derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by\ncomparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument. Also, because of differences in\nmethodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values, the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies.\nThe table below presents the sensitivity of the fair value of our portfolio as of September 30, 2024, using a discounted cash flow simulation model\nassuming an instantaneous interest rate shift. Application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets, liabilities and\nhedging instruments per 100 basis point shift in interest rates.\nThis analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in certain of our assets including constraints on the re-pricing of the interest\nrate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features, as well as prepayment options. Assets and liabilities that are not interest rate-sensitive such as\ncash, payment receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and accrued expenses are excluded.\nChanges in assumptions including, but not limited to, volatility, mortgage and financing spreads, prepayment behavior, credit conditions, defaults, as\nwell as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model. Therefore, actual results are likely to vary from modeled results.\nFair Value Changes\nChanges in Interest Rates Changes in Fair Value (1) Percentage Change in Portfolio Fair Value (1)\n(basis points) (dollar amounts in thousands)\n+200 $(164,894) (3.00)%\n+100 $(110,661) (2.02)%\nBase —\n-100 $45,100 0.82%\n-200 $101,784 1.85%\n(1) Includes residential loans, Mezzanine Lending investments, investment securities, derivatives and residential loan securitizations, non-Agency RMBS\nre-securitization and senior unsecured notes at fair value.\nAlthough the use of a model to perform market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted as a tool in identifying potential risk in a changing interest\nrate environment, it should be noted that the model does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as, but not limited to, changes in portfolio\ncomposition, financing strategies, market spreads, business volumes or overall market liquidity. Accordingly, we make extensive use of an earnings simulation\nmodel to further analyze our level of interest rate risk.\n141\nTable of Contents\nCapital Market Risk\nWe are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets, and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock, preferred\nstock or other equity instruments. We are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets, and our related ability to finance our business through credit\nfacilities or other debt instruments. As a REIT, we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually, which constrains our ability to\naccumulate operating cash flow and therefore may require us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business. We seek to mitigate these risks by\nmonitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount, timing, and terms of capital we raise. Based on the currently uncertain\nmarket environment, we expect the capital markets to remain volatile and uncertain at varying levels for the near future and this may adversely affect our ability\nto access capital to fund our operations, meet our obligations and make distributions to our stockholders.\n142\nTable of Contents\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required\nto be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosures. An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n143\nTable of Contents\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under Part I., Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\n144\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nCommon Stock\nIn February 2022, the Board of Directors approved a $200.0 million common stock repurchase program. In March 2023, the Board of Directors\napproved an upsize of the common stock repurchase program to $246.0 million. The program, which expires March 31, 2025, allows the Company to make\nrepurchases of shares of common stock, from time to time, in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions or block trades or other means,\nin accordance with applicable securities laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Subject to applicable securities laws, repurchases of the Company's\ncommon stock under the common stock repurchase program may be made at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate, using available cash resources. The\ntiming and extent to which we repurchase our common stock will depend upon, among other things, market conditions, the share price of the Company's\ncommon stock, liquidity, regulatory requirements and other factors, and common stock repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior\nnotice. Shares of the Company's common stock repurchased by us under the common stock repurchase program are cancelled and, until reissued by us, are\ndeemed to be authorized but unissued shares of the Company's common stock.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock pursuant to the common stock\nrepurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, $189.7 million of the approved amount remained available for the repurchase of shares of the Company's\ncommon stock under the common stock repurchase program.\nPreferred Stock\nIn March 2023, the Board of Directors approved a $100.0 million preferred stock repurchase program. The program, which expires March 31, 2025,\nallows the Company to make repurchases of shares of preferred stock, from time to time, in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions\nor block trades or other means, in accordance with applicable securities laws and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its preferred stock pursuant to the preferred stock\nrepurchase program. As of September 30, 2024, $97.6 million of the approved amount remained available for the repurchase of shares of preferred stock under\nthe preferred stock repurchase program.\n145\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

To the extent vested, each DSU represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock of the Company,\nhereafter described as a “Share,” subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, this Agreement, the Plan and, if\napplicable, the Deferral Form. Unless and until the DSUs have vested and been settled in the manner described herein, the Participant\nwill have no right to receive any Shares or other payments in respect of the DSUs, except as otherwise specifically provided for in the\nPlan or this Agreement. Prior to settlement of this Award, the DSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company,\npayable only from the general assets of the Company.\nExhibit A-1\n2. Vesting of DSUs; Change in Control. Except as otherwise set forth in the following sentence or Section 3(a), the DSUs\nshall vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the Grant Notice. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as\ndefined in the Plan), any unvested DSUs shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the date of the Change in Control and\nshall be eligible for settlement in accordance with the first sentence of Section 5. Unless and until the DSUs have vested as described\nabove, the Participant will have no right to receive any dividends or other distribution (or other rights of ownership) with respect to\nthe Shares underlying the DSUs; provided, however, nothing in this Section 2 is intended to alter the Participant’s right to receive\ndividend equivalents pursuant and subject to Section 4. Fractional Shares shall not vest hereunder, and when any provision hereof may\ncause a fractional Share to vest, any vesting in such fractional Share shall be postponed until such fractional Share and other fractional\nShares equal a vested whole Share.\n3. Effect of Termination of Service.\n(a) Termination of Service Relationship due to Death or Disability. If the Participant’s service relationship with the\nCompany or any Affiliate is terminated due to the death of the Participant, any unvested DSUs shall become fully vested and non-\nforfeitable upon the date of death and shall be settled in accordance with the second sentence of Section 5. If the Participant’s service\nrelationship with the Company or any Affiliate is terminated due to Disability of the Participant, any unvested DSUs shall become\nfully vested and non-forfeitable upon the date of the termination of the Participant’s service relationship and shall be settled in\naccordance with the second sentence of Section 5. For purposes of this Agreement, “Disability” shall mean that the Participant is\npermanently and totally disabled within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.\n(b) Other Termination of Service.

Dividend Equivalents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each DSU subject to this Award is\nhereby granted in tandem with a corresponding dividend equivalent (“DER”), which DER shall remain outstanding from the Date of\nGrant until the earlier of the settlement or forfeiture of the DSU to which the DER corresponds. Each vested DER entitles the\nParticipant to receive payments, subject to and in accordance with this Agreement, in an amount equal to any dividends paid by the\nCompany in respect of the Share underlying the DSU to which such DER relates. The Company shall establish, with respect to each\nunvested DSU, a separate DER bookkeeping account for such DSU (a “DER Account”), which shall be credited (without interest) on\nthe applicable dividend payment dates with an amount equal to any dividends paid during the period that such unvested DSU remains\noutstanding with respect to the Share underlying the DSU to which such DER relates. Upon the date that the DSU becomes vested, the\nDER (and the DER Account) with respect to such vested DSU shall become vested. Similarly, upon the forfeiture of a DSU, the DSU\n(and the DER Account) with respect to such forfeited DSU shall also be forfeited. Payment of credited amounts in the DER Account\nwith respect to any vested DERs that relate to vested DSUs that have not yet been settled in accordance with Section 5 shall be made\nas soon as practicable, and within sixty (60) days, after the date that such DER vests. Following vesting of the DSUs under Section 2\nor 3 but prior to the settlement of such vested DSUs in accordance with Section 5, amounts shall no longer be credited to the DER\nAccount but instead each vested DER shall entitle the Participant to receive payments of any dividends paid by the Company in\nrespect of the Share underlying the vested DSU to which such vested DER relates, such payment to be made on or promptly following\nthe date that the Company pays such dividend. The Participant shall not be entitled to receive any interest with respect to the payment\nof DERs. DERs shall not entitle the Participant to any payments relating to the dividends paid after the earlier to occur of the date that\nthe applicable vested DSU is settled in accordance with Section 5 or the forfeiture of the DSU underlying such DER. The DERs and\nany amounts that may become payable in respect thereof will be treated separately from the DSUs for purposes of Section 409A of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the guidance and regulations promulgated thereunder and successor\nprovisions, guidance and regulations thereto (“Section 409A”) (including for the designation of the time and form of payments\nrequired by Section 409A).\n5.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or the Deferral Form (if applicable), following\nany termination of the Participant’s service relationship with the Company or an Affiliate under Section 3, the Company shall deliver\nto the Participant a number of Shares equal to such number of vested DSUs (if any) as soon as practicable following the applicable\ndate of termination but in no event later than sixty (60) days after such date of termination. All Shares issued hereunder shall be\ndelivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares to the Participant or by entering such Shares in book-entry\nform, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion The value of Shares shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of\ntime.

As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or\nthe Participant’s legal representative, heir, legatee or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a\nrelease and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided, however, that any review period under such\nrelease will not modify the date of settlement with respect to vested DSUs.\nA-4\n10. No Right to Continued Service or Awards.

Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company.\n11. Legal and Equitable Remedies. The Participant acknowledges that a violation or attempted breach of any of the\nParticipant's covenants and agreements in this Agreement will cause such damage as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which\nwould be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the\nCompany and its Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction,\nrestraining the Participant or the affiliates, partners or agents of the Participant from such breach or attempted violation of such\ncovenants and agreements, as well as to recover from the Participant any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the\nCompany or any Affiliate in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees.

(Nasdaq: NYMT) (“NYMT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) today reported results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Summary of****Third****Quarter****2024****:**_(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)_\n\nNet income attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| 32,410  \n---|---|---  \nNet income attributable to Company's common stockholders per share (basic)| $| 0.36  \nUndepreciated earnings(1)| $| 34,941  \nUndepreciated earnings per common share(1)| $| 0.39  \nComprehensive income attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| 32,410  \nComprehensive income attributable to Company's common stockholders per share (basic)| $| 0.36  \nYield on average interest earning assets(1) (2)| 6.69| %  \nInterest income| $| 108,361  \nInterest expense| $| 88,124  \nNet interest income| $| 20,237  \nNet interest spread(1) (3)| 1.32| %  \nBook value per common share at the end of the period| $| 9.83  \nAdjusted book value per common share at the end of the period(1)| $| 10.87  \nEconomic return on book value(4)| 3.51| %  \nEconomic return on adjusted book value(5)| 0.45| %  \nDividends per common share| $| 0.20  \n  \n(1)| Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below in \"Reconciliation of Financial Information.\"  \n---|---  \n(2)| Calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our average interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company.  \n(3)| Our calculation of net interest spread may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies who may use a different calculation.  \n(4)| Economic return on book value is based on the periodic change in GAAP book value per common share plus dividends declared per common share, if any, during the period.  \n(5)| Economic return on adjusted book value is based on the periodic change in adjusted book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure, plus dividends declared per common share, if any, during the period.  \n  \n**Key****Developments:**\n\nInvesting Activities\n\n  * A joint venture in which we held a common equity investment sold its multi-family apartment community for approximately $56.4 million. The sale generated a net gain attributable to the Company's common stockholders of approximately $8.7 million.\n\n\n  * A joint venture in which we hold a combined preferred equity and common equity investment sold a multi-family apartment community for approximately $43.5 million. The sale generated a net gain attributable to the Company's common stockholders of approximately $1.5 million.\n\n\n  * Purchased approximately $372.2 million of Agency RMBS with an average coupon of 5.33%.\n\n\n  * Purchased approximately $624.2 million in residential loans with an average gross coupon of 9.72%.\n\n\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n  * Completed a securitization of business purpose loans, resulting in approximately $235.8 million in net proceeds to us after deducting expenses associated with the transaction. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $184.6 million on outstanding repurchase agreements related to residential loans.\n\n\n  * Completed a re-securitization of our investment in certain subordinated securities issued by Consolidated SLST, resulting in approximately $73.0 million in net proceeds to us after deducting expenses associated with the transaction. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $48.8 million on outstanding repurchase agreement financing related to our investment in Consolidated SLST.\n\n\n\n**Management Overview**\n\nJason Serrano, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"The Company reported sharply higher earnings per share of $0.36 in the third quarter. The improved earnings were the result of a portfolio rotation which began over a year ago. As part of the plan, we focused on acquisitions that can deliver high recurring interest income by rotating from under-performing, total return opportunities. Consequently, the Company reported Total Adjusted Net Interest Income of $29 million in the third quarter, up 39% year-over-year.\n\nOver the year, we maintained a deliberate approach to balance sheet growth by prioritizing investments containing fundamentally stable income and did not veer from our objective. Going forward, we intend to unlock the Company’s excess liquidity for continued portfolio growth to further enhance Company earnings, particularly without any corporate debt maturity until 2026. We believe a patient approach for earnings growth is prudent in this market environment to increase stockholder value.\"\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nThe following table sets forth, by investment category, our allocated capital at September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n**Single-Family****(1)**| **Multi-****Family**| **Corporate/Other**| **Total**  \n---|---|---|---  \nResidential loans| $| 3,777,144| $| —| $| —| $| 3,777,144  \nConsolidated SLST CDOs| (845,811| )| —| —| (845,811| )  \nInvestment securities available for sale| 3,036,182| —| 349,088| 3,385,270  \nMulti-family loans| —| 87,614| —| 87,614  \nEquity investments| —| 100,378| 46,455| 146,833  \nEquity investments in consolidated multi-family properties(2)| —| 154,462| —| 154,462  \nEquity investments in disposal group held for sale(3)| —| 17,831| —| 17,831  \nSingle-family rental properties| 144,736| —| —| 144,736  \nTotal investment portfolio carrying value| 6,112,251| 360,285| 395,543| 6,868,079  \nLiabilities:  \nRepurchase agreements| (3,258,175| )| —| (352,940| )| (3,611,115| )  \nCollateralized debt obligations  \nResidential loan securitization CDOs| (1,883,817| )| —| —| (1,883,817| )  \nNon-Agency RMBS re-securitization| (72,638| )| —| —| (72,638| )  \nSenior unsecured notes| —| —| (159,587| )| (159,587| )  \nSubordinated debentures| —| —| (45,000| )| (45,000| )  \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(4)| 104,220| —| 221,582| 325,802  \nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| —| (48,282| )| —| (48,282| )  \nOther| 111,504| (1,306| )| (39,493| )| 70,705  \nNet Company capital allocated| $| 1,113,345| $| 310,697| $| 20,105| $| 1,444,147  \nCompany Recourse Leverage Ratio(5)| 2.6x  \nPortfolio Recourse Leverage Ratio(6)| 2.5x  \n  \n(1)| The Company, through its ownership of certain securities, has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Consolidated SLST and has consolidated the assets and liabilities of Consolidated SLST in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Average Interest Bearing Liabilities is calculated based on the daily average outstanding balance for the period.  \n(5)| Yield on Average Interest Earning Assets is calculated by dividing our annualized adjusted interest income relating to our portfolio of interest earning assets by our Average Interest Earning Assets for the period.  \n(6)| Average Financing Cost is calculated by dividing our annualized adjusted interest expense by our Average Interest Bearing Liabilities.  \n(7)| Net Interest Spread is the difference between our Yield on Average Interest Earning Assets and our Average Financing Cost.  \n(8)| The Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Consolidated SLST and has consolidated Consolidated SLST into the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. Our GAAP interest income includes interest income recognized on the underlying seasoned re-performing and non-performing residential loans held in Consolidated SLST. Our GAAP interest expense includes interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs that permanently finance the residential loans in Consolidated SLST and are not owned by the Company. We calculate adjusted interest income by reducing our GAAP interest income by the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted interest expense by excluding, among other things, the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs, thus only including the interest income earned by the SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company in adjusted net interest income.  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nOn Thursday, October 31, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, New York Mortgage Trust's executive management is scheduled to host a conference call and audio webcast to discuss the Company’s financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below in \"Reconciliation of Financial Information.\"  \n---|---  \n  \n**Reconciliation of Financial Information**\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted interest income, adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income (loss), yield on average interest earning assets, average financing cost, net interest spread, undepreciated earnings (loss) and adjusted book value per common share. Our management team believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provide supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current performance and trends using the metrics that management uses to operate our business. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\n\n_Adjusted_ _Net Interest Income (Loss) and Net Interest Spread_\n\nFinancial results for the Company during a given period include the net interest income earned on our investment portfolio of residential loans, investment securities and preferred equity investments and mezzanine loans, where the risks and payment characteristics are equivalent to and accounted for as loans (collectively, our “interest earning assets”). Adjusted net interest income (loss) and net interest spread (both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures) are impacted by factors such as our cost of financing, including our hedging costs, and the interest rate that our investments bear. Furthermore, the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased investments and the prepayment rates on investments will impact adjusted net interest income (loss) as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments.\n\nWe provide the following non-GAAP financial measures, in total and by investment category, for the respective periods:\n\n  * adjusted interest income – calculated as our GAAP interest income reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs,\n  * adjusted interest expense – calculated as our GAAP interest expense reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted to include the net interest component of interest rate swaps,\n  * adjusted net interest income (loss) – calculated by subtracting adjusted interest expense from adjusted interest income,\n  * yield on average interest earning assets – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our average interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company,\n  * average financing cost – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest expense and the average outstanding balance of our interest bearing liabilities, excluding Consolidated SLST CDOs and mortgages payable on real estate, and\n  * net interest spread – calculated as the difference between our yield on average interest earning assets and our average financing cost.\n\n\n\nThese measures remove the impact of Consolidated SLST that we consolidate in accordance with GAAP and include the net interest component of interest rate swaps utilized to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings, which is included in (losses) gains on derivative instruments, net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. With respect to Consolidated SLST, we only include the interest income earned by the Consolidated SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company as the Company only receives income or absorbs losses related to the Consolidated SLST securities actually owned by the Company. We include the net interest component of interest rate swaps in these measures to more fully represent the cost of our financing strategy.\n\nWe provide the non-GAAP financial measures listed above because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with additional detail and enhance their understanding of our interest earning asset yields, in total and by investment category, relative to the cost of our financing and the underlying trends within our portfolio of interest earning assets. In addition to the foregoing, our management team uses these measures to assess, among other things, the performance of our interest earning assets in total and by asset, possible cash flows from our interest earning assets in total and by asset, our ability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing and the composition of our portfolio of interest earning assets, including acquisition and disposition determinations.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP interest income to adjusted interest income, GAAP interest expense to adjusted interest expense and GAAP total net

\n---|---  \n  \n_Undepreciated Earnings (Loss)_\n\nUndepreciated earnings (loss) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders excluding the Company's share in depreciation expense and lease intangible amortization expense, if any, related to operating real estate, net for which an impairment has not been recognized. By excluding these non-cash adjustments from our operating results, we believe that the presentation of undepreciated earnings (loss) provides a consistent measure of our operating performance and useful information to investors to evaluate the effective net return on our portfolio. In addition, we believe that presenting undepreciated earnings (loss) enables our investors to measure, evaluate, and compare our operating performance to that of our peers.\n\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders to undepreciated earnings (loss) for the respective periods ended is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet income (loss) attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| 32,410| $| (26,028| )| $| (68,340| )| $| 31,465| $| (94,819| )  \nAdd:  \nDepreciation expense on operating real estate| 2,531| 3,698| 6,326| 2,232| 2,182  \nUndepreciated earnings (loss)| $| 34,941| $| (22,330| )| $| (62,014| )| $| 33,697| $| (92,637| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic| 90,582| 90,989| 91,117| 90,683| 90,984  \nUndepreciated earnings (loss) per common share| $| 0.39| $| (0.25| )| $| (0.68| )| $| 0.37| $| (1.02| )  \n  \n_Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share_\n\nAdjusted book value per common share is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by making the following adjustments to GAAP book value: (i) exclude the Company's share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, (ii) exclude the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value and (iii) adjust our amortized cost liabilities that finance our investment portfolio to fair value.\n\nOur rental property portfolio includes fee simple interests in single-family rental homes and joint venture equity interests in multi-family properties owned by Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. By excluding our share of cumulative non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, adjusted book value reflects the value, at their undepreciated basis, of our single-family rental properties and joint venture equity investments that the Company has determined to be recoverable at the end of the period.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with third party ownership of certain of the non-controlling interests in certain of the Consolidated Real Estate VIEs, we record redeemable non-controlling interests as mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling interests may elect to sell their ownership interests to us at fair value once a year, subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, resulting in an adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value that is accounted for by us as an equity transaction in accordance with GAAP. A key component of the estimation of fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests is the estimated fair value of the multi-family apartment properties held by the applicable Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. However, because the corresponding real estate assets are not reported at fair value and thus not adjusted to reflect unrealized gains or losses in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the cumulative adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value directly affects our GAAP book value. By excluding the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value, adjusted book value more closely aligns the accounting treatment applied to these real estate assets and reflects our joint venture equity investment at its undepreciated basis.\n\nThe substantial majority of our remaining assets are financial or similar instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option in our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, unlike our use of the fair value option for the assets in our investment portfolio, certain CDOs issued by our residential loan securitizations, certain senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures that finance our investment portfolio assets are carried at amortized cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. By adjusting these financing instruments to fair value, adjusted book value reflects the Company's net equity in investments on a comparable fair value basis.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted book value per common share provides a useful measure for investors and us as it provides a consistent measure of our value, allows management to effectively consider our financial position and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to that of our peers.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP book value to adjusted book value and calculation of adjusted book value per common share as of the dates indicated is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**| **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCompany's stockholders' equity| $| 1,444,147| $| 1,431,910| $| 1,485,256| $| 1,579,612| $| 1,575,228  \nPreferred stock liquidation preference| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (554,110| )  \nGAAP book value| 890,037| 877,800| 931,146| 1,025,502| 1,021,118  \nAdd:  \nCumulative depreciation expense on real estate(1)| 19,180| 21,692| 24,451| 21,801| 21,817  \nCumulative amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate(1)| 4,903| 11,078| 13,000| 14,897| 21,356  \nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| 48,282| 44,053| 36,489| 30,062| 17,043  \nAdjustment of amortized cost liabilities to fair value| 21,961| 43,475| 44,590| 55,271| 90,929  \nAdjusted book value| $| 984,363| $| 998,098| $| 1,049,676| $| 1,147,533| $| 1,172,263  \nCommon shares outstanding| 90,579| 90,592| 91,231| 90,675| 90,684  \nGAAP book value per common share(2)| $| 9.83| $| 9.69| $| 10.21| $| 11.31| $| 11.26  \nAdjusted book value per common share(3)| $| 10.87| $| 11.02| $| 11.51| $| 12.66| $| 12.93  \n  \n(1)| Represents cumulative adjustments for the Company's share of depreciation expense and amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate held as of the end of the period presented for which an impairment has not been recognized.  \n---|---  \n(2)| GAAP book value per common share is calculated using the GAAP book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.  \n(3)| Adjusted book value per common share is calculated using the adjusted book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.  \n  \n**_Equity Investments in Multi-Family Entities_**\n\nWe own joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family properties. We determined that these joint venture entities are VIEs and that we are the primary beneficiary of all but two of these VIEs, resulting in consolidation of the VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, including their assets, liabilities, income and expenses, in our condensed consolidated financial statements with non-controlling interests for the third-party ownership of the joint ventures' membership interests. With respect to the two additional joint venture equity investments for which we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary, we record our equity investments at fair value.\n\nIn September 2022, the Company announced a repositioning of its business through the opportunistic disposition over time of the Company's joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties and reallocation of its capital away from such assets to its targeted assets. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that certain joint venture equity investments meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs are reported in assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale.\n\nWe also own a preferred equity investment in a VIE that owns a multi-family property and for which, as of September 30, 2024, the Company is the primary beneficiary, resulting in consolidation of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the VIE in our condensed consolidated financial statements with a non-controlling interest for the third-party ownership of the VIE's membership interests.\n\nA reconciliation of our net equity investments in consolidated multi-family properties and disposal group held for sale to our condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 is shown below (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nCash and cash equivalents| $| 6,194  \n---|---|---  \nReal estate, net(1)| 610,967  \nAssets of disposal group held for sale| 197,665  \nOther assets| 21,981  \nTotal assets| $| 836,807  \nMortgages payable on real estate, net| $| 492,321  \nLiabilities of disposal group held for sale| 177,869  \nOther liabilities| 14,917  \nTotal liabilities| $| 685,107  \nRedeemable non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs| $| 21,826  \nLess: Cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| (48,282| )  \nNon-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs| 3,899  \nNon-controlling interest in disposal group held for sale| 1,964  \nNet equity investment(2)| $| 172,293  \n  \n(1)|  Includes real estate held for sale in the amount of $23.6 million.  \n---|---  \n(2)|  The Company's net equity investment as of September 30, 2024 consists of $154.5 million of net equity investments in consolidated multi-family properties and $17.8 million of net equity investments in disposal group held for sale.  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NDg1MCM2NTU1ODU2IzIwMTkwMTA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ODU4NTI3NjYtNWM5OC00NmM0LWEwN2ItNzYxZDIwYjc5YWMxLTEwMzA1ODM=/tiny/New-York-Mortgage-Trust-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/8b301801-e1c9-4019-8da4-3d24e14e183b/small/transparent-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8b301801-e1c9-4019-8da4-3d24e14e183b)\n\nSource: New York Mortgage Trust, Inc.\n\n[Back to News](/news)\n"

(Nasdaq: NYMT) (“NYMT,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) today reported results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Summary of****Second****Quarter****2024****:**_(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)_\n\nNet loss attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| (26,028| )  \n---|---|---|---  \nNet loss attributable to Company's common stockholders per share (basic)| $| (0.29| )  \nUndepreciated loss (1)| $| (22,330| )  \nUndepreciated loss per common share (1)| $| (0.25| )  \nComprehensive loss attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| (26,028| )  \nComprehensive loss attributable to Company's common stockholders per share (basic)| $| (0.29| )  \nYield on average interest earning assets (1) (2)| 6.46| %  \nInterest income| $| 90,775  \nInterest expense| $| 71,731  \nNet interest income| $| 19,044  \nNet interest spread (1) (3)| 1.33| %  \nBook value per common share at the end of the period| $| 9.69  \nAdjusted book value per common share at the end of the period (1)| $| 11.02  \nEconomic return on book value (4)| (3.13| )%  \nEconomic return on adjusted book value (5)| (2.52| )%  \nDividends per common share| $| 0.20  \n  \n(1)| Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below in \"Reconciliation of Financial Information.\"  \n---|---  \n(2)| Calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our average interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company.  \n(3)| Our calculation of net interest spread may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies who may use a different calculation.  \n(4)| Economic return on book value is based on the periodic change in GAAP book value per common share plus dividends declared per common share, if any, during the period.  \n(5)| Economic return on adjusted book value is based on the periodic change in adjusted book value per common share, a non-GAAP financial measure, plus dividends declared per common share, if any, during the period.  \n  \n**Key Developments:**\n\nInvesting Activities\n\n  * Purchased approximately $467.5 million of Agency RMBS with an average coupon of 6.00%. \n  * Purchased approximately $420.7 million in residential loans with an average gross coupon of 10.42%.\n\n\n\nFinancing Activities\n\n  * Completed a securitization of business purpose loans, resulting in approximately $241.6 million in net proceeds to us after deducting expenses associated with the transaction. We utilized a portion of the net proceeds to repay approximately $163.6 million on outstanding repurchase agreements related to residential loans.\n  * Repurchased 587,347 shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 million at an accretive average repurchase price of $5.95 per common share. \n  * Completed the issuance of $60.0 million of 9.125% Senior Notes due 2029 in an underwritten public offering at par, resulting in approximately $57.5 million in net proceeds to us after deducting the underwriters' discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\n\n\n\n**Management Overview**\n\nJason Serrano, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Recent interest rate market activity is falling in line with moderating inflation and an expected slowing of the economy, as evidenced by a 29 basis point decline in the 2-year Treasury yield from its second quarter peak. In anticipation of these events, we continued our capital rotation plan to divest from lower current yield portfolio assets while simultaneously utilizing excess liquidity to raise Company recurring income. This resulted in second quarter Adjusted Interest Income of $84 million, a 63% increase from the same period in 2023. With potential excess liquidity of $424 million, or 42% of NYMT’s market capitalization at the end of the second quarter, we are focused on meaningfully raising current income in subsequent quarters.\n\nWe are excited about the opportunity for continued portfolio growth while also optimizing expenses over the second half of 2024. We seek to maintain flexibility by remaining short duration in credit assets and liquid in Agency RMBS to capture investment opportunities if a distressed market environment materializes. We believe that the flexibility provided by our excess liquidity and portfolio composition in shifting market conditions will be vital to Company outperformance over the coming years.\"\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nThe following table sets forth, by investment category, our allocated capital at June 30, 2024 (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\n**Single-Family****(1)**| **Multi-****Family**| **Corporate/Other**| **Total**  \n---|---|---|---  \nResidential loans| $| 3,503,191| $| —| $| —| $| 3,503,191  \nConsolidated SLST CDOs| (844,032| )| —| —| (844,032| )  \nInvestment securities available for sale| 2,672,079| —| —| 2,672,079  \nMulti-family loans| —| 92,997| —| 92,997  \nEquity investments| —| 104,071| 38,844| 142,915  \nEquity investments in consolidated multi-family properties (2)| —| 171,406| —| 171,406  \nEquity investments in disposal group held for sale (3)| —| 30,434| —| 30,434  \nSingle-family rental properties| 147,494| —| —| 147,494  \nTotal investment portfolio carrying value| 5,478,732| 398,908| 38,844| 5,916,484  \nLiabilities:  \nRepurchase agreements| (2,952,289| )| —| —| (2,952,289| )  \nResidential loan securitization CDOs| (1,705,468| )| —| —| (1,705,468| )  \nSenior unsecured notes| —| —| (158,492| )| (158,492| )  \nSubordinated debentures| —| —| (45,000| )| (45,000| )  \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (4)| 127,343| —| 232,439| 359,782  \nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| —| (44,053| )| —| (44,053| )  \nOther| 98,617| (2,753| )| (34,918| )| 60,946  \nNet Company capital allocated| $| 1,046,935| $| 352,102| $| 32,873| $| 1,431,910  \nCompany Recourse Leverage Ratio (5)| 2.1x  \nPortfolio Recourse Leverage Ratio (6)| 2.0x  \n  \n(1)| The Company, through its ownership of certain securities, has determined it is the primary beneficiary of Consolidated SLST and has consolidated the assets and liabilities of Consolidated SLST in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Our GAAP interest expense includes interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs that permanently finance the residential loans in Consolidated SLST and are not owned by the Company. We calculate adjusted interest income by reducing our GAAP interest income by the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted interest expense by excluding, among other things, the interest expense recognized on the Consolidated SLST CDOs, thus only including the interest income earned by the SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company in adjusted net interest income.  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nOn Thursday, August 1, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Time, New York Mortgage Trust's executive management is scheduled to host a conference call and audio webcast to discuss the Company’s financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.

A reconciliation of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measure is included below in \"Reconciliation of Financial Information.\"  \n---|---  \n  \n**Reconciliation of Financial Information**\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted interest income, adjusted interest expense, adjusted net interest income (loss), yield on average interest earning assets, average financing cost, net interest spread, undepreciated (loss) earnings and adjusted book value per common share. Our management team believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered with our GAAP financial statements, provide supplemental information useful for investors as it enables them to evaluate our current performance and trends using the metrics that management uses to operate our business. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies, who may use different calculations. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP should be carefully evaluated.\n\n_Adjusted_ _Net Interest Income (Loss) and Net Interest Spread_\n\nFinancial results for the Company during a given period include the net interest income earned on our investment portfolio of residential loans, RMBS, CMBS, ABS and preferred equity investments and mezzanine loans, where the risks and payment characteristics are equivalent to and accounted for as loans (collectively, our “interest earning assets”). Adjusted net interest income (loss) and net interest spread (both supplemental non-GAAP financial measures) are impacted by factors such as our cost of financing, including our hedging costs, and the interest rate that our investments bear. Furthermore, the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased investments and the prepayment rates on investments will impact adjusted net interest income (loss) as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments.\n\nWe provide the following non-GAAP financial measures, in total and by investment category, for the respective periods:\n\n  * adjusted interest income – calculated as our GAAP interest income reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs,\n  * adjusted interest expense – calculated as our GAAP interest expense reduced by the interest expense recognized on Consolidated SLST CDOs and adjusted to include the net interest component of interest rate swaps,\n  * adjusted net interest income (loss) – calculated by subtracting adjusted interest expense from adjusted interest income,\n  * yield on average interest earning assets – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest income and our average interest earning assets and excludes all Consolidated SLST assets other than those securities owned by the Company,\n  * average financing cost – calculated as the quotient of our adjusted interest expense and the average outstanding balance of our interest bearing liabilities, excluding Consolidated SLST CDOs and mortgages payable on real estate, and\n  * net interest spread – calculated as the difference between our yield on average interest earning assets and our average financing cost.\n\n\n\nThese measures remove the impact of Consolidated SLST that we consolidate in accordance with GAAP and include the net interest component of interest rate swaps utilized to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our variable-rate borrowings, which is included in gains on derivative instruments, net in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations. With respect to Consolidated SLST, we only include the interest income earned by the Consolidated SLST securities that are actually owned by the Company as the Company only receives income or absorbs losses related to the Consolidated SLST securities actually owned by the Company. We include the net interest component of interest rate swaps in these measures to more fully represent the cost of our financing strategy.\n\nWe provide the non-GAAP financial measures listed above because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with additional detail and enhance their understanding of our interest earning asset yields, in total and by investment category, relative to the cost of our financing and the underlying trends within our portfolio of interest earning assets. In addition to the foregoing, our management team uses these measures to assess, among other things, the performance of our interest earning assets in total and by asset, possible cash flows from our interest earning assets in total and by asset, our ability to finance or borrow against the asset and the terms of such financing and the composition of our portfolio of interest earning assets, including acquisition and disposition determinations.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP interest income to adjusted interest income, GAAP interest expense to adjusted interest expense and GAAP total net

(Loss) Earnings_\n\nUndepreciated (loss) earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure defined as GAAP net (loss) income attributable to Company's common stockholders excluding the Company's share in depreciation expense and lease intangible amortization expense, if any, related to operating real estate, net for which an impairment has not been recognized. By excluding these non-cash adjustments from our operating results, we believe that the presentation of undepreciated (loss) earnings provides a consistent measure of our operating performance and useful information to investors to evaluate the effective net return on our portfolio. In addition, we believe that presenting undepreciated (loss) earnings enables our investors to measure, evaluate, and compare our operating performance to that of our peers.\n\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to Company's common stockholders to undepreciated (loss) earnings for the respective periods ended is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**June 30 , 2024**| **March 31 , 2024**| **December 31 , 2023**| **September 30 , 2023**| **June 30 , 2023**  \nNet (loss) income attributable to Company's common stockholders| $| (26,028| )| $| (68,340| )| $| 31,465| $| (94,819| )| $| (37,202| )  \nAdd:  \nDepreciation expense on operating real estate| 3,698| 6,326| 2,232| 2,182| 2,180  \nUndepreciated (loss) earnings| $| (22,330| )| $| (62,014| )| $| 33,697| $| (92,637| )| $| (35,022| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic| 90,989| 91,117| 90,683| 90,984| 91,193  \nUndepreciated (loss) earnings per common share| $| (0.25| )| $| (0.68| )| $| 0.37| $| (1.02| )| $| (0.38| )  \n  \n_Adjusted Book Value Per Common Share_\n\nAdjusted book value per common share is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure calculated by making the following adjustments to GAAP book value: (i) exclude the Company's share of cumulative depreciation and lease intangible amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, (ii) exclude the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value and (iii) adjust our amortized cost liabilities that finance our investment portfolio to fair value.\n\nOur rental property portfolio includes fee simple interests in single-family rental homes and joint venture equity interests in multi-family properties owned by Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. By excluding our share of cumulative non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses related to real estate held at the end of the period for which an impairment has not been recognized, adjusted book value reflects the value, at their undepreciated basis, of our single-family rental properties and joint venture equity investments that the Company has determined to be recoverable at the end of the period.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with third party ownership of certain of the non-controlling interests in certain of the Consolidated Real Estate VIEs, we record redeemable non-controlling interests as mezzanine equity on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The holders of the redeemable non-controlling interests may elect to sell their ownership interests to us at fair value once a year, subject to annual minimum and maximum amount limitations, resulting in an adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value that is accounted for by us as an equity transaction in accordance with GAAP. A key component of the estimation of fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interests is the estimated fair value of the multi-family apartment properties held by the applicable Consolidated Real Estate VIEs. However, because the corresponding real estate assets are not reported at fair value and thus not adjusted to reflect unrealized gains or losses in our condensed consolidated financial statements, the cumulative adjustment of the redeemable non-controlling interests to fair value directly affects our GAAP book value. By excluding the cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interests to estimated redemption value, adjusted book value more closely aligns the accounting treatment applied to these real estate assets and reflects our joint venture equity investment at its undepreciated basis.\n\nThe substantial majority of our remaining assets are financial or similar instruments that are carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value option in our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, unlike our use of the fair value option for the assets in our investment portfolio, certain CDOs issued by our residential loan securitizations, certain senior unsecured notes and subordinated debentures that finance our investment portfolio assets are carried at amortized cost in our condensed consolidated financial statements. By adjusting these financing instruments to fair value, adjusted book value reflects the Company's net equity in investments on a comparable fair value basis. \n\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted book value per common share provides a useful measure for investors and us as it provides a consistent measure of our value, allows management to effectively consider our financial position and facilitates the comparison of our financial performance to that of our peers.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP book value to adjusted book value and calculation of adjusted book value per common share as of the dates indicated is presented below (amounts in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**June 30 , 2024**| **March 31 , 2024**| **December 31 , 2023**| **September 30 , 2023**| **June 30 , 2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nCompany's stockholders' equity| $| 1,431,910| $| 1,485,256| $| 1,579,612| $| 1,575,228| $| 1,690,712  \nPreferred stock liquidation preference| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (554,110| )| (555,699| )  \nGAAP book value| 877,800| 931,146| 1,025,502| 1,021,118| 1,135,013  \nAdd:  \nCumulative depreciation expense on real estate (1)| 21,692| 24,451| 21,801| 21,817| 23,157  \nCumulative amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate (1)| 11,078| 13,000| 14,897| 21,356| 30,843  \nCumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| 44,053| 36,489| 30,062| 17,043| 27,640  \nAdjustment of amortized cost liabilities to fair value| 43,475| 44,590| 55,271| 90,929| 90,129  \nAdjusted book value| $| 998,098| $| 1,049,676| $| 1,147,533| $| 1,172,263| $| 1,306,782  \nCommon shares outstanding| 90,592| 91,231| 90,675| 90,684| 91,250  \nGAAP book value per common share (2)| $| 9.69| $| 10.21| $| 11.31| $| 11.26| $| 12.44  \nAdjusted book value per common share (3)| $| 11.02| $| 11.51| $| 12.66| $| 12.93| $| 14.32  \n  \n(1)| Represents cumulative adjustments for the Company's share of depreciation expense and amortization of lease intangibles related to real estate held as of the end of the period presented for which an impairment has not been recognized.  \n---|---  \n(2)| GAAP book value per common share is calculated using the GAAP book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.  \n(3)| Adjusted book value per common share is calculated using the adjusted book value and the common shares outstanding for the periods indicated.  \n  \n**_Equity Investments in Multi-Family Entities_**\n\nWe own joint venture equity investments in entities that own multi-family properties. We determined that these joint venture entities are VIEs and that we are the primary beneficiary of all but two of these VIEs, resulting in consolidation of the VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary, including their assets, liabilities, income and expenses, in our condensed consolidated financial statements with non-controlling interests for the third-party ownership of the joint ventures' membership interests. With respect to the two additional joint venture equity investments for which we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary, we record our equity investments at fair value.\n\nIn September 2022, the Company announced a repositioning of its business through the opportunistic disposition over time of the Company's joint venture equity investments in multi-family properties and reallocation of its capital away from such assets to its targeted assets. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2024, the Company determined that certain joint venture equity investments meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale and the assets and liabilities of the respective Consolidated VIEs are reported in assets and liabilities of disposal group held for sale.\n\nWe also own a preferred equity investment in a VIE that owns a multi-family property and for which, as of June 30, 2024, the Company is the primary beneficiary, resulting in consolidation of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the VIE in our condensed consolidated financial statements with a non-controlling interest for the third-party ownership of the VIE's membership interests.\n\nA reconciliation of our net equity investments in consolidated multi-family properties and disposal group held for sale to our condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2024 is shown below (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nCash and cash equivalents| $| 8,368  \n---|---|---  \nReal estate, net (1)| 732,437  \nAssets of disposal group held for sale| 373,538  \nOther assets| 24,947  \nTotal assets| $| 1,139,290  \nMortgages payable on real estate, net| $| 592,919  \nLiabilities of disposal group held for sale| 340,138  \nOther liabilities| 15,730  \nTotal liabilities| $| 948,787  \nRedeemable non-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs| $| 23,088  \nLess: Cumulative adjustment of redeemable non-controlling interest to estimated redemption value| (44,053| )  \nNon-controlling interest in Consolidated VIEs| 6,662  \nNon-controlling interest in disposal group held for sale| 2,966  \nNet equity investment (2)| $| 201,840  \n  \n(1)| Includes real estate held for sale in the amount of $59.9 million.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The Company's net equity investment as of June 30, 2024 consists of $171.4 million of net equity investments in consolidated multi-family properties and $30.4 million of net equity investments in disposal group held for sale.  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5NjkyMSM2Mzk5OTk3IzIwMTkwMTA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/OTA4NTZjMjUtZGYwZC00ZDllLTg4NzktNzRkOGJiYjZmODA3LTEwMzA1ODM=/tiny/New-York-Mortgage-Trust-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/8b301801-e1c9-4019-8da4-3d24e14e183b/small/transparent-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8b301801-e1c9-4019-8da4-3d24e14e183b)\n\nSource: New York Mortgage Trust, Inc.\n\n[Back to News](/news)\n"
