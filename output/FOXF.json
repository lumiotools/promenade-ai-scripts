Reports Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nDULUTH, Ga., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fox Factory Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: FOXF) (“FOX” or the “Company”), a premium brand and a global leader in the design, engineering and manufacturing of performance-defining products and systems for customers worldwide, today reported financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024.\n\n**Third****Quarter Fiscal 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were****$359.1 million****, a sequential increase of****3.1%****and an****8.5%** **increase****over the prior year**\n  * **Revenue and earnings per diluted share within the low end of our guidance range**\n  * **Bike revenues grew****21.9%****sequentially, and****38.7%****over the prior year**\n  * **Executed $400 million in interest rate swap hedges to reduce interest expense and provide greater predictability**\n  * **Initiated strategic actions in AAG segment in third quarter aimed at improving inventory position**\n  * **Announced expanded cost optimization efforts targeting more than $25 million across enterprise to recapture margin amid challenged macroeconomic backdrop**\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“Although we delivered sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter, our OEM customers remained challenged due to broader market conditions impacting consumer discretionary spending, which pushed results towards the lower end of our expectations,” commented Mike Dennison, FOX's Chief Executive Officer. “We've responded decisively to these challenges by implementing both immediate and longer-term actions to strengthen our business, including aggressive cost management and strategic operational improvements. Importantly, underlying demand for FOX’s innovative products remains strong across our segments, particularly evident in our aftermarket channels where we continue to see growth.”\n\nMr. Dennison continued, “During the third quarter, we began developing and implementing plans across a series of key priorities, reflecting a commitment to adjust our business structure to operate efficiently in a number of demand environments so that we can protect margins and drive significant, and consistent, free cash flow to de-lever our balance sheet. We have initiated this strategy through swift actions in our AAG segment that we expect to improve margins in the fourth quarter, and are extending these efforts across our other business segments as well. We expect our combined efforts to result in more than $25 million of annualized cost reductions to strategically position ourselves to capitalize on opportunities as consumer demand accelerates in the future.”\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $359.1 million, an increase of 8.5%, as compared to net sales of $331.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This increase reflects a $77.5 million or 107.6% increase in Specialty Sports Group (“SSG”), partially offset by a $35.8 million or 26.3% decrease in Aftermarket Applications Group (“AAG”) and a $13.7 million or 11.2% decrease in Powered Vehicles Group (“PVG”). The increase in SSG net sales from $72.0 million to $149.5 million is primarily related to the inclusion of $49.6 million in net sales from Marucci, which we acquired in November 2023, and a $27.9 million increase in bike sales. Sequentially, bike revenues grew by 21.9%. Although bike sales improved compared to prior year, the ongoing channel inventory recalibration and, to a lesser extent, lower end consumer demand remain headwinds. The decrease in AAG net sales from $136.0 million to $100.3 million is driven by lower upfitting sales due to product mix, higher interest rates impacting dealers and consumers, and higher inventory levels at dealerships. The decrease in PVG net sales from $123.1 million to $109.3 million is primarily due to lower industry demand in power sports and automotive because of higher interest rates.\n\nGross margin was 29.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, a 250-basis point decrease from gross margin of 32.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by shifts in our product line mix and reduced operating leverage on lower volume. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes the effects of organizational restructuring expenses in the prior year, decreased 330 basis points to 29.9% from the same prior fiscal year period.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $88.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $65.9 million, or 19.9% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Operating expenses increased by $22.8 million primarily driven by the inclusion of Marucci operating expenses of $19.7 million. Adjusted operating expenses were $75.8 million, or 21.1% of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $58.3 million, or 17.6% of net sales, in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year.\n\nTax expense was $0.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to tax expense of $3.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in the Company’s income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $4.8 million, compared to net income of $35.3 million in the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.11, compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.83 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $14.8 million, or $0.35 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $44.8 million, or $1.05 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, in the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $42.0 million, compared to $63.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 11.7%, compared to 19.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\n**First****Nine Months****Fiscal 2024 Results**\n\nNet sales for the nine months ended September 27, 2024, were $1,041.1 million, a decrease of 8.0% compared to the first nine months in fiscal 2023. This decrease reflects a $121.1 million or 28.1% decrease in AAG net sales and a $60.3 million or 14.9% decrease in PVG net sales, partially offset by a $90.8 million or 30.7% increase in SSG net sales. The decrease in AAG net sales from $430.4 million to $309.3 million is driven by lower upfitting sales due to product mix, higher interest rates impacting dealers and consumers, and higher inventory level at dealerships. The decrease in PVG net sales from $405.5 million to $345.2 million is primarily due to lower industry demand in power sports and automotive because of higher interest rates. The increase in SSG sales from $295.8 million to $386.6 million is related to the inclusion of $150.8 million in net sales from Marucci, partially offset by a reduction in bike sales of $60.0 million because of the ongoing channel inventory recalibration and, to a lesser extent, lower end consumer demand.\n\nGross margin was 30.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a 200-basis point decrease, compared to gross margin of 32.9% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by shifts in our product line mix and operating leverage on lower volume. Adjusted gross margin, excluding the effects of the amortization of an acquired inventory valuation markup and organizational restructuring expenses, was 31.3% in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a 270-basis point decrease, compared to 34.0% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses were $275.3 million, or 26.4% of net sales, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to $223.7 million, or 19.8% of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Operating expenses increased by $51.6 million primarily due to the inclusion of Marucci operating expenses of $59.9 million, partially offset by cost controls. Adjusted operating expenses were $234.5 million, or 22.5% of net sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to $199.6 million, or 17.6% of net sales, in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year.\n\nNet income in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $6.7 million, compared to $116.8 million in the first nine months of the prior fiscal year. Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $0.16, compared to $2.75 in the same period of fiscal 2023. Adjusted net income in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $42.6 million, or $1.02 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, compared to $147.2 million, or $3.46 of adjusted earnings per diluted share in the same period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased to $126.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to $222.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin decrease to 12.2% in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to 19.6% in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\n\nReconciliations to non-GAAP measures are provided at the end of this press release.\n\n**Balance Sheet Summary**\n\nAs of September 27, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $89.2 million, compared to $83.6 million as of December 29, 2023. Inventory was $401.4 million as of September 27, 2024, compared to $371.8 million as of December 29, 2023. As of September 27, 2024, accounts receivable and accounts payable were $192.5 million and $134.6 million, respectively, compared to $171.1 million and $104.2 million, respectively, as of December 29, 2023. Prepaids and other current assets were $128.0 million as of September 27, 2024, compared to $141.5 million as of December 29, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to a decrease in prepaids and other current assets driven by lower chassis deposits as we worked to sell through model year 2024. Inventory increased by $29.5 million driven by timing and some seasonal inventory. The change in accounts receivable is due to higher sales in fiscal quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared to fiscal quarter ended December 29, 2023. The change in accounts payable reflects the timing of vendor payments. Total debt was $768.4 million as of September 27, 2024, compared to $743.5 million as of December 29, 2023.\n\n**Fourth Quarter and Fiscal****2024****Guidance**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company expects net sales in the range of $300 million to $340 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.40.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, the Company now expects net sales in the range of $1.341 billion to $1.381 billion, adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.27 to $1.42, and a full year adjusted tax rate in the range of 15% to 18%.\n\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share exclude the following items net of applicable tax: amortization of purchased intangibles, litigation and settlement-related expenses, acquisition and integration-related expenses, organizational restructuring expenses, and strategic transformation costs. A quantitative reconciliation of adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 is not available without unreasonable efforts because management cannot predict, with sufficient certainty, all of the elements necessary to provide such a reconciliation. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.\n\n**Conference Call & Webcast**\n\nThe Company will hold an investor conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time). The conference call dial-in number for North America listeners is (800) 225-9448, and international listeners may dial (203) 518-9708; the conference ID is FOXFQ324 or 36937324.

NASDAQ Global Select Market is a registered trademark of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to reporting financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States (“U.S.”), FOX is including in this press release certain non-GAAP financial measures consisting of “adjusted gross profit,” “adjusted gross margin,” “adjusted operating expense,” “adjusted operating expense as a percentage of net sales”, “adjusted net income,” “adjusted earnings per diluted share,” “adjusted EBITDA,” and “adjusted EBITDA margin,” all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. FOX defines adjusted gross profit as gross profit adjusted for the amortization of acquired inventory valuation markups. Adjusted gross margin is defined as adjusted gross profit divided by net sales. FOX defines adjusted operating expense as operating expense adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, litigation and settlement-related expenses, acquisition and integration-related expenses, organizational restructuring expenses, and certain strategic transformation costs. FOX defines adjusted operating margin as adjusted operating expense divided by net sales. FOX defines adjusted net income as net income adjusted for amortization of purchased intangibles, litigation and settlement-related expenses, acquisition and integration-related expenses, organizational restructuring expenses, and strategic transformation costs, all net of applicable tax. Adjusted earnings per diluted share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding during the period. FOX defines adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, net other expense, income taxes or tax benefits, amortization of purchased intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation, litigation and settlement related expenses, organizational restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration-related expenses and strategic transformation costs that are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. These adjustments are more fully described in the tables included at the end of this press release.\n\nFOX includes these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes they allow investors to better understand and evaluate the Company’s core operating performance and trends. In particular, the exclusion of certain items in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures consisting of adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expense, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA (and accordingly, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expense as a percentage of net sales, adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA margin) can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, including the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies because other companies may calculate adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin differently than FOX does. For more information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, see the tables included at the end of this press release.\n\n**FOX FACTORY HOLDING CORP.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets****(in thousands, except per share data)****(unaudited)**  \n---  \n**As of**| **As of**  \n**September 27, 2024**| **December 29, 2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 89,241| $| 83,642  \nAccounts receivable (net of allowances of $1,901 and $1,158, respectively)| 192,539| 171,060  \nInventory| 401,363| 371,841  \nPrepaids and other current assets| 128,026| 141,512  \nTotal current assets| 811,169| 768,055  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net| 243,215| 237,192  \nLease right-of-use assets| 108,054| 84,317  \nDeferred tax assets| 21,554| 21,297  \nGoodwill| 635,991| 636,565  \nTrademarks and brands, net| 265,876| 273,293  \nCustomer and distributor relationships, net| 165,775| 184,269  \nCore technologies, net| 23,904| 25,785  \nOther assets| 12,721| 11,525  \nTotal assets| $| 2,288,259| $| 2,242,298  \n**Liabilities and stockholders’ equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 134,554| $| 104,150  \nAccrued expenses| 93,874| 103,400  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt| 24,286| 14,286  \nTotal current liabilities| 252,714| 221,836  \nRevolver| 210,000| 370,000  \nTerm Loans, less current portion| 534,144| 359,242  \nOther liabilities| 94,343| 69,459  \nTotal liabilities| 1,091,201| 1,020,537  \nStockholders’ equity  \nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value — 10,000 authorized and no shares issued or outstanding as of September 27, 2024 and December 29, 2023| —| —  \nCommon stock, $0.001 par value — 90,000 authorized;

(Nasdaq: FOXF) announced it is fielding its first team to compete in the Rebelle Rally, the longest competitive off-road navigation rally in the United States and the first women’s endurance off-road rally in America.\n\nKristen Matlock, professional driver and FOX-supported athlete, along with Ashleigh Ballas, one of Fox Factory’s test engineers, will debut in the 4x4 class, driving a Fox Factory-designed and developed King of the Hammers Edition Ford Bronco.\n\nThe team's [2023 King of the Hammers edition Ford Bronco](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CBTUiDOkVHY_4yG-nQL5vna6ejv4aio5ausYpxyTc7hqhcaWbcu6cKUjvGHApFnRO0IsA6b_G_u_kgUniUCXo3WCeYX7u4DlN30FCbpN8WvNizaO5lOW-HQ2GnnZzypJS-QsjGMvSoou_CFHXGg8Dz7S9F5LTZBLBrHU1MQOJ3hDT7RDB7y5ODfrSjAftNe8XWB17n8BGgC2bVo_jidSUSXhgrkHvRNzgtyjUJaH0N5G3FzDuLI_sLb5ThZ8cMA81VAtkuD9FyWcnqr4y3L5wg==) boasts a custom suspension package, specifically designed by Fox Factory in collaboration with off-road enthusiasts to optimize comfort, articulation, and capability. This state-of-the-art vehicle serves as a testament to both Ford's engineering prowess and Fox Factory’s commitment to providing championship-level performance equipment.\n\nAdditionally, Fox is returning for a second consecutive year as a Rebelle Rally official partner through Trail Trust, Fox Factory’s social impact initiative. Since launching Trail Trust in 2021, Fox Factory has focused on championing sustainable adventure for all, including expanding access to outdoor adventuring so everyone can experience the thrill of the ride.\n\n“The Rebelle Rally perfectly embodies the mission of Trail Trust, and we’re thrilled to return as a partner,” shares Jackie Martin, Chief Purpose and Inclusion Officer. “I am even more excited to watch our first team take part in this grueling, skills-based competition. Eight days off the grid is no easy feat for anyone so I can’t wait to watch Ashleigh & Kristen shine on this impressive stage!”\n\nThis year's rally, taking place October 10 to 19, 2024, will see participants traverse over 1,500 miles of unforgiving terrain across the deserts of California and Nevada. Relying solely on map and compass, without GPS or internet assistance, teams will demonstrate exceptional teamwork, resilience, and navigational expertise.\n\nVisit [TrailTrust.com](http://TrailTrust.com) to learn more about the Trail Trust program and follow the Fox Factory team's journey at the 2024 Rebelle Rally.\n\nAbout Fox Factory Holding Corp.

          "content": "Safe Harbor This presentation does not constitute an offer or invitation for the sale or purchase of securities and has been\nprepared solely for informational purposes. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the\nStatement meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-\nlooking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some\ncases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “might,” “will,”\n“would,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,”\n“estimate,” “predict,” “likely,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or\nexpressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions.\nThese forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while\nconsidered reasonable by Fox Factory Holding Corp. (the “Company”) and its management, are inherently\nuncertain. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are\nnot limited to, future economic or market conditions and the other risks and uncertainties described in “Risk\nFactors” contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or\notherwise described in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. New risks\nand uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Company to predict all risks and\nuncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation.\nNothing in this presentation should be regarded as a representation by any person that the forward-looking\nstatements set forth herein will be achieved or that any of the contemplated results of such forward-looking\nstatements will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak\nonly as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no duty to update these forward-looking\nstatements.\nThis presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures determined by methods other than in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We use non-GAAP financial measures,\nincluding “Adjusted EBITDA,” as useful measures of the Company’s core operating performance and trends\nand period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s core business. These non-GAAP financial measures have\nlimitations as analytical tools and should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in\naccordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be\npresented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measures are included in the appendix to this presentation.\n2\nFox Factory Introduction\nWhy We Exist Who We Are What We Do\nOur purpose is to Our people play to Fox Factory delivers\nchallenge the win in all they do performance-\nimpossible and lead Their passion and defining products\ninthe never-ending diverse experiences that dominate their\npursuit of maximum make us the best of respective markets\nperformance the best through innovative\nsolutions and\ntechnologies\n3\nHow We Win\nInnovation leader\nUndisputed leader in ideation and\ntechnological advancement, creating a\nmulti-year pipeline of performance defining\nproducts\nPremium component manufacturer\nBest in class manufacturer backed by a\ndisciplined continuous improvement\nmindset\nAspirational brands unparalleled in space\nSought after by professional athletes,\ndesired by performance enthusiasts and\nmass markets\nUnique growth and diversification\nstrategy\n1+1=3 growth mindset unlocks top and\nbottom line expansion opportunities\n4\n1+1=3 Mindset Leads To Transformational Growth\nConsumer IPO since 2013 (% Return since IPO)\nSource: FactSet as of 1-30-2024,\nPublicly available information 1600% Fox Factory has\n1369% outperformed the\n1400%\nmajority\n1200%\nof consumer\n1000% IPOs since 2013\n800%\n600% 489%\n400% 330% 302% 283%\n156% 152%\n200% 117% 103% 84%\n46% 20% 15% 3% 3%\n0%\nWING FRPT FOXF BRBR GOLF TPB YETI CAVA BUFF SOVO ARMK ODD ONON BIRK SVV\n2013 2014 2015 2017 2019 2020 2021 2023\nProven Performance Through\n• Expansion into adjacencies • New products • Synergistic with brands\n• Geographic expansion • Highly accretive M&A • Strong ROI on Capex investments\n5\nDominant Aspirational Brands Drive Growth\nProfessional\nBrand Halo Drives\nAthletes Loyalty Across The\nDemand the best product PROS Consumer Landscape\nfor a competitive edge\nCore Consumer\nUltra & Performance\nEnthusiasts\nELITE\nDesire for the same\nperformance as the professional\nathletes they admire\nAffluent Consumers\nEVERYDAY ENTHUSIASTS Transformational Growth\nFulfill their dream of living the\nOpportunity\naffluent adventurer lifestyle, where\nonly the best of the best matters\n6\nStrong Secular Trends Underpin Our Strategy\nPersonalization Affluent Halo Effect Outdoor Living Spending on\nCustomer Sports\nSpending\nWe design product Higher wealth consumers Enthusiasts around the Consumers are enjoying Spending on sports is on\nofferings so consumers continue to spend more time outdoors and the rise as growing\nglobe want to identify\ncan customize their gear through challenging want the best performing investor base, societal\nwithand have what \"the\nmacro environments products changes, R&D converge\nbest\" in the industry are\nto grow the overall\nusing\nmarket\n7\nDiversification Is Our Strength - Three Growing Groups\n$433 $597 $846 $557 $279 $361 $432 $524 $245 $359 $489 $551\n2020 2021 2022 2023 2020 2021 2022 2023 2020 2021 2022 2023\nProForma Revenue: SSG + Marucci PVG Revenue: OEM Auto + PS + AM Channel AAG Revenue: Automotive AM\nFox will drive end consumer adoption and brand value by entering new markets in the aftermarket channel, ultimately leading to OEM\nspecification wins.
