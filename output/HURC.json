          "content": "HURCO COMPANIES, INC.\nCODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nScope\nThis Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code”) covers a wide range of business practices\nand procedures, and is designed to deter and detect any wrongdoing and promote the standards set\nforth herein. It does not cover every issue that may arise, but it sets out basic principles and\nstandards applicable to all employees, officers and directors of Hurco Companies, Inc. and all of\nits subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide (“Hurco” or the “Company”). All of our employees,\nofficers and directors must conduct themselves accordingly and seek to avoid even the appearance\nof improper behavior. The Code should also be provided to and followed by third parties acting\nfor the Company’s benefit or on the Company’s behalf, including agents, consultants and\ndistributors.\nIf a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law; however, if a local\ncustom or policy conflicts with this Code, you must comply with the Code. If you have any\nquestions about these conflicts, you should ask your supervisor how to handle the situation.\nThose who violate the standards in this Code will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up\nto and including termination of employment or service. If you are in a situation, which you\nbelieve may violate or lead to a violation of this Code, follow the guidelines described in Section\n16 of this Code.\nPractice\n1. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nObeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which this Company's ethical\nstandards are built. All employees, officers and directors must respect and obey the laws, rules\nand regulations of the cities, states and countries in which the Company conducts business. To\nthat effect, all employees, officers and directors must take an active role in being knowledgeable\nof and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and must immediately\nreport violations or suspected violations to the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of\nDirectors (in the case of directors or executive officers), to the Company's Chief Executive Officer\n(“CEO”) or Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) (in the case of other officers) or to the Director of\nthe Corporate Human Resources Department (the “HR Director”) (in the case of other employees).\nDuring any Company, government inspection or investigation, you should never destroy or alter\nany Company documents, lie or make misleading statements to the government investigator,\nattempt to cause another employee to fail to provide accurate information and/or obstruct, mislead\nor delay the communication of information or records.\n2. Related Person Transactions and Conflicts of Interest\nThe Company recognizes that “related person transactions” (as defined below) may raise questions\namong shareholders as to whether those transactions are consistent with the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders. A “related person transaction” is a transaction, arrangement or\nrelationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the\nCompany (including its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant, and in which any “related\nperson” had, has or will have a direct or indirect interest. A “related person” includes:\nany person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, an\n•\nemployee, director or officer of the Company, or a nominee to become a director of the\nCompany;\nany person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the\n•\nCompany's voting securities; and\nany immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which includes spouses,\n•\nchildren, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, stepparents, siblings, in-laws,\nspouse’s in-laws and any person (other than a tenant or employee) living in the same\nhousehold as the employee, director or officer (collectively, a “Family Member”).\nRelated person transactions are strictly prohibited under this Code, unless approved or ratified by\nthe Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, the CEO, CFO, or the Company\nPresident. Any employee, officer or director involved in a proposed related person transaction must\nprovide notice in writing to the Audit Committee (in the case of directors or executive officers),\nthe CEO or CFO (in the case of other officers) or to the employee's supervisor, who in turn must\nnotify the Company President (in the case of other employees) of the facts and circumstances of\nthe proposed related person transaction. The Audit Committee, CEO, CFO, or President with the\nassistance of outside counsel as necessary, will assess whether the proposed transaction is a related\nperson transaction and, if so, the proposed related person transaction will be submitted for\nconsideration. In determining whether to approve or ratify the related person transaction, the Audit\nCommittee, CEO, CFO, or President will consider, among other things, whether the transaction in\nquestion is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and, where applicable,\nthe terms of such transaction are at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained from\nan unrelated third party. The Audit Committee, CEO, CFO, or President will notify in writing, the\ndirector, officer or employee of its determination.\nIn addition to related person transactions, other conflicts of interest are strictly prohibited under\nthis Code, unless approved by the Audit Committee for any potential conflict involving directors\nor executive officers or the CEO, CFO or Company President for potential conflicts involving\nother officers or employees. A “conflict of interest” exists when a person's private interest\n-2-\ninterferes - or even appears to interfere - in any way with the interests of the Company. The\nexistence of a conflict depends upon the circumstances, including the nature and relative\nimportance of the interest involved. A conflict of interest situation can arise when an employee,\nofficer or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her\nCompany work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise when an employee,\nofficer or director, or members of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result\nof his or her position with the Company.\nAlthough it is not practical to list every activity or interest that might present a conflict of interest,\nthe following are examples of specific situations in which conflicts of interest could arise, and sets\nforth the Company's policy with respect to such conflicts of interest.\nInterests in Other Companies\nDirectors, officers or other employees, or any of their respective Family Members, shall\nnot acquire, own or have a significant financial interest1 in any business organization that\ndoes or seeks to do business with the Company or is a competitor of the Company, unless\n(a) such interest has been fully disclosed in writing to the Audit Committee of the\nCompany's Board of Directors (in the case of directors or executive officers), the CEO or\nCFO (in the case of other officers) or the employee's supervisor, who in turn must notify\nthe Company President (in the case of other employees) and (b) the Audit Committee,\nCEO, CFO, or President, as appropriate, notifies the director, officer or employee in writing\nthat it has been determined that the director's, officer's or employee's duties for the\nCompany will not require him or her to make or cause to be made decisions that could be\ninfluenced by such interest, or that the interest is otherwise permissible.\nEmployment by Other Companies\nDirectors, officers or employees shall not serve or accept an offer to serve as a director,\npartner, consultant of, or in a managerial position or any other form of employment or\naffiliation with, any business organization that does significant business with or is a\ncompetitor of the Company, unless (a) such position, employment or affiliation has been\nfully disclosed in writing to the Audit Committee (in the case of directors or executive\nofficers), to the CEO or CFO (in the case of other officers) or to the employee's supervisor,\nwho in turn must notify the Company President (in the case of other employees) and (b)\nthe Audit Committee, CEO, CFO or President, as appropriate, notifies the director, officer\nor employee in writing that it has been determined that such position, employment or\naffiliation is permissible.\n1 As a minimum standard, a significant financial interest is an aggregate interest of a director, officer or employee and\nfamily members in another company or business that represents 5% of more of the company or business or provides\n5% or more of the assets or income of such director, officer or employee. A significant financial interest generally\nwill not include an investment representing less than 1% of a class of outstanding securities of a publicly held\ncompany.\n-3-\nConducting Business with Related Companies\nDirectors, officers or employees shall not conduct business on behalf of the Company with\na member of his or her family, or a business organization with which he or she or a family\nmember has an interest or employment relationship that calls for disclosure under the Code\nstandards described above or that otherwise could be considered significant in terms of\npotential conflict of interest, unless (a) such business dealings have been disclosed in\nwriting to the Audit Committee (in the case of potential conflicts involving directors or\nexecutive officers) or to CEO or CFO (in the case of other officers) or the employee's\nsupervisor, who in turn must notify the Company President (in the case of other employees)\nand (b) the Audit Committee, CEO, CFO or President, as appropriate, notifies the director,\nofficer or employee that it has been determined that such transaction is permissible.\nUnrelated Outside Employment\nShould an officer or employee be engaged in outside employment not related to his or her\nregularly assigned work and not covered by the Code standards described above, such\noutside employment must not detract from the officer's or employee's job performance or\notherwise be detrimental to the best interests of the Company. Unless an officer or\nemployee has questions concerning the application of this policy to his or her particular\nsituation, no notice to the Company is required.\nReporting to an Immediate Family Member\nThe potential for conflict of interest clearly exists if your Family Member also works at the\nCompany and is in a direct reporting relationship with you. Employees should not directly\nsupervise, report to, or be in a position to influence the hiring, work assignments or\nevaluations of someone with whom they have a romantic or familial relationship.\nSoliciting Suppliers and Customers\nNo one should request donations from suppliers, customers or contractors to help pay for\nsocial functions, golf tournaments or other Company events. Solicitations of cash,\nmerchandise or services are not allowed because they could be perceived to create\nobligations in order to keep, increase or obtain Company business. The Company desires\nthat its suppliers and vendors understand that their business relationship with the Company\nis based totally on their ability to competitively meet the Company's business needs.\nFees and Honorariums\nWith prior approval, you may give lectures, conduct seminars, publish articles in books or\nengage in any other similar activity for which you may be paid a fee or honorarium.\nHowever, any fees, honorariums or reimbursements must be transferred to the Company\nunless written approval is given to retain them.\n-4-\n3. Anti-Corruption Policy\nScope and Policy Statement\nDoing business with integrity is a core value of Hurco. Each of us has a responsibility to\ndo our part to make sure our actions reflect that value in all of our business dealings. In\naddition, Hurco’s reputation is critical to our success. We take compliance with global\nanti-corruption laws very seriously.\nAccordingly, you may not ever, directly or through any third party, offer, promise,\nauthorize, give, solicit or receive bribes or kickbacks of any kind. Doing so would not only\nbe a violation of this Code, but also may be a violation of various anti-bribery laws,\nincluding the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). Special attention is given\nunder various anti-corruption laws to persons employed by or performing functions on\nbehalf of any non-U.S. government, including employees of a state-owned enterprise\n(“Government Employee”).\nBy way of summary, remember that all of the Company’s employees, officers, directors\nand third parties acting for our benefit or on our behalf are prohibited from ever (directly\nor indirectly) offering, making, promising or authorizing any payments, gifts or the\nprovision of anything else of value to any person (including any Government Employee)\nin order to obtain, retain or direct any business, or to secure any other business or regulatory\nbenefit for the Company in a manner that is corrupt or otherwise unlawful. Any violation\nof the FCPA may result in civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as jail time for the\nindividuals involved. The FCPA is enforced against public companies like Hurco by both\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (“DoJ”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”).\nCorruption issues can be complex. Warning signs may suggest improper conduct or corrupt\nintent, and employees should be familiar with these warning signs. Some warning signs,\nor “red flags”, are set forth in the Company’s FCPA Compliance Guidelines (the\n“Guidelines”). The Guidelines also provide important additional details regarding\ncompliance with this Code and the FCPA, including requirements regarding the pre-\nretention due diligence on proposed agents, consultants or distributors, doing business with\nGovernment Employees and other useful and important information. You are expected to\nread, understand and strictly comply with this Code and the Guidelines. If you are\nuncertain as to whether any conduct may violate this Code or the Guidelines, you must\nimmediately seek guidance from the Company’s General Counsel or Corporate HR\nDirector prior to engaging, or authorizing, any such conduct.\nIn addition to prohibiting bribery, public companies like Hurco are also required to make\nand maintain accurate books and records in reasonable detail that reflect the true nature of\nall transactions the Company enters into, and the disposition of all Company assets. Failure\nis a violation of the FCPA, enforced by the SEC.\nIt is the responsibility of each officer, director and employee of the Company to familiarize\nthemselves with this Code and the Guidelines, and to comply with them and all applicable\n-5-\nanti-corruption laws. Failure will result in appropriate disciplinary action, up to and\nincluding termination of employment.\nFacilitating Payments\nWhile in some countries it is common for a government employee to demand small\n“facilitating” or “grease” payments in order to perform routine, non-discretionary actions,\nthe prior approval of the General Counsel is required before any such payments may be\nmade, offered or authorized.\n4. Gifts, Favors, Entertainment and Payments\nOffered, Promised, Made, Provided or Authorized by Company Directors, Officers or\nEmployees.\nYou should be aware that it is a violation of law to confer benefits on an employee of\nanother company if it is made without such person's employer's consent or knowledge and\nwith intent to influence such person's conduct in relation to the affairs of the employer. The\ninfrequent giving of modestly valued, seasonal gifts at holiday time is generally not\nconsidered to be a violation of this policy; however, at no time may cash or cash equivalents\n(gift cards, savings bonds, stock, etc.) be issued as gifts. And, at no time may anything be\nsought or expected in return for a gift.\nGifts can include anything of value, including meals or entertainment, if the person\nproviding the meal or entertainment is not in attendance. Examples of things that can be\nconsidered gifts include bottles of wine, products, tickets to entertainment or sporting\nevents, lodging, discounts on products or services, services, equipment, prizes,\ntransportation or reimbursement of travel expenses, use of vehicles or vacation homes,\nhome improvements, tickets, and favorable terms on a product or service.\nYou may dispense common courtesies or ordinary social amenities generally associated\nwith accepted business practices for generalized goodwill purposes if they meet all the\nfollowing criteria:\n(a) There is nothing expected in return.\n(b) They are infrequent and limited in value, not to exceed U.S. $100 value per\ngift and in a form that will not be construed as a bribe or pay-off. In addition,\nyou should not offer or receive gifts during any 12-month period from the\nsame company or persons affiliated with that company exceeding a total of\nU.S. $250. If applicable local law sets stricter gift limits than the monetary\nlimits provided here, for example a RMB 200 or less limit applies to certain\ngifts in China, you must follow the local law.)\n(c) They are not in violation of this Code, the Guidelines, applicable law and\ngenerally accepted ethical standards of a U.S. public, multinational\ncompany.\n-6-\n(d) Public disclosure of the facts will not embarrass the Company or any\ndirector, officer or employee of the Company.\nSecret commissions or other secret compensation or payments are never\npermissible and may be a criminal offense.\n(See Section 14, Payments to Government Personnel, for a description of the\nCompany's policy on gifts and other payments to U.S. governmental employees.)\nReceived by Company Directors, Officers or Key Employees.\nYou may not seek or accept any gifts (as defined above), payments, fees, services,\nprivileges, vacations or pleasure trips (even with an apparent business purpose), loans\n(other than conventional loans on customary terms from lending institutions) or other\nfavors from any person or business organization that does or seeks to do business with, or\nis a competitor of, the Company. No one may accept anything of value in exchange for\nreferral of third parties to any such person or business organization. In applying this policy:\n(a) You may accept common courtesies or ordinary social amenities generally\nassociated with accepted business practices for yourself and members of\nyour families.\n(b) It is never permissible to accept cash or cash equivalents (savings bonds,\nstock, etc.) of any amount. In addition, entertainment beyond that\ndescribed by (a) above should not be accepted under any circumstances.\n(c) Same policies as (a) – (d) above.\nPolitical and Charitable Contributions\nDirectors, officers and employees shall not use Company funds for contributions of any\nkind to any political party or committee or to any candidate for, or holder of, any office of\nany government – national, state or local. This policy is not intended to restrict in any\nmanner the use of personal funds for political contributions. No such personal use of funds\nwill be reimbursed by the Company under any circumstances.\nCharitable contributions proposed to be made to or for the benefit of any recipients outside\nthe United States must be approved in advance by the General Counsel and the CFO.\nAgain, conflicts of interest are prohibited as a matter of Company policy, except where approved\nin accordance with this Code. Conflicts of interest are not always clear-cut, so if you have a\nquestion, you should consult with the CEO or CFO. Any employee, officer or director who\n-7-\nbecomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict involving another person who is a director or\nemployee of the Company should bring it to the attention of the CEO or CFO of the Company or\nconsult the procedures described in Section 16, Reporting any Illegal or Unethical Behavior, of\nthis Code.\n5. Insider Trading\nEmployees, officers or directors who have access to non-public material information are not\npermitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose\nexcept the conduct of our business. The term “trade” includes all securities transactions in the\nopen market, and includes transactions in Company plans (if any) that include Hurco stock. All\nnon-public information about the Company should be considered confidential information. To use\nnon-public information for personal financial benefit or to “tip” others who might make an\ninvestment decision on the basis of this information is not only unethical but also is a violation of\nfederal securities laws and can result in civil and criminal penalties. Non-public, material\ninformation includes, but is not limited to: significant new product/service developments, sales\nand earnings reports or projections, major contracts with customers or suppliers, plans for stock\nsplits or buy backs and potential acquisitions or mergers. Such non-public material information in\nthe case of another company would also include knowledge that the other company may enter into\nor is negotiating for a contract important to it for the sale of property, goods or services to or by\nthe Company. In these instances where you have such information, you must refrain from buying\nor selling or encouraging others to buy or sell the Company's securities or securities of another\ncompany, as the case may be, until the information has been disclosed to the general public. If you\nhave any questions about the appropriateness of purchasing or selling a security under these\ncircumstances you should contact the CEO or CFO.\nDirectors and officers of the Company are reminded that they are subject to additional obligations\nand to certain reporting requirements under federal securities laws, which are beyond the scope of,\nand are not discussed in, this Code.\n6. Corporate Opportunities\nEmployees, officers and directors are prohibited from taking for themselves personally\nopportunities that are discovered through the use of Company property, information or position\nwithout the consent of the Board of Directors. No employee, officer or director may use Company\nproperty, information, or position for improper personal gain, and no employee, officer or director\nmay compete with the Company directly or indirectly. (See Section 2, Related Person Transactions\nand Conflicts of Interest.) Employees, officers and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance\nits legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.\n7. Competition and Fair Dealing\nWe seek to outperform our competition fairly and honestly. We seek competitive advantages\nthrough superior performance, never through unethical or illegal business practices. Stealing\nproprietary information, possessing trade secret information that was obtained without the owner's\nconsent, or inducing such disclosures by past or present employees of other companies is\nprohibited. You should endeavor to respect the rights of and deal fairly with the Company's\ncustomers, suppliers, competitors and employees. You should not take unfair advantage of\n-8-\nanyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation\nof material facts, or any other intentional unfair-dealing practice.\n8. Full, Fair, Accurate, Timely and Understandable Disclosure\nIt is the Company's policy to provide full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosures\nin all reports and documents that the Company files with or submits to the SEC, as well as in all\nother public communications made by the Company. In furtherance of this policy, the executive\nofficers of the Company shall design, implement, and amend as necessary, disclosure controls\nand procedures and internal controls for financial reporting (collectively “Controls and\nProcedures”). All executive officers, directors and employees shall comply with the Controls and\nProcedures to promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosures by the\nCompany.\n9. Discrimination and Harassment\nThe diversity of the Company's work force and management is a tremendous asset. We are firmly\ncommitted to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and will not tolerate any\nillegal discrimination or harassment of any kind. Examples include derogatory comments based\non racial or ethnic characteristics and unwelcome sexual advances.\n10. Health and Safety\nThe Company strives to provide a safe and healthful work environment. Everyone has a\nresponsibility for maintaining a safe and healthy workplace by following safety and health rules\nand practices and reporting accidents, injuries and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.\nViolence and threatening behavior are not permitted. Employees should report to work in\ncondition to perform their duties, free from the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol. The use of\nillegal drugs in the workplace will not be tolerated.\n11. Record-Keeping\nThe Company requires that all personnel support and enable the Company to fulfill its obligations\nfor accurate, timely and complete record keeping that correctly reflects the nature of the\ntransactions in which the Company is engaged, and the disposition of all Company assets. This\nrequirement relates to gifts, travel and entertainment and all other business practices. Many\nofficers and employees regularly use business expense accounts. All expenses incurred in relation\nto Company business must be incurred in accordance with the Company’s Gift, Travel and\nEntertainment (“GT&E”) policy and in accordance with the division’s GT&E policy. All expenses\nmust be documented and recorded accurately. If you are not sure whether a certain expense is\nlegitimate, ask the CFO, your supervisor or the Accounting Department.\nAll of the Company's books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in\nreasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Company's transactions and must conform both to\napplicable legal requirements and to the Company's system of internal controls. Unrecorded or\n“off the books” funds or assets are strictly prohibited.\n-9-\nBusiness records and communications often become public, and you should avoid exaggeration,\nderogatory remarks, guesswork, or inappropriate characterizations of people and companies that\ncould be misunderstood. This applies equally to e-mail, internal memos, and formal reports.\nRecords should always be retained or destroyed according to the Company's record retention\npolicies. In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation,\nplease notify the CEO or CFO.\n12. Confidentiality\nEmployees, officers and directors must maintain the confidentiality of confidential information\nentrusted to them by the Company or its customers, except when disclosure is authorized by the\nCEO or CFO or required by applicable laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all\nnon-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its\ncustomers, if disclosed.\nEmployees, officers and directors who have access to confidential information are obligated to\nsafeguard it from unauthorized access and:\n• not disclose this information to persons outside the Company. (Exercise caution when\ndiscussing company business in public places where conversations can be overheard.\nRecognize the potential for eavesdropping on cellular phones.)\n• not use this information for personal benefit or the benefit of persons outside of the\nCompany.\n• not share this information with other employees except on a legitimate “need to know”\nbasis.\nWritten approval from management is required before confidential information can be released\noutside the Company. This includes speeches, technical papers for publication, Company\nreferences, endorsements of other products and services, and information the Company has\nreceived from other companies under an obligation of confidentiality.\nAny Company information created in the course of your employment or service belongs to the\nCompany. The obligation to preserve confidential information continues even after your\nemployment or service ends. Upon retirement or termination of employment or service, all written\nand tangible proprietary, confidential information must be returned to the Company prior to or on\nyour last day of employment or service.\n13. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nAll employees, officers and directors should endeavor to protect the Company's assets and ensure\ntheir efficient use. Theft, carelessness, and waste have a direct impact on the Company's\nprofitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported for\ninvestigation. Company assets should not be used for non-Company business, though incidental\npersonal use may be permitted.\n-10-\nUse of email, voice mail and Internet services\nE-mail systems and Internet services are provided to help you do our work. Incidental and\noccasional personal use is permitted, but never for personal gain or any improper purpose. Do not\naccess, send, or download any information that could be insulting or offensive to another person,\nsuch as sexually explicit messages, cartoons, jokes, ethnic or racial slurs, or any other message that\ncould be viewed as harassment. Also, remember that “flooding” Company computer systems with\njunk mail and trivia hampers the ability of the Company's systems to handle legitimate Company\nbusiness.\nYour messages (including voice mail) and computer information are considered Company\nproperty and you should not have any expectation of privacy. Unless prohibited by law, the\nCompany reserves the right to access and disclose this information as necessary for business\npurposes. Use good judgment, and do not access, send a message, or store any information that\nyou would not want to be seen or heard by other individuals. Violation of these policies may result\nin disciplinary actions up to and including discharge from the Company.\nProprietary Information\nYour obligation to protect the Company's assets includes its proprietary information. Proprietary\ninformation includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and\ncopyrights, as well as business, marketing and service plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas,\ndesigns, databases, records, salary information and any unpublished financial data and reports.\nUnauthorized use or distribution of this information may destroy the information's value, harm the\nCompany's competitive position, or constitute breaches of agreements. It could also be illegal and\nresult in civil or even criminal penalties.\nThe Company's guidelines regarding treatment of proprietary information are:\n• Proprietary information should be discussed with Company employees only on a “need-\nto-know” basis.\n• Unless someone with proper authority decides publicly to disclose proprietary information,\ndisclosures to anyone outside the Company should occur only in conjunction with an\nexecuted confidential disclosure agreement.\n• Always remain alert to inadvertent disclosure of proprietary information, e.g., in social\nconversations or normal business relations with suppliers, customers and others.\n• Do not accept proprietary information from third parties unless such information is subject\nto a written confidentiality agreement.\nWhile you must remain alert to the competitive environment and seek information with respect to\nthe Company's markets and its competitors, you must do so only by means that are lawful and\nethical. You must never participate in illegal or improper acquisition of another's proprietary\ninformation. If you are approached with offers of such information, or with any information\nbelieved to have originated illegally or improperly, you must immediately refer the matter to the\nCEO or CFO (See Section 12, Confidentiality.)\n-11-\n14. Payments to Government Personnel\nIn addition to the prohibitions imposed by the FCPA, as discussed in Section 3, Anti-Corruption\nPolicy, above, the U.S. government has a number of laws and regulations regarding business\ngratuities, which may be accepted by U.S. government personnel. The promise, offer or delivery\nto an official or employee of the U.S. government of a gift, favor or other gratuity in violation of\nthese rules would not only violate Company policy but could also be a criminal offense.\n15. Waivers of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics3\nOnly the Board may make any waiver of this Code for executive officers or directors and any such\nwaiver will be promptly disclosed to the Company shareholders, as may be required by law or\nstock exchange regulation. Waivers of this Code for any other officers or employees may only be\nmade by the CEO.\n3 Under the SEC's rules, the C ompany is required to promptly disclose substantive amendments to or waivers from\na provision of this Code that applies to specified company officers. The Company may choose to provide such\ndisclosure either by filing a Form 8-K with the SEC or by disclosing such information on its website. However, the\nCompany may disclose such information on its website only if it has disclosed in its most recently filed annual report\non Form 10-K that it intends to disclose these events on its website, and its Internet website address.\n16. Reporting any Illegal or Unethical Behavior\nAll employees, officers and directors should report violations of laws, regulations, rules or this\nCode. If you are concerned that someone has violated or may violate any law or Code standard,\nyou may report these concerns to the Company’s General Counsel, the HR Director or other\nappropriate management representatives.\nIf you have any concerns regarding questionable accounting, auditing or disclosure practices of\nthe Company, you may report these concerns to the CFO, the General Counsel or directly to the\nCompany's Audit Committee. You may submit those concerns in a confidential and anonymous\nmanner by mailing them to the following address:\nAudit Committee Chairman\nHurco Companies, Inc.\nOne Technology Way\nIndianapolis, IN 46268\nYou may also submit complaints regarding questionable accounting, auditing or disclosure\npractices of the Company by contacting the Anonymous Hotline (Syntrio) at 833-782-8795 or by\nvisiting www.lighthouse-services.com/hurco and clicking on “Report an Incident”.

When possible, we will provide you with the status of our\ninvestigation and inform you of the outcome.\nRetaliation by any officer, employee, director or agent of the Company against any individual who\nseeks advice, raises a concern or reports misconduct is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.\nThe Company will take appropriate action against any individuals engaging in retaliatory conduct\nagainst an employee who has truthfully, and in good faith, reported a violation. Retaliatory actions\ninclude suspension or termination of employment, demotion, threats, harassment or any other form\nof discrimination. Appropriate action will also be taken against any individual who has\nintentionally made a false report. This “anti-retaliation” policy is not intended to protect a person\nwho is involved in wrongdoing about which he or she is making a report.\nIf you suspect that you, or someone you know, has been retaliated against for making a report, you\nshould contact the General Counsel or HR Director immediately. You may also contact Syntrio at\nthe phone numbers or website noted above or write to the Company's Audit Committee at the\naddress set forth above. Your complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of\nindividuals involved, the names of any witnesses, and any documentary evidence.\n-13-\nAll complaints of prohibited retaliation that are reported as described above will be investigated.\nThe Company will promptly undertake and direct an effective, thorough and objective\ninvestigation of the retaliation allegations. The investigation will be completed and a\ndetermination regarding the alleged retaliation will be made and communicated to the employee\nwho complains and to the person(s) accused of retaliation.\nIf the Company determines that an individual has suffered adverse action in retaliation for seeking\nadvice, raising a concern or reporting misconduct or participation in a proceeding related to\npotential misconduct, it will take effective remedial action appropriate to the circumstances. The\nCompany will also take action to deter any future retaliation. If a complaint of unlawful retaliation\nis substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, will be taken.\nWhatever action is taken against the person responsible for the retaliation will be communicated\nto the employee who complained.\n17. Compliance Standards and Procedures\nInterpretation\nThe Company's CEO is responsible for giving guidance on interpreting and applying the Code\nwhen questions arise. Any questions should be addressed in writing to the CEO at the Company's\ncorporate headquarters.\nAudits\nPeriodically, the Company will monitor compliance with the Code. Everyone must cooperate fully\nwith these reviews and provide truthful and accurate information. Results of all such reviews will\nbe reported to appropriate Company management or the Audit Committee.\nRequest for Exception\nWhile some standards in the Code require strict application, others do allow exceptions. For\nexample, minor conflicts of interest may be resolved by disclosing the conflict to all interested\nparties. Executive officers and directors who believe they merit an exception should first contact\nthe CEO or a member of the Audit Committee, and other officers or employees should first contact\nthe CFO or HR Director.\nNon-Exclusivity\nWhile the Code standards are extensive, they are no means exhaustive. Nothing expressed or\nimplied in the Code can represent all the policies and procedures the Company believes its\nemployees, officers and directors should follow.\nRemember, if you suspect that a violation of the law or the Code has taken place or may take place,\nkeep the following guidelines in mind:\n-14-\n• Make sure you have all the facts. In order to reach the right solutions, we must be as fully\ninformed as possible.\n• Ask yourself: What specifically am I being asked to do? Does it seem unethical or\nimproper? This will enable you to focus on the specific question you are faced with, and\nthe alternatives you have. Use your judgment and common sense; if something seems\nunethical or improper, it probably is.\n• Clarify your responsibility role. In most situations, there is shared responsibility. Are your\ncolleagues informed? It may help to get others involved and discuss the problem.\n• Discuss the problem with your supervisor, division general manager, the HR Director or\nan Audit Committee Member. This is the basic guidance for all situations. In many cases\nthese individuals will be more knowledgeable about the question, and will appreciate being\nbrought into the decision-making process. Remember that it is their responsibility to help\nsolve problems.\n• Seek help from Company resources. In the rare case where it may not be appropriate to\ndiscuss an issue with the CEO, CFO or an Audit Committee member, or where you do not\nfeel comfortable approaching the CEO, CFO or an Audit Committee member with your\nquestion, discuss it with the Company’s General Counsel or HR Director. If you prefer to\nwrite, address your concerns to: the Company's General Counsel at the company's\nheadquarters or to the Audit Committee at the address shown in Section 16, Reporting any\nIllegal or Unethical Behavior.\n• You may report ethical violations in confidence and without fear of retaliation. If your\nsituation requires that your identity be kept secret, your anonymity will be protected. The\nCompany does not permit retaliation of any kind against employees for good faith reports\nof ethical violations.\nAlways ask first, act later: If you are unsure of what to do in any situation seek guidance\nbefore you act.\n-15-"

          "content": "HURCO COMPANIES, INC.\nRESPONSIBLE SOURCING & TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAIN STATEMENT\nThe State of California has passed the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the\n“Act”). The Act requires that certain large retailers and manufacturers doing business in California\nto disclose on their websites their “efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from [their]\ndirect supply chain for tangible goods offered for sale.” The Act does not mandate that businesses\nimplement new measures to ensure that their product supply chains are free from human trafficking\nand slavery. Instead, it requires that covered businesses make certain required disclosures, namely\nwhether the company engages in any of the following statutorily enumerated activities in attempt\nto eliminate human trafficking or slavery from its supply chain: (1) verification; (2) audit; (3)\ncertification; (4) internal accountability; or (5) training. This Responsible Sourcing &\nTransparency in Supply Chain Statement (this “Statement”) memorializes Hurco Companies,\nInc.’s (“Hurco” or the “Company”) disclosure requirements under the Act. The Statement applies\nto Hurco and all subsidiaries of the Company that are subject to the Act.\nHurco is committed to the responsible sourcing of products, services, and components in\nits supply chain and transparency related thereto. The Company has demonstrated this commitment\nin a number of ways, including:\n(1) adoption and implementation of a Conflict Minerals Policy Statement, pursuant to which\nHurco publicly expresses its commitment to (a) work with its suppliers to responsibly\nsource materials and components it uses in manufacturing that may contain certain covered\n“conflict minerals” and (b) periodically requests chain of custody declarations from its\nsuppliers in attempt to verify the origin of any potential conflict minerals contained in their\nproducts;\n(2) adoption and implementation of a Supplier Code of Conduct, pursuant to which the\nCompany communicates its expectation that its suppliers and vendors will comply with all\nlaws and legal requirements applicable to the operation of their respective businesses,\nadhere to respecting certain fundamental human rights (including refraining from forced\nlabor, slavery, and human trafficking), not engage in unethical business practices, and\nstrive for continuous improvement with respect to their environmental stewardship,\nincluding investigating options for the reduction of the waste and pollution they create;\n(3) adoption and implementation of a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, pursuant to which\nall Company employees are required to comply with all laws, rules, and regulations\napplicable to the operation and conduct of Hurco’s business; and\n(4) implementation and maintenance of an anonymous ethics and whistleblower hotline,\npursuant to which employees, suppliers, vendors, and other stakeholders may\nconfidentially report suspected or known violations of laws or Company policies or other\nunethical conduct or behavior.\nBased on the foregoing, and otherwise upon information and belief, Hurco is not aware that any\nof its suppliers engage in human trafficking or slavery, nor has it received any information or\nallegations suggesting that its suppliers do.\nAlthough the Company is committed to responsible sourcing and unaware of any human\ntrafficking or slavery within its supply chain as otherwise set forth above, the Act requires Huco\nto disclose that the Company does not engage in the subject disclosure activities expressly set forth\nin the Act. More specifically, except as otherwise specifically set forth above, Hurco does not (1)\nverify its supply chains to evaluate and address specific risks of human trafficking and slavery; (2)\nconduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with its standards for trafficking and\nslavery in supply chains; (3) require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into our\nproducts comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking; (4) maintain internal\naccountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company\nstandards regarding slavery and trafficking; or (5) provide company employees and management,\nwho have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and\nslavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products."
