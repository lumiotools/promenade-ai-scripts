GAAP net loss in the second quarter of 2024 was $24.8 million or $(0.09) per share, compared to GAAP net loss of $14.6 million or $(0.05) per share in the prior year. Adjusted Net Income1 was $(5.9) million or $(0.02) per share, compared to $16.3 million or $0.06 per share in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA1 was $83.5 million compared to $112.6 million in the prior year.\n\n\"Our second quarter results demonstrate the ongoing work of our teams to strengthen our retail fundamentals and accelerate the path to improved profitability,\" said **Joel Anderson , Petco's Chief Executive Officer**. \"I could not be more excited to lead Petco at this pivotal time. Looking ahead, I see tremendous opportunities for us to significantly improve our operating and financial performance and better leverage Petco's strengths to capture greater share, deliver sustained profitability, and create value for shareholders.\"\n\n(1) |  Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\"), and Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Fiscal Q3 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe company is providing Q3 guidance for revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS, in addition to reaffirming full year interest expense and capital expenditure expectations.\n\nFor Fiscal Q3 2024, the company expects: \n\nMetric* |  FQ3 2024 Guidance  \n---|---  \nNet Revenue |  ~ $1.5 billion  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $76 million to $80 million  \nAdjusted EPS |  $(0.03) to $(0.04)  \n  \nFor Fiscal 2024 (a 52-week year), the company expects the following, both of which are unchanged:\n\nMetric* |  2024 Guidance, YoY  \n---|---  \nNet interest expense |  ~$145 million  \nCapital Expenditures |  ~$140 million  \n  \n*Assumptions in the guidance include that economic conditions, currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape remain generally consistent. For fiscal 2024, our guidance anticipates a 26 percent tax rate, and 272 million weighted average diluted share count. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and have not been reconciled to the most comparable GAAP outlook because it is not possible to do so without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and potential variability of reconciling items, which are dependent on future events and often outside of management's control and which could be significant. Because such items cannot be reasonably predicted with the level of precision required, we are unable to provide outlook for the comparable GAAP measures. Forward-looking estimates of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are made in a manner consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions noted herein and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call Webcast Information:**\n\nManagement will host an earnings conference call on September 10, 2024 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time to discuss the company's financial results.

The company has provided this non-GAAP financial information, which is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in this earnings release that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release. The non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThe tables below reflect the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS, as applicable, for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to the thirteen weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, including Trailing Twelve Month Adjusted EBITDA, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules because it excludes certain amounts included in net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure to share with investors because it facilitates comparison of the current period performance with that of the comparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA affords investors a view of what management considers to be Petco's core operating performance as well as the ability to make a more informed assessment of such operating performance as compared with that of the prior period.

Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are meaningful measures to share with investors because they facilitate comparison of the current period performance with that of the comparable prior period. In addition, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS afford investors a view of what management considers to be Petco's core earnings performance as well as the ability to make a more informed assessment of such earnings performance with that of the prior period. \n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)** |  **13 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Adjusted EPS** |  **August 3, 2024** |  **July 29, 2023**  \n**Amount** |  **Per share** |  **Amount** |  **Per share**  \n**Net loss attributable to common stockholders / diluted EPS** |  **$ (24,823)** |  **$ (0.09)** |  **$ (14,606)** |  **$ (0.05)**  \nAdd (deduct):  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense |  (4,651) |  (0.01) |  6,732 |  0.02  \nLoss on partial extinguishment of debt |  — |  — |  305 |  0.00  \nGoodwill impairment |  — |  — |  — |  —  \nAsset impairments and write offs |  3,561 |  0.01 |  1,031 |  0.01  \nEquity-based compensation |  11,914 |  0.04 |  24,119 |  0.09  \nOther non-operating income |  — |  — |  (1,795) |  (0.01)  \nOther costs (3) |  5,960 |  0.02 |  6,183 |  0.02  \nAdjusted pre-tax (loss) income / diluted (loss) earnings per share |  $ (8,039) |  $ (0.03) |  $ 21,969 |  $ 0.08  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense at 26% normalized tax rate |  (2,090) |  (0.01) |  5,712 |  0.02  \n**Adjusted Net (Loss) Income / Adjusted EPS** |  **$ (5,949)** |  **$ (0.02)** |  **$ 16,257** |  **$ 0.06**  \n  \n**Free Cash Flow**\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for fixed assets. Management believes that Free Cash Flow, which measures the ability to generate additional cash from business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company's financial performance.\n\nThe table below reflects the calculation of Free Cash Flow for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, respectively.\n\n**(in thousands)** |  **13 Weeks Ended** |  **26 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---|---  \n**August 3 ,****2024** |  **July 29 ,****2023** |  **August 3 ,****2024** |  **July 29 ,****2023**  \nNet cash provided by operating activities |  $ 69,370 |  $ 96,614 |  $ 60,956 |  $ 134,265  \nCash paid for fixed assets |  (27,388) |  (51,973) |  (60,029) |  (114,023)  \n**Free Cash Flow** |  **$ 41,982** |  **$ 44,641** |  **$ 927** |  **$ 20,242**  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures Footnotes**\n\n(1) |  Mexico Joint Venture EBITDA represents 50 percent of the entity's operating results for all periods, as adjusted to reflect the results on a basis comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In the financial statements, this joint venture is accounted for as an equity method investment and reported net of depreciation and income taxes because such a presentation would not reflect the adjustments made in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, we include the 50 percent interest in the company's Mexico joint venture on an Adjusted EBITDA basis to ensure consistency. The table below presents a reconciliation of Mexico joint venture net income to Mexico joint venture EBITDA.  \n---|---  \n  \n**13 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**(in thousands)** |  **August 3 ,****2024** |  **July 29 ,****2023**  \nNet income |  $ 8,822 |  $ 6,656  \nDepreciation |  6,996 |  6,443  \nIncome tax expense |  3,903 |  2,364  \nForeign currency (gain) loss |  (380) |  395  \nInterest expense, net |  463 |  1,230  \nEBITDA |  $ 19,804 |  $ 17,088  \n**50% of EBITDA** |  **$ 9,902** |  **$ 8,544**  \n  \n(2) |  Acquisition and divestiture-related costs include direct costs resulting from acquiring, integrating, or divesting businesses.
