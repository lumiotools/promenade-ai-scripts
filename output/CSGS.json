From a shareholder return perspective, we plan on returning $100+\nmillion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in each of 2024 and 2025. Returning capital to\nshareholders remains a cornerstone commitment as we have returned nearly $500 million to shareholders since\n2020.”\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 2\nFinancial Overview (unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nPercent Percent\n2024 2023 Changed 2024 2023 C hanged\nGAAP Results:\nRevenue ....................................... $ 295,143 $ 286,868 2.9 % $ 880,596 $ 871,934 1.0 %\nOperating Income ......................... 31,822 32,731 (2.8 %) 89,039 99,130 (10.2 %)\nOperating Margin Percentage ...... 10.8 % 11.4 % 10.1 % 11.4 %\nEPS............................................... $ 0.67 $ 0.62 8.1 % $ 1.83 $ 1.75 4.6 %\nNon-GAAP Results:\nOperating Income ......................... $ 50,076 $ 45,203 10.8 % $ 141,085 $ 141,664 (0.4 %)\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nPercentage ............................... 18.4 % 17.0 % 17.4 % 17.5 %\nEPS............................................... $ 1.06 $ 0.92 15.2 % $ 3.08 $ 2.76 11.6 %\nFor additional information and reconciliations regarding CSG’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, please refer\nto the attached Exhibit 2 and the Investor Relations section of CSG’s website at csgi.com.\nResults of Operations\nGAAP Results: Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $295.1 million, a 2.9% increase when compared to\nrevenue of $286.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue can be attributed to the continued\ngrowth of our SaaS and related solutions revenue, to include approximately $6 million of revenue generated from\nthe businesses acquired in the second quarter of 2024, which more than offset lower software and services\nrevenue for the quarter.\nGAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.8 million, or 10.8% of total revenue, compared to\n$32.7 million, or 11.4% of total revenue, for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in operating income is mainly\nattributed to the increase in acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, to include earn-out\ncompensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nGAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.67, compared to $0.62 for the third quarter of 2023, with the third\nquarter of 2024 benefiting from a lower effective income tax rate and a lower share count, partially offset by foreign\ncurrency movements.\nNon-GAAP Results: Non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $50.1 million, or a non-GAAP\nadjusted operating margin of 18.4%, compared to $45.2 million, or a non-GAAP adjusted operating margin of\n17.0% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP adjusted\noperating margin can be primarily attributed to the higher revenue discussed above.\nNon-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.06 compared to $0.92 for the third quarter of 2023. The\nincrease in non-GAAP EPS is mainly due to the higher non-GAAP operating income, discussed above, and the\nlower share count, partially offset by foreign currency movements.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 3\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 were $118.4 million compared to $110.4 million as of\nJune 30, 2024 and $186.3 million as of December 31, 2023. CSG had net cash flows provided by operations for\nthe third quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of $39.5 million and $24.6 million, respectively, and non-\nGAAP free cash flow of $32.0 million and $18.1 million, respectively.\nSummary of Financial Guidance\nCSG is revising its financial guidance for the full year 2024, as follows:\nAs of November 6,\n2024 Previous\nGAAP Measures:\nRevenue ..............................................................................

CSG believes that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial measures, provide\ninvestors with greater transparency to the information used by CSG’s management in its financial and operational\ndecision making. CSG uses these non-GAAP financial measures for the following purposes:\n• Certain internal financial planning, reporting, and analysis;\n• Forecasting and budgeting;\n• Certain management compensation incentives; and\n• Communications with CSG’s Board of Directors, stockholders, financial analysts, and investors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided with the intent of providing investors with the following\ninformation:\n• A more complete understanding of CSG’s underlying operational results, trends, and cash generating\ncapabilities;\n• Consistency and comparability with CSG’s historical financial results; and\n• Comparability to similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to\ninvestors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP, and therefore should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Limitations with the use of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures include the following items:\n• Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or\nprinciples;\n• The way in which CSG calculates non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the way in which other\ncompanies calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures;\n• Non-GAAP financial measures do not include all items of income and expense that affect CSG’s\noperations and that are required by GAAP to be included in financial statements;\n• Certain adjustments to CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures result in the exclusion of items that are\nrecurring and will be reflected in CSG’s financial statements in future periods; and\n• Certain charges excluded from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures are cash expenses, and therefore\ndo impact CSG’s cash position.\nCSG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as a supplement only. Additionally, CSG provides specific information regarding the treatment of GAAP\namounts considered in preparing the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles each non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 10\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: Basis of Presentation\nThe table below outlines the exclusions from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures:\nAdjusted Operating\nNon-GAAP Exclusions Operating Income Margin Percentage EPS\nTransaction fees..................................................... — X —\nRestructuring and reorganization charges ............. X X X\nExecutive transition costs ...................................... X X X\nAcquisition-related expenses:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets .......

X X X\nStock-based compensation .................................... X X X\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment/conversion ..... — — X\nGain (loss) on acquisitions or dispositions ............. — — X\nUnusual income tax matters .................................. — — X\nCSG believes that excluding certain items in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding CSG’s performance and these items are excluded for the following reasons:\n• Transaction fees are primarily comprised of fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial\ninstitutions and interchange fees under CSG’s payment services contracts. Transaction fees are included in\nrevenue in CSG’s Income Statement (and not netted against revenue) because CSG maintains control and\nacts as principal over the integrated service provided under its payment services customer contracts.\nHowever, CSG excludes expense associated with transaction fees from the numerator and denominator in\ncalculating its non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage in order to provide comparability with\nhistorical and future periods and with its peer group and competitors.\n• Restructuring and reorganization charges are expenses that result from cost reduction initiatives and/or\nsignificant changes to CSG’s business, to include such things as involuntary employee terminations, changes\nin management structure, divestitures of businesses, facility consolidations and abandonments, and\nfundamental reorganizations impacting operational focus and direction. These charges are not considered\nreflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. The exclusion of these items in calculating CSG’s\nnon-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s\ncurrent financial results with historical and future periods.\n• Executive transition costs include expenses incurred related to a departure of a CSG executive officer under\nthe terms of the related separation agreement. These types of costs are not considered reflective of CSG’s\nrecurring business operating results. The exclusion of these costs in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial\nmeasures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results\nwith historical and future periods.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 11\n• Acquisition-related expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, earn-out compensation, and\ntransaction-related costs. Transaction-related costs, which typically include expenses related to legal,\naccounting, and other professional services, are direct and incremental expenses related to business\nacquisitions, and thus, are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. The total\namount of acquisition-related expenses can vary significantly between periods based on the number and size\nof acquisition activities, previously acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized, and ultimate\nrealization of earn-out compensation. In addition, the timing of these expenses may not directly correlate\nwith underlying performance of the CSG’s operations. Therefore, the exclusion of acquisition-related\nexpenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an\nadditional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods.\n• Stock-based compensation results from CSG’s issuance of equity awards to its employees under incentive\ncompensation programs. The amount of this incentive compensation in any period is not generally linked to\nthe level of performance by employees or CSG. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-\nGAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash\nexpense related to compensation included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this\nitem allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business.\n• Gains and losses related to the extinguishment/conversion of debt can be as a result of the refinancing of\nCSG’s credit agreement and/or repurchase, conversion, or settlement of CSG’s convertible notes. These\nactivities, to include any derivative activity related to debt conversions, are not considered reflective of CSG’s\nrecurring business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss is generally non-cash income or expense,\nand therefore, the exclusion of these items allows investors to further evaluate the cash impact of these\nactivities for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these gains and losses in\ncalculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s\ncurrent operating results with historical and future periods.\n• Gains or losses related to the acquisition or disposition of certain of CSG’s business activities are not\nconsidered reflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss is generally\nnon-cash income or expense, and therefore, the exclusion of these items allows investors to further evaluate\nthe cash impact of these activities for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these\ngains and losses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional\nmeans to compare CSG’s current operating results with historical and future periods.\n• Unusual items within CSG’s quarterly and/or annual income tax expense can occur from such things as\nincome tax accounting timing matters, income taxes related to unusual events, or as a result of different\ntreatment of certain items for book accounting and income tax purposes. Consideration of such items in\ncalculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to\ncompare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 12\nCSG also reports non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP free cash flow. Management believes non-GAAP\nadjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to investors in evaluating CSG’s operating performance, debt servicing\ncapabilities, and enterprise valuation. CSG defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as income before interest, income\ntaxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction adjustments, acquisition-\nrelated expenses, and unusual items, such as restructuring and reorganization charges, executive transition costs,\ngains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt, and gains and losses on acquisitions or dispositions, as\ndiscussed above. Additionally, management uses non-GAAP free cash flow, among other measures, to assess its\nfinancial performance and cash generating capabilities, and believes that it is useful to investors because it shows\nCSG’s cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase its common stock,\npay cash dividends, and fund ongoing operations. CSG defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash flows from\noperating activities less the purchases of software, property and equipment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin Percentage:\nThe reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income, and calculation of CSG’s non-GAAP\nadjusted operating margin percentage, for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nGAAP operating income ................................................ $ 31,822 $ 32,731 $ 89,039 $ 99,130\nRestructuring and reorganization charges (1) ............... 2,943 1,152 12,040 8,421\nExecutive transition costs .............................................. - 1,148 352 1,148\nAcquisition-related expenses:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets ............. 3,929 2,996 10,174 9,203\nEarn-out compensation .......................................... 2,591 - 3,416 (14 )\nTransaction-related costs ....................................... 32 (40 ) 243 2,136\nStock-based compensation (1) ...................................... 8,759 7,216 25,821 21,640\nNon-GAAP operating income......................................... $ 50,076 $ 45,203 $ 141,085 $ 141,664\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin Percentage\nRevenue ......................................................................... $ 295,143 $ 286,868 $ 880,596 $ 871,934\nLess: Transaction fees (2) ............................................

          "content": "EXHIBIT 2\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nDISCLOSURES FOR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Limitations\nTo supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP), CSG uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP adjusted operating margin\npercentage, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP free cash flow. CSG believes that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial measures, provide\ninvestors with greater transparency to the information used by CSG’s management in its financial and operational\ndecision making. CSG uses these non-GAAP financial measures for the following purposes:\n• Certain internal financial planning, reporting, and analysis;\n• Forecasting and budgeting;\n• Certain management compensation incentives; and\n• Communications with CSG’s Board of Directors, stockholders, financial analysts, and investors.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided with the intent of providing investors with the following\ninformation:\n• A more complete understanding of CSG’s underlying operational results, trends, and cash generating\ncapabilities;\n• Consistency and comparability with CSG’s historical financial results; and\n• Comparability to similar companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to\ninvestors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP, and therefore should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial information. Limitations with the use of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures include the following items:\n• Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or\nprinciples;\n• The way in which CSG calculates non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the way in which other\ncompanies calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures;\n• Non-GAAP financial measures do not include all items of income and expense that affect CSG’s\noperations and that are required by GAAP to be included in financial statements;\n• Certain adjustments to CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures result in the exclusion of items that are\nrecurring and will be reflected in CSG’s financial statements in future periods; and\n• Certain charges excluded from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures are cash expenses, and therefore\ndo impact CSG’s cash position.\nCSG compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial\nmeasures as a supplement only. Additionally, CSG provides specific information regarding the treatment of GAAP\namounts considered in preparing the non-GAAP financial measures and reconciles each non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 2\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures: Basis of Presentation\nThe table below outlines the exclusions from CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures:\nAdjusted Operating\nNon-GAAP Exclusions Operating Income Margin Percentage EPS\nTransaction fees..................................................... — X —\nRestructuring and reorganization charges ............. X X X\nExecutive transition costs ...................................... X X X\nAcquisition-related expenses:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets ....... X X X\nEarn-out compensation ..................................... X X X\nTransaction-related costs .................................. X X X\nStock-based compensation .................................... X X X\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment/conversion ..... — — X\nGain (loss) on acquisitions or dispositions ............. — — X\nUnusual income tax matters .................................. — — X\nCSG believes that excluding certain items in calculating its non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful\nsupplemental information regarding CSG’s performance and these items are excluded for the following reasons:\n• Transaction fees are primarily comprised of fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial\ninstitutions and interchange fees under CSG’s payment services contracts. Transaction fees are included in\nrevenue in CSG’s Income Statement (and not netted against revenue) because CSG maintains control and\nacts as principal over the integrated service provided under its payment services customer contracts.\nHowever, CSG excludes expense associated with transaction fees from the numerator and denominator in\ncalculating its non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage in order to provide comparability with\nhistorical and future periods and with its peer group and competitors.\n• Restructuring and reorganization charges are expenses that result from cost reduction initiatives and/or\nsignificant changes to CSG’s business, to include such things as involuntary employee terminations, changes\nin management structure, divestitures of businesses, facility consolidations and abandonments, and\nfundamental reorganizations impacting operational focus and direction. These charges are not considered\nreflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. The exclusion of these items in calculating CSG’s\nnon-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s\ncurrent financial results with historical and future periods.\n• Executive transition costs include expenses incurred related to a departure of a CSG executive officer under\nthe terms of the related separation agreement. These types of costs are not considered reflective of CSG’s\nrecurring business operating results. The exclusion of these costs in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial\nmeasures allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s current financial results\nwith historical and future periods.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 3\n• Acquisition-related expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets, earn-out compensation, and\ntransaction-related costs. Transaction-related costs, which typically include expenses related to legal,\naccounting, and other professional services, are direct and incremental expenses related to business\nacquisitions, and thus, are not considered reflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. The total\namount of acquisition-related expenses can vary significantly between periods based on the number and size\nof acquisition activities, previously acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized, and ultimate\nrealization of earn-out compensation. In addition, the timing of these expenses may not directly correlate\nwith underlying performance of the CSG’s operations. Therefore, the exclusion of acquisition-related\nexpenses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an\nadditional means to compare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods.\n• Stock-based compensation results from CSG’s issuance of equity awards to its employees under incentive\ncompensation programs. The amount of this incentive compensation in any period is not generally linked to\nthe level of performance by employees or CSG. The exclusion of these expenses in calculating CSG’s non-\nGAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to evaluate the non-cash\nexpense related to compensation included in CSG’s results of operations, and therefore, the exclusion of this\nitem allows investors to further evaluate the cash generating capabilities of CSG’s business.\n• Gains and losses related to the extinguishment/conversion of debt can be as a result of the refinancing of\nCSG’s credit agreement and/or repurchase, conversion, or settlement of CSG’s convertible notes. These\nactivities, to include any derivative activity related to debt conversions, are not considered reflective of CSG’s\nrecurring business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss is generally non-cash income or expense,\nand therefore, the exclusion of these items allows investors to further evaluate the cash impact of these\nactivities for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these gains and losses in\ncalculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional means to compare CSG’s\ncurrent operating results with historical and future periods.\n• Gains or losses related to the acquisition or disposition of certain of CSG’s business activities are not\nconsidered reflective of CSG’s recurring business operating results. Any resulting gain or loss is generally\nnon-cash income or expense, and therefore, the exclusion of these items allows investors to further evaluate\nthe cash impact of these activities for cash flow and liquidity purposes. In addition, the exclusion of these\ngains and losses in calculating CSG’s non-GAAP EPS allows management and investors an additional\nmeans to compare CSG’s current operating results with historical and future periods.\n• Unusual items within CSG’s quarterly and/or annual income tax expense can occur from such things as\nincome tax accounting timing matters, income taxes related to unusual events, or as a result of different\ntreatment of certain items for book accounting and income tax purposes. Consideration of such items in\ncalculating CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures allows management and investors an additional means to\ncompare CSG’s current financial results with historical and future periods\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 4\nCSG also reports non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP free cash flow. Management believes non-GAAP\nadjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to investors in evaluating CSG’s operating performance, debt servicing\ncapabilities, and enterprise valuation. CSG defines non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as income before interest, income\ntaxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency transaction adjustments, acquisition-\nrelated expenses, and unusual items, such as restructuring and reorganization charges, executive transition costs,\ngains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt, and gains and losses on acquisitions or dispositions, as\ndiscussed above. Additionally, management uses non-GAAP free cash flow, among other measures, to assess its\nfinancial performance and cash generating capabilities, and believes that it is useful to investors because it shows\nCSG’s cash available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, repurchase its common stock,\npay cash dividends, and fund ongoing operations. CSG defines non-GAAP free cash flow as net cash flows from\noperating activities less the purchases of software, property and equipment.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin Percentage:\nThe reconciliation of GAAP operating income to non-GAAP operating income, and calculation of CSG’s non-GAAP\nadjusted operating margin percentage, for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nGAAP operating income ................................................ $ 31,822 $ 32,731 $ 89,039 $ 99,130\nRestructuring and reorganization charges (1) ............... 2,943 1,152 12,040 8,421\nExecutive transition costs .............................................. - 1,148 352 1,148\nAcquisition-related expenses:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets ............. 3,929 2,996 10,174 9,203\nEarn-out compensation .......................................... 2,591 - 3,416 (14 )\nTransaction-related costs ....................................... 32 (40 ) 243 2,136\nStock-based compensation (1) ...................................... 8,759 7,216 25,821 21,640\nNon-GAAP operating income......................................... $ 50,076 $ 45,203 $ 141,085 $ 141,664\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Operating Margin Percentage\nRevenue ......................................................................... $ 295,143 $ 286,868 $ 880,596 $ 871,934\nLess: Transaction fees (2) ............................................

Transaction fees are included in\nrevenue in CSG's Income Statement (and not netted against revenue) because CSG maintains control and\nacts as principal over the integrated service provided under its payment services customer contracts.\nHowever, CSG excludes expense associated with transaction fees from the numerator and denominator in\ncalculating its non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage in order to provide comparability with\nhistorical and future periods and with its peer group and competitors.\nCSG Systems International, Inc.\nNovember 6, 2024\nPage 5\nNon-GAAP EPS:\nThe reconciliations of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP EPS for the indicated periods are as follows (in thousands, except\nper share amounts):\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAmounts EPS (4) Amounts EPS (4)\nGAAP net income ...................................................... $ 19,088 $ 0.67 $ 18,694 $ 0.62\nGAAP income tax provision (3) .................................. 4,691 7,989\nGAAP income before income taxes ........................... 23,779 26,683\nRestructuring and reorganization charges (1) ........... 2,943 1,152\nExecutive transition costs .......................................... - 1,148\nAcquisition-related costs:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets ......... 3,929 2,996\nEarn-out compensation ...................................... 2,591 -\nTransaction-related costs ................................... 32 (40 )\nStock-based compensation (1) .................................. 8,759 7,216\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes ................... 42,033 39,155\nNon-GAAP income tax provision (3) ..........................

GENERAL\nWe have prepared the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.”) (“GAAP”) for interim financial information, and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring\nadjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and operating results have been included. The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements”) should be read in\nconjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, together with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 (our “2023 10-K”), filed with the SEC. The results of operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the expected results for the entire year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of our Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue. The majority of our future revenue is related to our customer contracts for our SaaS and related solutions that include variable consideration dependent upon a series of monthly volumes and/or daily usage of services and have\ncontractual terms ending from 2024 through 2036. Our customer contracts may include guaranteed minimums and fixed monthly or annual fees. As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the\nremaining performance obligations was approximately $1.3 billion, which is made up of fixed fee consideration and guaranteed minimums expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or\npartially unsatisfied). We expect to recognize over 70% of this amount by the end of 2026, with the remaining amount recognized by the end of 2036. We have excluded from this amount variable consideration expected to be recognized in\nthe future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.\nThe nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and how revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors is most appropriately depicted by revenue type, geographic region, and customer vertical.\nRevenue by type for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSaaS and related solutions $ 263,701 $ 250,777 $ 788,054 $ 764,253\nSoftware and services 19,705 23,578 56,780 73,235\nMaintenance 11,737 12,513 35,762 34,446\nTotal revenue $ 295,143 $ 286,868 $ 880,596 $ 871,934\nWe use the location of the customer as the basis of attributing revenue to geographic regions. Revenue by geographic region for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as a percentage of our total revenue, was\nas follows:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAmericas (principally the U.S.) 88% 86% 88% 86%\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 9% 9% 8% 10%\nAsia Pacific 3% 5% 4% 4%\nTotal revenue 100% 100% 100% 100%\n9\nWe generate our revenue primarily from the global communications markets; however, we serve an expanding group of customers in other markets including retail, financial services, healthcare, insurance, and government entities. Revenue\nby customer vertical for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as a percentage of our total revenue, was as follows:\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBroadband/Cable/Satellite 53% 53% 52% 53%\nTelecommunications 18% 20% 18% 20%\nOther 29% 27% 30% 27%\nTotal revenue 100% 100% 100% 100%\nDeferred revenue recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $8.6 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Deferred revenue recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $38.4\nmillion and $39.3 million, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less as of the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our cash\nequivalents consist primarily of institutional money market funds and time deposits held at major banks. For the cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material\namounts being unavailable for use in running our business, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences.\nRestricted Cash. Restricted cash includes cash that is legally or contractually restricted, as well as our settlement and merchant reserve assets (discussed below). The nature of the restrictions on our settlement and merchant reserve assets\nconsists of contractual restrictions with the merchants and restrictions arising from our policy and intention. It has historically been our policy to segregate settlement and merchant reserve assets from our operating cash balances and our\nintention is to continue to do so. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $1.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of restricted cash that mainly serves to collateralize bank and performance guarantees included in other\ncurrent and non-current assets in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (“Balance Sheets” or “Balance Sheet”).\nSettlement and Merchant Reserve Assets and Liabilities. Settlement assets and settlement liabilities represent cash collected on behalf of merchants via payments processing services which is held for an established holding period until\nsettlement with the customer. The holding period is generally one to four business days depending on the payment model and contractual terms with the customer. During the holding period, cash is subject to restriction and segregation\nbased on the nature of our custodial relationship with the merchants. Should we fail to remit these funds to our merchants, the merchant's sole recourse for payment would be against us. These rights and obligations are set forth in the\ncontracts between us and the merchants. Settlement assets are held with various major financial institutions and a corresponding liability is recorded for the amounts owed to the customer. At any given time, there may be differences\nbetween the cash held and the corresponding liability due to the timing of operating-related cash transfers.\nMerchant reserve assets/liabilities represent deposits collected from merchants to mitigate our risk of loss due to nonperformance of settlement obligations initiated by those merchants using our payments processing services, or non-\npayment by customers for services rendered by us. We perform a credit risk evaluation on each customer based on multiple criteria, which provides the basis for the deposit amount required for each merchant. For the duration of our\nrelationship with each merchant, we hold their reserve deposits with major financial institutions. We hold these funds in separate accounts, which are offset by corresponding liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes our settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities as of the indicated periods (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets Liabilities Assets Liabilities\nSettlement assets/liabilities $ 228,679 $ 226,684 $ 260,712 $ 259,825\nMerchant reserve assets/liabilities 12,076 12,099 13,987 13,992\nTotal $ 240,755 $ 238,783 $ 274,699 $ 273,817\n10\nFinancial Instruments. Our financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include cash and cash equivalents, settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and\ndebt. Due to their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash equivalents, settlement and merchant reserve assets and liabilities, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value.\nWe have chosen not to record our debt at fair value, with changes recognized in earnings each reporting period. The following table indicates the carrying value and estimated fair value of our debt as of the indicated periods (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\n2023 Convertible Notes (par value) $ 425,000 $ 425,978 $ 425,000 $ 428,506\n2021 Credit Agreement (carrying value including\ncurrent maturities) 127,500 127,500 133,125 133,125\nThe fair value of our convertible notes was estimated based upon quoted market prices or recent sales activity, while the fair value of our credit agreement was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology, both of which are\nconsidered Level 2 inputs. See Note 4 for a discussion regarding our debt.\nPillar Two. Numerous foreign jurisdictions have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to adopt a minimum effective tax rate. Pillar Two, which was established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n(OECD), generally provides for a 15% minimum effective tax rate for multinational enterprises in every jurisdiction in which they operate. The U.S. has not yet adopted Pillar Two, however, various other governments around the world have.\nThese rules did not have a material impact on our taxes for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to monitor evolving tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Effective. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280), (“ASU 2023-07”), which enhances reportable segment disclosure requirements in part by\nrequiring entities to disclose significant expenses related to their reportable segments. ASU 2023-07 also requires disclosure of the title and position of the company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and how the CODM uses\nfinancial reporting to assess segment performance and allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The\nadoption of this standard only impacts disclosures and is not expected to have a material impact on our Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which requires entities to disclose more detailed information about their effective tax rate\nreconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The adoption of this standard only impacts disclosures and is not expected to have a material impact\non our Financial Statements.\n3. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nJanuary 1, 2024, balance $ 308,596\nEffects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 4,191\nGoodwill acquired during the period 10,662\nSeptember 30, 2024, balance $ 323,449\nGoodwill acquired during the period relates to the acquisitions discussed in Note 5.\nOther Intangible Assets. Our other intangible assets subject to ongoing amortization consist of acquired customer contracts and software. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values of these assets were as\nfollows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccumulated Accumulated\nGross Carrying Amount Amortization Net Amount Gross Carrying Amount Amortization Net Amount\nAcquired customer contracts $ 177,528 $ (134,742) $ 42,786 $ 162,348 $ (126,469) $ 35,879\nSoftware 191,761 (168,808) 22,953 171,825 (157,601) 14,224\nTotal other intangible assets $ 369,289 $ (303,550) $ 65,739 $ 334,173 $ (284,070) $ 50,103\nAcquired customer contracts and software as of September 30, 2024 include the assets acquired as part of the acquisitions discussed in Note 5.\n11\nThe total amortization expense related to other intangible assets for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was $7.1 million and $6.4 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $18.8 million and\n$19.5 million, respectively. Based on the September 30, 2024 net carrying value of our intangible assets, the estimated total amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December 31 is: 2024 - $25.7 million;\n2025 - $21.9 million; 2026 - $15.1 million; 2027 - $7.0 million; and 2028 - $4.3 million.\nCustomer Contract Costs. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying values of our customer contract cost assets, related to those contracts with a contractual term greater than one year, were as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Carrying Amount\nA Ac mc ou rm tiu zala tt ioed\nn Net Amount Gross Carrying Amount\nA Ac mc ou rm tiu zala tt ioed\nn Net Amount\nCustomer contract costs $ 107,131 $ (46,641) $ 60,490 $ 96,515 $ (42,094) $ 54,421\nThe total amortization expense related to customer contract costs for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was $5.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $16.1 million and\n$14.4 million, respectively.\n4. DEBT\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our long-term debt was as follows (in thousands):\nSepte 2m 02b 4er 30, Dece 2m 0b 2e 3r 31,\n2023 Convertible Notes:\n2023 Convertible Notes – senior unsecured convertible notes, due\nSeptember 2028, cash interest at 3.875% $ 425,000 $ 425,000\nLess – deferred financing costs (11,279) (13,216)\n2023 Convertible Notes, net of unamortized discounts 413,721 411,784\n2021 Credit Agreement:\n2021 Term Loan, due September 2026, interest at adjusted SOFR plus\napplicable margin (combined rate of 6.079% at September 30, 2024) 127,500 133,125\nLess – deferred financing costs (1,735) (2,412)\n2021 Term Loan, net of unamortized discounts 125,765 130,713\n$450 million revolving loan facility, due September 2026, interest at adjusted\nSOFR plus applicable margin - -\nTotal debt, net of unamortized discounts 539,486 542,497\nCurrent portion of long-term debt (7,500) (7,500)\nLong-term debt, net of unamortized discounts $ 531,986 $ 534,997\n2023 Convertible Notes. The 2023 Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders before June 15, 2028, upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after June 15, 2028, and until the close of business on the second\nscheduled trading day immediately preceding September 15, 2028, the maturity date, noteholders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time regardless of these conditions.\nThe 2023 Convertible Notes will be convertible at an initial conversion rate of 14.0753 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $71.05 per\nshare of our common stock, plus carryforward adjustments not yet effected pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2023 Convertible Notes. Under the terms of the 2023 Convertible Notes, we will adjust the conversion rate for\nany quarterly dividends exceeding $0.28 per share.\nWe are required to satisfy our conversion obligation as follows: (i) paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted; and (ii) to the extent the value of our conversion obligation exceeds the par value, we will satisfy\nthe remaining conversion obligation in our common stock, cash, or a combination thereof, at our election. As of September 30, 2024, none of the conditions to early convert have been met.\nWe may not redeem the 2023 Convertible Notes prior to September 21, 2026. On or after September 21, 2026, we may redeem for cash all or part of the 2023 Convertible Notes, subject to a partial redemption limitation that requires at least\n$100.0 million of the principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes to remain outstanding if the last reported sales price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether\nor not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The\nredemption price will equal the principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund has been established for the 2023 Convertible Notes.\n12\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2023 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2023 Convertible Notes and other financial\ninstitutions (collectively, the “Option Counterparties”). As of September 30, 2024, all the Capped Call Transactions were outstanding and cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2023\nConvertible Notes, 5.98 million shares of our common stock, the same number of shares of common stock underlying the 2023 Convertible Notes. The Capped Call Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the 2023 Convertible Notes.\n2021 Credit Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made $5.6 million of principal repayments on our $150.0 million aggregate principal five-year term loan (the “2021 Term Loan”). As of September 30, 2024, we\nhad no borrowings outstanding on our $450.0 million aggregate principal five-year revolving loan facility (the \"2021 Revolver\"), and had issued standby letters of credit of $1.5 million that count against our available 2021 Revolver balance,\nleaving $448.5 million available to us.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our interest rate on the 2021 Term Loan was 6.079% (adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1.375% per annum), effective through December 2024, and our\ncommitment fee on the 2021 Revolver was 0.15%.\nThe interest rates under the 2021 Credit Agreement are based upon our choice of an adjusted SOFR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.375% - 2.125%, or an alternate base rate (“ABR”) plus an applicable margin of 0.375% - 1.125%, with\nthe applicable margin determined in accordance with our then-net secured total leverage ratio. We pay a commitment fee of 0.150% - 0.325% of the average daily unused amount of the 2021 Revolver, with the commitment fee rate also\ndetermined in accordance with our then-net secured total leverage ratio.\nOther. We finance certain of our internal use software. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into two additional financing agreements at a total cost of $10.7 million with payments through 2027. As a result, as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had $9.8 million outstanding under these agreements, of which $4.8 million was included in current liabilities and $5.0 million was included in non-current liabilities in our Balance Sheet. These arrangements are\ntreated as non-cash investing and financing activities for purposes of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (\"Statements of Cash Flows\").\n5. ACQUISITIONS\nPrior Years Acquisition. On October 4, 2021, we acquired DGIT Systems Pty Ltd (“DGIT”), a provider of configure, price and quote (CPQ), and order management solutions for the telecommunications industry. We acquired 100% of the\nequity of DGIT for a purchase price of approximately $16 million, approximately $14 million paid upon close and the remaining consideration of approximately $2 million to be paid through 2025, subject to certain reductions, as applicable.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made deferred purchase price payments of $0.5 million.\nThe DGIT acquisition includes provisions for up to approximately $13 million of potential future earn-out payments. The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and a defined service period and are accounted for as post-\nacquisition compensation, as applicable. The earn-out period was originally through September 30, 2025, but during the third quarter of 2024 was extended through December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued $0.1\nmillion related to the potential earn-out payments.\nCurrent Year Acquisitions. On April 1, 2024, we acquired a customer communication services business that operates in multiple industry verticals. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $15.0 million, which\nconsisted of $11.5 million in cash paid upfront and a non-cash settlement of working capital items of $3.5 million. The results of this acquisition are included in our results of operations for the period subsequent to the acquisition date.\nThe preliminary estimated fair values of assets acquired primarily include goodwill of $6.4 million, acquired customer contracts of $4.3 million, trade accounts receivable of $2.1 million, and liabilities assumed of $2.7 million. The estimated fair\nvalues are considered provisional and are based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date. The provisional measurements of fair value are subject to change, however, such changes are not expected to be significant.\nWe expect to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes.\nOn June 3, 2024, we acquired 100% of the equity of iCheckGateway.com, LLC (“iCG Pay”), an ACH and credit card payment processing company. We acquired iCG Pay to further expand the industry verticals we serve and to provide\nopportunities for the continued growth of our business. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred was $17.6 million in cash paid, subject to customary working capital adjustments.\nThe iCG Pay acquisition includes provisions for up to $15.0 million of potential future earn-out payments. The earn-out payments are tied to performance-based goals and a defined service period and are accounted for as post-acquisition\ncompensation, as applicable. The earn-out period is through June 3, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we accrued $3.5 million related to the potential earn-out payments. The results of iCG Pay are included in our results of operations for\nthe period subsequent to the acquisition date.\n13\nThe preliminary estimated fair values of assets acquired primarily include settlement assets of $45.9 million, acquired customer contracts of $10.7 million, goodwill of $4.2 million, and settlement liabilities assumed of $44.7 million. The\nestimated fair values are considered provisional and are based on the information that was available as of the acquisition date. The provisional measurements of fair value are subject to change, however, such changes are not expected to\nbe significant. We expect to finalize the valuation and complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The amount allocated to goodwill is deductible for income tax\npurposes.\nThe cash paid for the acquisitions discussed above, less cash and settlement assets acquired, resulted in net cash provided by business combinations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $17.3 million on our Statement of Cash\nFlows.\n6. RESTRUCTURING AND REORGANIZATION CHARGES\nDuring the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we recorded restructuring and reorganization charges of $2.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded restructuring and\nreorganization charges of $12.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reduced our global workforce by approximately 300 employees, as part of initiatives to better align and allocate resources to areas of the business where we have identified growth\nopportunities. As a result, we incurred restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $9.6 million.\nThe activity in the restructuring and reorganization reserves during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was as follows (in thousands):\nTermination Benefits Other Total\nJanuary 1, 2024, balance $ 1,434 $ 8,100 $ 9,534\nCharged to expense during period 9,593 2,447 12,040\nCash payments (10,311) (7,589) (17,900)\nAdjustment for accelerated depreciation - (438) (438)\nOther 1,180 - 1,180\nSeptember 30, 2024, balance $ 1,896 $ 2,520 $ 4,416\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $5.6 million related to the exit of two reseller agreements that were acquired with the acquisition of Forte Payment Systems, Inc. in 2018.\nAs of September 30, 2024, $3.2 million of the restructuring and reorganization reserves were included in current liabilities.\n7. COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nGuarantees. In the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees in the form of bid bonds or performance bonds. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.8 million of restricted assets used to collateralize these guarantees, which\nare included in other non-current assets in our Balance Sheet.\nWe have performance guarantees in the form of surety bonds and standby letters of credit, along with money transmitter bonds, issued through third-parties that are not required to be reflected on our Balance Sheets. As of September 30,\n2024, we had performance guarantees of $7.4 million, which includes $1.5 million in standby letters of credit and $1.0 million in bid bonds. We are ultimately liable for claims that may occur against these guarantees. We have no history of\nmaterial claims or are aware of circumstances that would require us to pay under any of these arrangements. We also believe that the resolution of any claim that may arise in the future, either individually or in the aggregate, would not be\nmaterial to our Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2024, we had total aggregate money transmitter bonds of $22.0 million outstanding. These money transmitter bonds are for the benefit of various states to comply with the states’\nfinancial requirements and industry regulations for money transmitter licenses.\nWarranties. We generally warrant that our solutions and related offerings will conform to published specifications, or to specifications provided in an individual customer arrangement, as applicable. The typical warranty period is 90 days from\nthe date of acceptance of the solution or offering. For certain service offerings we provide a warranty for the duration of the services provided. We generally warrant that those services will be performed in a professional and skillful manner.\nThe typical remedy for breach of warranty is to correct or replace any defective deliverable, and if not possible or practical, we will accept the return of the defective deliverable and refund the amount paid under the customer arrangement that\nis allocable to the defective deliverable. Our contracts also generally contain limitation of damages provisions in an effort to reduce our exposure to monetary damages arising from breach of warranty claims. Historically, we have incurred\nminimal warranty costs, and as a result, do not maintain a warranty reserve.\nSolution and Services Indemnifications. Arrangements with our customers generally include an indemnification provision that will indemnify and defend a customer in actions brought against the customer that claim our products and/or\nservices infringe upon a copyright, trade secret, or valid patent. Historically, we have not incurred any significant costs related to such indemnification claims, and as a result, do not maintain a reserve for such exposure.\n14\nClaims for Company Non-performance. Our arrangements with our customers typically limit our liability for breach to a specified amount of the direct damages incurred by the customer resulting from the breach. From time-to-time, these\narrangements may also include provisions for possible liquidated damages or other financial remedies for our non-performance, or in the case of certain of our solutions, provisions for damages related to service level performance\nrequirements. The service level performance requirements typically relate to system availability and timeliness of service delivery. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we have adequate reserves, based on our historical experience, to\ncover any reasonably anticipated exposure as a result of our nonperformance for any past or current arrangements with our customers.\nIndemnifications Related to Officers and the Board of Directors. Other guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless our directors, and certain officers. Such indemnification covers any expenses and liabilities\nreasonably incurred by a person, by reason of the fact that such person is, was, or has agreed to be a director or officer, in connection with the investigation, defense, and settlement of any threatened, pending, or contemplated action, suit,\nproceeding, or claim. We maintain directors’ and officers’ (“D&O”) insurance coverage to protect against such losses. We have not historically incurred any losses related to these types of indemnifications and are not aware of any pending\nor threatened actions or claims against any officer or member of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\"). As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities related to such indemnifications as of September 30, 2024. In addition, as a result of the\ninsurance policy coverage, we believe these indemnification agreements are not significant to our results of operations.\nLegal Proceedings. From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.\n8. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) amounts are presented on the face of our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (the \"Income Statements\").\nThe reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS denominators related to common shares is included in the following table (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBasic weighted-average common shares 28,362 30,097 28,475 30,381\nDilutive effect of restricted common stock 106 187 146 159\nDiluted weighted-average common shares 28,468 30,284 28,621 30,540\nThe dilutive effect of restricted common stock is computed using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of the 2023 Convertible Notes is computed using the if-converted method and will only have an effect in those quarterly periods in\nwhich our average stock price exceeds the current effective conversion price.\nPotentially dilutive common shares related to non-participating unvested restricted stock and stock warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS, as the effect was anti-dilutive, and were not material in any period presented.\n9. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nStock Repurchase Program. We currently have a stock repurchase program, approved by our Board, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time-to-time as market and business conditions warrant (the “Stock\nRepurchase Program”). During the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 313,000 shares of our common stock for $14.4 million (weighted-average price of $46.11 per share), and\napproximately 716,000 shares of our common stock for $33.7 million (weighted-average price of $47.07 per share), respectively, under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 Plan. During the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we\nrepurchased approximately 1,991,000 shares of our common stock for $107.0 million (weighted-average price of $53.73 per share), which includes approximately 311,000 shares of our common stock that were repurchased for $16.9 million\n(weighted average price of $54.36 per share) under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 Plan, and approximately 1,680,000 shares of our common stock that were repurchased for $90.1 million (weighted-average price of $53.62 per share) concurrent with\nthe pricing of the offering of the 2023 Convertible Notes.\nThe excise tax imposed as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is included as a cost of treasury stock, is not reflected in the share repurchase amounts above.\nIn August 2024, our Board authorized an additional $100.0 million of repurchases under the Stock Repurchase Program. This, combined with the remaining value from the prior Board authorization in August 2023, leaves $162.0 million\nremaining value of shares available for repurchase at September 30, 2024, with the amount authorized for repurchase through December 31, 2025.\n15\nStock Repurchases for Tax Withholdings. In addition to the above-mentioned stock repurchases, during the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, we repurchased and then cancelled approximately 3,000 shares of common stock for $0.2 million\nand approximately 3,000 shares of common stock for $0.1 million, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased and then cancelled approximately 172,000 shares of common stock for $9.1\nmillion and approximately 171,000 shares of common stock for $9.6 million, respectively, in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted common stock under our stock incentive plan.\nCash Dividends. During the third quarter of 2024, our Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, totaling $8.8 million. During the third quarter of 2023, our Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of\n$0.28 per share of common stock, totaling $8.7 million. Dividends declared for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $26.4 million for both periods.\nWarrants. In July 2014, in conjunction with the execution of an amendment to our agreement with Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”), we issued stock warrants (the “Warrant Agreement”) for the right to purchase up to 2.9 million shares of our\ncommon stock (the “Stock Warrants”) with an exercise price of $26.68 per warrant as an additional incentive for Comcast to convert customer accounts onto our solutions based on various milestones. The Stock Warrants had a ten-year\nterm and in July 2024, the remaining 1.0 million issued and unvested Stock Warrants expired.\nStock-Based Awards. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we granted restricted stock awards to key members of management in the form of: (i) performance-based awards of approximately 155,000 restricted common stock\nshares, which vest in the first quarter of 2026 upon meeting certain pre-established financial performance objectives over a two-year performance period; and (ii) market-based awards of approximately 52,000 restricted common stock shares,\nwhich vest in the first quarter of 2027 upon meeting a relative total shareholder return performance achievement tier. Certain of these awards may vest (i.e., vesting accelerates) upon the involuntary termination of employment or a change in\ncontrol (as defined) and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we also granted restricted stock awards to key members of management in the form of time-based awards of approximately 496,000 restricted common stock shares, which vest annually\nover three years with no restrictions other than the passage of time. Certain of these awards may vest (i.e., vesting accelerates) upon the involuntary termination of employment, a change in control (as defined) and the subsequent\ninvoluntary termination of employment, or death.\nWe recorded stock-based compensation expense for the third quarters of 2024 and 2023 of $8.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of $25.0 million and $21.3 million,\nrespectively.\n16\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe information contained in this MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in our 2023 10-K.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains a number of forward-looking statements relative to our future plans and our expectations concerning our business and the industries we serve. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions about a\nnumber of important factors and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in the forward-looking statements. Some of the risks that are foreseen by management are outlined\nwithin Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 10-K. Readers are strongly encouraged to review that section closely in conjunction with MD&A.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a purpose-driven SaaS platform company that enables global companies in a wide variety of industry verticals to tackle the ever-growing complexity of business in the digital age.

A summary of our results of operations for the third quarter of 2024, when compared to the third quarter of 2023, is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nRevenue $ 295,143 $ 286,868\nTransaction fees (1) 22,524 20,314\nOperating Results:\nOperating income $ 31,822 $ 32,731\nOperating margin percentage 10.8% 11.4%\nDiluted EPS $ 0.67 $ 0.62\nSupplemental Data:\nRestructuring and reorganization charges (2) $ 2,943 $ 1,152\nExecutive transition costs - 1,148\nAcquisition-related costs:\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 3,929 2,996\nEarn-out compensation 2,591 -\nTransaction-related costs 32 (40)\nStock-based compensation (2) 8,759 7,216\n(1) Transaction fees are primarily comprised of fees paid to third-party payment processors and financial institutions and interchange fees under our payment services contracts.\nTransaction fees are included in revenue in our Income Statement (and not netted against revenue) because we maintain control and act as the principal over the integrated service\nprovided under our payment services customer contracts.\n(2) Restructuring and reorganization charges include stock-based compensation, which is not included in the stock-based compensation line in the table above, and depreciation, which\nhas not been recorded to the depreciation line on our Income Statement.\nRevenue. Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $295.1 million, a 2.9% increase when compared to revenue of $286.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in revenue is primarily attributed to continued growth of our SaaS\nand related solutions revenue to include the revenue generated from the businesses acquired in the second quarter of 2024, which more than offset lower software and services revenue for the quarter.\nOperating Results. Operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $31.8 million, or a 10.8% operating margin percentage, compared to $32.7 million, or an 11.4% operating margin percentage for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease\nin operating income is mainly attributed to the increase in acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, to include earn-out compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nDiluted EPS. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.67 compared to $0.62 for the third quarter of 2023, with the third quarter of 2024 benefiting from a lower effective income tax rate and a lower share count, partially offset by\nforeign currency movements.\nCash and Cash Flows. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $118.4 million, as compared to $110.4 million as of June 30, 2024 and $186.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating\nactivities for the third quarter of 2024 were $39.5 million. See the Liquidity section below for further discussion of our cash flows.\nSignificant Customer Relationships\nA large percentage of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers in the global communications industry, with our three largest customers being Charter Communications Inc. (“Charter”), Comcast, and DISH Network L.L.C.\nCustomer Concentration. We have significant customer concentration, with the following two customers exceeding 10% of our revenue (in thousands, except percentages):\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAmount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue\nCharter $ 59,070 20% $ 60,629 21% $ 59,432 21%\nComcast 58,688 20% 54,576 19% 53,653 19%\n18\nThe percentages of net billed accounts receivable balances attributable to these customers as of the dates indicated were as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCharter 20% 22% 23%\nComcast 16% 18% 17%\nSee our 2023 10-K for additional discussion of our business relationships and contractual terms with Charter and Comcast.\nComcast. On October 30, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our current agreement with Comcast (the “Amended Agreement”). The key terms of the Amended Agreement are as follows:\n• The Amended Agreement extends our contractual relationship with Comcast through December 31, 2030.\n• The fees to be generated under the Amended Agreement will be based primarily on monthly charges for SaaS and related solutions per Comcast residential customer account, and various other ancillary services based on\nactual usage. The Amended Agreement includes annual price escalators beginning in 2026 and certain of the per-unit fees include volume-based pricing tiers. We did not provide a renewal discount to Comcast in the\nAmended Agreement.\n• The Amended Agreement contains certain financial commitments associated with the number of Comcast residential customer accounts that are to be processed on our solutions.\n• We maintain the exclusive right to provide print and mail services to all Comcast residential customer accounts through the term of the Amended Agreement.\n• The Amended Agreement contains certain rights and obligations of both parties, including the following key items: (i) the termination of the agreement under certain conditions; (ii) various service level commitments; and (iii)\nremedies and limitations on liabilities associated with specified breaches of contractual obligations.\nA copy of the Amended Agreement, with confidential information redacted, will be filed as an exhibit to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nRisk of Customer Concentration. We expect to continue to generate a large percentage of our future revenue from a limited number of customers. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenue is concentrated with a\nlimited number of customers. Should a significant customer: (i) terminate or fail to renew their contracts with us, in whole or in part, for any reason; (ii) significantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our solutions, the\nprice paid for our services, or the scope of services that we provide; or (iii) experience financial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to select appropriate accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying our\naccounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Financial Statements.\nWe have identified the most critical accounting policies that affect our financial position and the results of our operations. Those critical accounting policies were determined by considering the accounting policies that involve the most\ncomplex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting policies identified relate to the following items: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) impairment assessments of long-lived assets; (iii) income taxes; and (iv) loss\ncontingencies. These critical accounting policies, as well as our other significant accounting policies, are discussed in our 2023 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue. Total revenue for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $295.1 million, a 2.9% increase when compared to $286.9 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $880.6 million, a 1.0% increase\nwhen compared to $871.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n19\nRevenue by type for the third quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSaaS and related solutions $ 263,701 $ 250,777 $ 788,054 $ 764,253\nSoftware and services 19,705 23,578 56,780 73,235\nMaintenance 11,737 12,513 35,762 34,446\nTotal revenue $ 295,143 $ 286,868 $ 880,596 $ 871,934\nThe increases in revenue are primarily attributed to continued growth of our SaaS and related solutions revenue, to include the revenue generated from the businesses acquired during the second quarter of 2024 (see Note 5 to our Financial\nStatements). These acquired businesses contributed approximately $6 million and $9 million, respectively, of revenue during the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were offset to a certain degree by\nlower software and services revenue, to include the software license revenue resulting from the closure of approximately $10 million of license upgrades in the first quarter of 2023.\nWe use the location of the customer as the basis of attributing revenue to individual countries. Revenue by geographic regions for the third quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAmericas (principally the U.S.) $ 258,620 $ 246,880 $ 771,193 $ 746,299\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 26,381 25,502 72,199 88,795\nAsia Pacific 10,142 14,486 37,204 36,840\nTotal revenue $ 295,143 $ 286,868 $ 880,596 $ 871,934\nTotal Operating Expenses. Total operating expenses for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 were $263.3 million, a 3.6% increase when compared to $254.1 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 were\n$791.6 million, a 2.4% increase when compared to $772.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in total operating expenses are a result of the higher SaaS and related solutions revenue between periods and\nthe additional costs from the acquired businesses, to include acquired intangible asset amortization and earn-out compensation, in addition to the increases in restructuring and reorganization charges, discussed below.\nThe components of total operating expenses are discussed in more detail below.\nCost of Revenue (Exclusive of Depreciation). The cost of revenue for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $149.5 million, a 2.1% decrease when compared to $152.7 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30,\n2024 was $460.3 million, a 0.3% increase when compared to $458.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• The decrease in cost of revenue during the third quarter of 2024 is mainly attributed to lower employee-related costs, due to the reallocation of resources to development projects and an increase in deferred costs related\nto SaaS implementation projects. This decrease is partially offset by the increased costs reflective of the increase in SaaS and related solutions revenue between periods, to include the acquired businesses.\n• The increase in cost of revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is reflective of the increase in SaaS and related solutions revenue year-over-year, to include the acquired businesses, offset by a\ndecrease in employee-related costs, due to the reallocation of resources to development projects, and an increase in deferred costs related to SaaS implementation projects.\nTotal cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 50.6% and 53.2%, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 52.3% and 52.6%, respectively.\n20\nR&D Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation). R&D expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $41.7 million, an 18.1% increase when compared to $35.3 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas $116.2 million, an 8.2% increase when compared to $107.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in R&D expense between periods are mainly attributed to increased employee-related costs. During\n2024 our R&D investment increased from prior periods as a result of the continued development of our SaaS platforms as we gain further traction in new industry verticals along with the integration of the recently acquired businesses into our\nsolutions. These investments are focused on the continued evolution of our solutions that enable us to launch, monetize, and scale new digital services quickly and across any channel, while delivering an exceptional customer experience.\nAs a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 14.1% and 12.3%, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 13.2% and 12.3%, respectively.\nSelling, General, and Administrative (\"SG&A\") Expense (Exclusive of Depreciation). SG&A expense for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $63.9 million, an 8.1% increase when compared to $59.1 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii)\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was $186.8 million, a 3.2% increase when compared to $180.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in SG&A expense are mainly attributed to increased employee-\nrelated costs, to include stock-based compensation and acquisition-related earn-out compensation.\nAs a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expense for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 was 21.7% and 20.6%, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 21.2% and 20.8%, respectively.\nRestructuring and Reorganization Charges. Restructuring and reorganization charges for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $2.9 million, a $1.7 million increase when compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was $12.0 million, a $3.6 million increase when compared to $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The restructuring and reorganization charges for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 relate mainly to initiatives to better align and allocate resources to areas of the business where we have identified growth opportunities, which have resulted in restructuring charges related to involuntary terminations of $9.6 million.\nSee Note 6 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion.\nOperating Income. Operating income for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $31.8 million, or 10.8% of total revenue, compared to $32.7 million, or 11.4% of total revenue for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30,\n2024 was $89.0 million, or 10.1% of total revenue, compared to $99.1 million, or 11.4% of total revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• The decrease in operating income for the third quarter of 2024 is mainly attributed to the increase in acquisition-related expenses in the third quarter of 2024, to include earn-out compensation and amortization of\nacquired intangible assets.\n• The decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly attributed to: (i) the higher software license revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2023, as the cost associated with\nthis revenue is not generally dependent upon the timing of deal closures; (ii) the increase in acquisition-related expenses to include earn-out compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets; and (iii) higher\nrestructuring and reorganization charges.\nInterest Income. Interest income for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $1.9 million, a $0.7 million increase when compared to $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.6 million, a $4.1\nmillion increase when compared to $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the increase primarily attributed to certain settlement assets being swept into overnight money market accounts on a daily basis.\nOther, net. Other, net for the: (i) third quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million of other expense, a $3.0 million change when compared to $0.8 million of other income for the third quarter of 2023; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\n$1.5 million of other expense, a $1.5 million change when compared to $3.0 million of other expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, with the changes primarily attributed to foreign currency movements.\nIncome Tax Provision. The effective income tax rates for the: (i) third quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 20% and 30%, respectively; and (ii) nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26% and 29%, respectively. The third quarter\nof 2024 effective income tax rate benefited from the revaluation of certain deferred income taxes. Our estimated full year 2024 effective income tax rate is approximately 28%, consistent with our 2023 full year effective income tax rate.\n21\nLiquidity\nCash and Liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of $118.4 million, compared to $110.4 million as of June 30, 2024, and $186.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\nAs part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a $450.0 million senior secured revolving loan facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in September 2026, the 2021 Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had no\nborrowings outstanding on the 2021 Revolver balance, and have issued standby letters of credit for $1.5 million that count against the available 2021 Revolver balance, leaving $448.5 million available to us. The 2021 Credit Agreement\ncontains customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, and the date of this filing, we believe we are in compliance with the provisions of the 2021 Credit Agreement.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balances as of the end of the indicated periods were located in the following geographical regions (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmericas (principally the U.S.) $ 82,183 $ 142,515\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 24,113 32,974\nAsia Pacific 12,148 10,775\nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 118,444 $ 186,264\nWe generally have ready access to substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign jurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $1.8 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of cash restricted as to use primarily to collateralize guarantees included in our other current and non-current asset balances. In addition,\nas of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $240.8 million and $274.7 million, respectively, of settlement and merchant reserve assets which are deemed restricted due to contractual restrictions with the merchants and\nrestrictions arising from our policy and intention. It has historically been our policy to segregate settlement and merchant reserve assets from our operating cash balances and we intend to continue to do so.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. We calculate our cash flows from operating activities beginning with net income, adding back the impact of non-cash items or non-operating activity (e.g., depreciation, amortization, impairments,\ngain/loss on items such as investments, lease modifications, and debt extinguishments/conversions, unrealized foreign currency transactions gain/loss, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation, etc.), and then factoring in the impact\nof changes in operating assets and liabilities. See our 2023 10-K for a description of the primary uses and sources of our cash flows from operating activities.\nOur cash flows from operating activities, broken out between operations and changes in operating assets and liabilities, for the indicated quarterly periods are as follows (in thousands):\nChanges in Operating Asset and Net Cash Provided by (Used In)\nOperations Liabilities Operating Activities – Totals\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\n2024:\nMarch 31 (1) $ 51,655 $ (81,006) $ (29,351)\nJune 30 35,625 7,480 43,105\nSeptember 30 44,354 (4,895) 39,459\nTotal $ 131,634 $ (78,421) $ 53,213\n2023:\nMarch 31 (2) $ 50,158 $ (34,761) $ 15,397\nJune 30 26,539 (14,153) 12,386\nSeptember 30 34,618 (10,036) 24,582\nTotal $ 111,315 $ (58,950) $ 52,365\n(1) Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by unfavorable working capital changes, to include the impact of the payment of the 2023 year-end accrued employee incentive\ncompensation and timing of trade accounts receivable.\n(2) Cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter 2023 reflect the impact of the payment of the 2022 year-end accrued employee incentive compensation.\n22\nVariations in our net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities are generally related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities (related mostly to fluctuations in timing at quarter-end of customer payments, billing milestones, and\nchanges in accrued expenses), and generally over longer periods of time, do not significantly impact our cash flows from operations.\nSignificant fluctuations in key operating assets and liabilities between 2024 and 2023 that impacted our cash flows from operating activities are as follows:\nBilled Trade Accounts Receivable\nManagement of our billed trade accounts receivable is one of the primary factors in maintaining strong cash flows from operating activities. These balances include significant billings for several non-revenue items (primarily\npostage, sales tax, and deferred revenue items). As a result, we evaluate our performance in collecting our billed trade accounts receivable through our calculation of Days Billings Outstanding (“DBO”) rather than a typical Days\nSales Outstanding (“DSO”) calculation.\nOur gross and net billed trade accounts receivable and related allowance for expected losses (“Allowance”) as of the end of the indicated quarterly periods, and the related DBOs for the quarters then ended, are as follows (in\nthousands, except DBOs):\nQuarter Ended Gross Allowance Net Billed DBOs\n2024:\nMarch 31 $ 281,051 $ (5,692) $ 275,359 67\nJune 30 270,934 (4,720) 266,214 66\nSeptember 30 284,740 (4,810) 279,930 64\n2023:\nMarch 31 $ 261,028 $ (5,254) $ 255,774 68\nJune 30 260,928 (4,618) 256,310 65\nSeptember 30 279,892 (4,731) 275,161 66\nAs of September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately 95% and 93%, respectively, of our net billed trade accounts receivable balances were less than 60 days past due.\nWe may experience adverse impacts to our DBOs if and when customer payment delays occur. However, the recurring monthly payments that cross a reporting period-end do not raise collectability concerns, as payment is\ngenerally received subsequent to quarter-end. All other changes in our gross and net billed accounts receivable reflect the normal fluctuations in the timing of customer payments at quarter-end, as evidenced by our relatively\nconsistent DBO metric.\nAs a global provider of solutions and services, a portion of our trade accounts receivable balance relates to international customers. This diversity in the geographic composition of our customer base may adversely impact our\nDBOs as longer billing cycles (i.e., billing terms and cash collection cycles) are an inherent characteristic of international software and professional services transactions. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our trade\naccounts receivable balance as our ability to invoice and collect arrangement fees is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the completion of various customer administrative matters, local country billing protocols and processes\n(including local cultural differences), and non-customer administrative matters; (ii) meeting certain contractual invoicing milestones and dates; (iii) the overall project status in certain situations in which we act as a subcontractor to\nanother vendor on a project; or (iv) currency controls in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nUnbilled Trade Accounts Receivable\nUnbilled trade accounts receivable increased $0.4 million to $82.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from $82.2 million as of December 31, 2023. These unbilled trade accounts receivable balances relate primarily to large\nimplementation projects where various milestone and contractual billing dates have not yet been reached or are delayed. Unbilled trade accounts receivable are an inherent characteristic of certain software and services\ntransactions and may fluctuate between quarters, as these types of transactions typically have scheduled invoicing terms over several quarters, as well as certain milestone billing events.\nIncome Taxes Payable/Receivable\nNet income taxes payable/receivable (current and non-current) as of September 30, 2024 was a net income taxes receivable balance of $10.4 million, compared to a net income taxes payable balance of $5.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. This net $16.2 million change is primarily due to the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments.\n23\nAccrued Employee Compensation\nAccrued employee compensation decreased $26.7 million to $57.7 million as of September 30, 2024, from $84.4 million as of December 31, 2023, due primarily to the payment of the 2023 employee incentive compensation during\nthe first quarter of 2024 that was fully accrued at December 31, 2023 and the timing of accrued wages, partially offset by the accruals for the 2024 employee incentive compensation.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities. Our typical investing activities consist of purchases of software, property, and equipment, and in 2024, our business combination activities, which are discussed below.\nPurchases of Software, Property, and Equipment\nOur capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for software, property, and equipment were $16.5 million and $22.9 million, respectively, and consisted principally of investments in: (i)\ncommunication design and delivery center equipment and infrastructure; (ii) software and related equipment; (iii) computer hardware; and (iv) lease improvements.\nBusiness Combinations, net of Cash and Settlement Assets Acquired\nThe cash paid for the acquisitions discussed in Note 5 to our Financial Statements, less cash and settlement assets acquired, resulted in net cash provided by business combinations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nof $17.3 million.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities. Our financing activities typically consist of activities with our common stock, various debt-related transactions, and settlement and merchant reserve activity.\nCash Dividends Paid on Common Stock\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Board approved dividends totaling $26.4 million for both periods, and we made dividend payments of $26.6 million and $26.2 million, respectively, with the\ndifferences between the amount approved and paid attributed to dividends accrued on unvested incentive shares that are paid upon vesting.\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased approximately 716,000 and 1,991,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, under our Stock Repurchase Program for $33.7 million and $107.0\nmillion, respectively.\nAdditionally, outside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased from our employees and then canceled approximately 172,000 and 171,000 shares of our\ncommon stock, respectively, for $9.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, in connection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans.\nThrough the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have paid $42.4 million and $116.4 million, respectively, for our total repurchases of common stock, with any differences when compared to the amounts\npurchased attributed to the timing of the settlement and the accrued excise tax imposed as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.\nSee Note 9 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our repurchases of common stock.\nLong-Term Debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made principal repayments on our 2021 Term Loan of $5.6 million during each period. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we\nborrowed and subsequently repaid $15.0 million from our 2021 Revolver for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we borrowed $45.0 million under our 2021 Revolver for general corporate purposes and subsequently repaid $30.0 million. In September 2023, we issued the 2023 Convertible\nNotes offering and received proceeds of $425.0 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to repay $275.0 million of our 2021 Revolver balance and pay the $34.3 million premiums for the Capped Call Transactions.\nAdditionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we paid deferred financing costs of $13.5 million.\nSee Note 4 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our long-term debt.\n24\nSettlement and Merchant Reserve Activity\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had net settlement and merchant reserve activity of $(79.6) million and ($46.2) million, respectively, related to the cash collected, held on behalf, and paid to our\nmerchants related to our payments services and the net change in deposits held on behalf of our merchants. These balances can significantly fluctuate between periods due to activity at the end of the period and the day in which\nthe period ends.\nSee Note 2 to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our settlement and merchant reserves.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements are mainly limited to money transmitter bonds, bid bonds, performance bonds, and standby letters of credit. These arrangements do not have a material impact and are not reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial future impact to our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. See Note 7 to our Financial Statements for additional information on these guarantees.\nCapital Resources\nThe following are the key items to consider in assessing our sources and uses of capital resources:\nCurrent Sources of Capital Resources. Below are the key items to consider in assessing our current sources of capital resources:\n• Cash and Cash Equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $118.4 million, of which approximately 62% was in U.S. dollars and held in the U.S. For the remainder of the monies\ndenominated in foreign currencies and/or located outside the U.S., we do not anticipate any material amounts being unavailable for use in funding our business, but may face limitations on moving cash out of certain foreign\njurisdictions due to currency controls and potential negative economic consequences.\n• Operating Cash Flows. As described in the Liquidity section above, we believe we have the ability to generate strong cash flows to fund our operating activities and act as a source of funds for our capital resource needs,\nalthough we may experience quarterly variations in our cash flows from operations related to the changes in our operating assets and liabilities.\n• Revolving Loan Facility. As part of our 2021 Credit Agreement, we have a $450.0 million revolving loan facility, the 2021 Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the 2021 Revolver and\nissued standby letters of credit for $1.5 million that count against the available 2021 Revolver balance, currently leaving $448.5 million available to us. Our long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to\nour Financial Statements.\nUses/Potential Uses of Capital Resources. Below are the key items to consider in assessing our uses/potential uses of capital resources:\n• Common Stock Repurchases and Cash Dividends. We have made repurchases of our common stock in the past under our Stock Repurchase Program. In August of 2024, our Board authorized an additional $100.0 million of\nrepurchases under our Stock Repurchase Program, with all outstanding authorized repurchases to be completed by December 31, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, we had $162.0 million authorized for repurchase remaining\nunder our Stock Repurchase Program. Our 2021 Credit Agreement places certain limitations on our ability to repurchase our common stock.\nUnder our Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including through an accelerated stock repurchase plan or under a SEC Rule 10b5-1 plan. The\nactual timing and amount of share repurchases are dependent on the current market conditions and other business-related factors. Our common stock repurchases are discussed in more detail in Note 9 to our Financial\nStatements.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 716,000 shares of our common stock for $33.7 million (weighted-average price of $47.07 per share).\nOutside of our Stock Repurchase Program, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased from our employees and then cancelled approximately 172,000 shares of our common stock for $9.1 million in\nconnection with minimum tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted common stock under our stock incentive plans.\n25\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Board declared dividends totaling $26.4 million. Going forward, we expect to pay cash dividends each year in March, June, September, and December, with the amount\nand timing subject to our Board’s approval.\nWe expect to return a total of $100.0 million to our shareholders through combined common stock repurchases and cash dividends in each of 2024 and 2025.\n• Acquisitions. As a result of our previous acquisition activity, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we made $2.5 million of deferred acquisition payments. We expect to pay $0.3 million in 2025 related to these\npast acquisitions. Additionally, there are provisions for up to approximately $13 million of potential future earn-out payments. The earn-out period was originally through September 30, 2025, but during the third quarter of\n2024 was extended through December 31, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued $0.1 million related to potential earn-out payments.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, we acquired two businesses, discussed in further detail in Note 5 to our Financial Statements. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $32.6 million, subject to\ncustomary working capital adjustments. The iCG Pay purchase agreement includes provisions for up to $15.0 million of potential future earn-out payments tied to performance-based goals and a defined service period. The\nearn-out period is through June 3, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we have accrued $3.5 million related to potential earn-out payments. These acquisitions were funded with available cash.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we are continually evaluating potential business and/or asset acquisitions and investments in market share expansion with our existing and potential new customers and expansion into verticals\noutside the global communications market.\n• Exit of Reseller Agreements. During 2023, we exited out of two reseller agreements that were acquired with the 2018 acquisition of Forte Payment Systems, Inc., at a total cost of $9.9 million, of which $1.8 million was paid in\n2023. We paid an additional $5.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Of the remaining $2.5 million, $1.3 million will be paid in 2025 and $1.2 million will be paid in 2026.\n• Capital Expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent $16.5 million on capital expenditures.\n• Financing Agreements. We have financing agreements for certain of our internal use software. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid $2.2 million related to these financing agreements, with an\nadditional $1.4 million to be paid in 2024, $4.6 million to be paid in 2025, $3.6 million to be paid in 2026, and $0.9 million to be paid in 2027.\n• Long-Term Debt. As of September 30, 2024, our long-term debt consisted of the following: (i) 2023 Convertible Notes in the principal aggregate amount of $425.0 million; and (ii) 2021 Credit Agreement term loan borrowings\nof $127.5 million.\n2023 Convertible Notes. The 2023 Convertible Notes are convertible at the option of the note holders before June 15, 2028 upon the occurrence of certain events, however, there are no scheduled conversion triggers over the\nnext twelve months. As a result, we expect our required debt service cash outlay during the next twelve months for the 2023 Convertible Notes to be limited to interest payments of $16.5 million.\n2021 Credit Agreement. The mandatory repayments under our 2021 Credit Agreement for the next twelve months are $7.5 million and the cash interest expense (based upon then-current interest rates) for the 2021 Term\nLoan is $7.7 million. We have the ability to make prepayments without penalties on our 2021 Credit Agreement.\nOur long-term debt obligations are discussed in more detail in Note 4 to our Financial Statements.\nIn summary, we expect to continue to have material needs for capital resources going forward, as noted above. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balances and our 2021 Revolver, together with cash expected to be\ngenerated in the future from our current operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital resource requirements for at least the next twelve months. We believe we could obtain additional capital through other debt sources\nwhich may be available to us if deemed appropriate.\n26\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. As of September 30, 2024, we are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, fluctuations and changes in the market value of\nour cash equivalents and settlement and merchant reserve assets, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have not historically entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLong-Term Debt. The interest rate on our 2023 Convertible Notes is fixed, and thus, as it relates to our convertible debt borrowings, we are not exposed to changes in interest rates.\nThe interest rates on our 2021 Credit Agreement are based upon an adjusted SOFR rate (including a 0.10% credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin, or an ABR plus an applicable margin. See Note 4 to our Financial Statements\nfor further details related to our long-term debt.\nA hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the September 30, 2024 adjusted SOFR rate would not have a material impact upon our results of operations.\nMarket Risk\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $118.4 million and $186.3 million, respectively. Certain of our cash balances are swept into overnight money market\naccounts on a daily basis, and at times, any excess funds are invested in low-risk, somewhat longer term, cash equivalent instruments. Our cash equivalents are invested primarily in institutional money market funds held at major banks. We\nhave minimal market risk for our cash and cash equivalents due to the relatively short maturities of the instruments.\nSettlement and Merchant Reserve Assets. We are exposed to market risk associated with cash held on behalf of our merchants related to our payment processing services. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had\n$240.8 million and $274.7 million, respectively, of cash collected on behalf of our merchants. The cash is held in accounts with various major financial institutions in the U.S. and Canada in an amount equal to at least 100% of the aggregate\namount owed to our merchants. These balances can significantly fluctuate between periods due to activity at the end of the period and the day in which the period ends. Certain settlement assets are swept into overnight money market\naccounts on a daily basis.\nLong-Term Debt. The fair value of our convertible debt is exposed to market risk. We do not carry our convertible debt at fair value but present the fair value for disclosure purposes (see Note 2 to our Financial Statements). Generally, the\nfair value of our convertible debt is impacted by changes in interest rates and changes in the price and volatility of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the 2023 Convertible Notes was estimated at $426.0 million,\nusing quoted market prices.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDue to foreign operations around the world, our financial statements are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk due to the fluctuations in the value of currencies in which we conduct business. Our principal currency exposures include the\nBritish Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, Saudi Riyal, and South African Rand. While we attempt to maximize natural hedges by incurring expenses in the same currency in which we contract revenue, the related expenses for that revenue\ncould be in one or more differing currencies than the revenue stream. In particular, if the U.S. Dollar were to strengthen it would reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, trade receivables, revenue, and\nexpenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 90% of our revenue in U.S. dollars. We expect that, in the foreseeable future, we will continue to generate a very large percentage of our revenue in U.S.\ndollars.\nWe have analyzed our foreign currency exposure as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the September 30, 2024 exchange rates would not have had a material impact upon our results of operations.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), conducted an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n27\n(b) Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(d), our management, including the CEO and CFO, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined by Rule 13a-15(f), to determine whether any changes occurred during the\nquarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that there has been no such change\nduring the quarter covered by this report.\n28\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time-to-time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. In the opinion of our management, we are not presently a party to any material pending or threatened legal\nproceedings.\nItem 1A.

Assuming the three nominees are elected, following the Annual Meeting, the Board will continue to consist of ten\ndirectors.\nThe Board has determined that each director except Mr. Shepherd, our President and CEO, is an “independent director” as defined in the applicable rules of The Nasdaq\nStock Market, Inc. (“Nasdaq”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). We believe that having a Board consisting of\npredominantly independent, experienced directors with independent oversight by a non-executive Chair (as described below) is in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders.\nIt is critical that we recruit and nominate independent directors who help achieve the goal of a well-rounded, diverse Board that functions respectfully as a unit.\nOur Board includes directors who have historical institutional knowledge of the Company and the markets we serve, complemented by directors who bring\ndiversity of experience, perspectives, qualifications, and leadership to address the issues facing the Company. Our Board has made a concerted effort to recruit\nnew directors to achieve the right blend between experience and continuity and new perspectives, including with respect to gender, racial, and ethnic diversity.\nThe following charts represent director independence, tenure, and diversity, assuming the three nominees are elected at the Annual Meeting.\nBoard Diversity Matrix as of April 1, 2024\nTotal Number of Directors 10\nFemale Male Non-Binary Did Not Disclose Gender\nPart I: Gender Identity\nDirectors 3 7 — —\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black — 1 — —\nAlaskan Native or Native American — — — —\nAsian 2 1 — —\nHispanic or Latinx — — — —\nMiddle Eastern — 1 — —\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander — — — —\nWhite 1 4 — —\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities — — — —\nLGBTQ+ 1 — — —\nDid not disclose demographic background — — — —\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 7\nBack to Contents\nCompany Overview and Business Strategy\nCSG is a leader in innovative customer engagement, revenue management, and payments solutions that make ordinary customer experiences extraordinary.

We continue to monitor best\npractices and legal and regulatory developments with a view to refining our governance policies and procedures, as appropriate. The Board encourages you to\nvisit the governance page on our website at http://ir.csgi.com/documents.cfm, which provides information about our corporate governance practices and includes\nthe following documents:\n■ Board Committee Charters\n■ Code of Ethics and Business Conduct\n■ Corporate Governance Guidelines\n■ Stock Ownership Policy\nWe will disclose on our website any amendments to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct or any waiver of a provision of our Code of Ethics and Business\nConduct that is required to be disclosed under applicable SEC rules.\nInformation contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of, or incorporated by reference in, this proxy statement.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board does not have a policy regarding separation of the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board and believes it is in the best interests of the Company to\ndetermine the appropriate leadership structure based on current circumstances.\nMr. Cooper has served as Chair of the Board since 2022, and prior to his appointment as Chair, he served as the Vice-Chair of the Board. The Board has\ndetermined that an independent director serving as Chair is in our best interests at this time. Our Board believes that an independent director serving as Chair\nensures that the independent directors have a significant role in the active oversight of our business, including overseeing risk management, setting agendas,\nand establishing Board priorities and procedures. In the future, if the Board believes it would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, the\nBoard may decide that one person should serve as both CEO and Chair of the Board.\nRisk and Compliance Oversight\nOverall Risk Approach\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of our risks, including establishing our risk appetite and overseeing our risk management framework. The Board\nrecognizes that effective risk oversight is important to the success of our strategy and is an integral part of its fiduciary duties to the Company and our\nshareholders. The Board believes taking well-considered risk is a critical component of innovation and effective leadership, but also recognizes that imprudently\naccepting risk or failing to appropriately identify and mitigate risk could negatively impact our business and shareholder value. The Board therefore seeks to\nfoster a risk-aware culture that conforms to an established risk appetite framework while encouraging thoughtful risk-taking in pursuit of the Company’s strategic\ninitiatives.\nThe Board exercises its risk oversight primarily through executive management, the Audit Committee, and the Cybersecurity Committee, as described below.\nThe Board believes our current leadership structure facilitates its oversight of risk by combining independent leadership through the Board and the Audit\nCommittee, with an experienced executive management team who each have intimate knowledge of our business, industry, and challenges.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 10\nBack to Contents\nBoard Committee Risk Oversight\nThe Audit Committee receives regular reports on risk-related matters from members of executive management, including:\n■ The Chief Compliance Officer, who reports functionally to the Chief Legal Officer and administratively to the Audit Committee, prepares reports summarizing\ncompliance risks, issues, and activities.\n■ The Head of Internal Audit, who reports functionally to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Accounting Officer, prepares reports summarizing\nthe results of internal audits and the related risks, issues, and activities.\n■ The Head of Risk, who reports to the Chief Accounting Officer, prepares reports summarizing our enterprise risk program and related risks, issues, and\nactivities.\nOur Compensation Committee and SSG Committee monitor risks in their respective areas of responsibility and keep the Board informed of any specific risks\nthrough regular reports. In addition, the Board has recently formed a Cybersecurity Committee to oversee cybersecurity risks. For additional information on our\ncybersecurity risk oversight, please see Item 1C of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nRisk Assessment and Mitigation Program\nWe maintain a formal risk assessment and risk mitigation program. Our executive officers, in conjunction with members of our risk and security organizations,\nreview this program periodically throughout the year. This program has three goals: (i) identify those risks that are most likely to affect our business; (ii) assign\nindividual executives to be responsible for monitoring and mitigating each of those risks; and (iii) provide a formal mechanism for the assigned executives to\nreport back periodically on the adequacy and effect of mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee and the Board regularly review the results of this program.\nInformation Security Governance Program\nThe following chart outlines our information security governance program structure and controls. For additional information on our information security\ngovernance program and cybersecurity risk oversight, please see Item 1C of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 11\nBack to Contents\nRisk Management Structure and Responsibilities\nThe following chart outlines our risk management structure and responsibilities:\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\nOversees Major Risks\n■ Strategic and Competitive ■ Legal and Compliance ■ Cybersecurity\n■ Financial ■ Operational ■ Brand and Reputational\nAudit Committee Compensation Committee SSG Committee Cybersecurity Committee\nPrimary Risk Oversight Primary Risk Oversight Primary Risk Oversight Primary Risk Oversight\n■ Financial statement integrity ■ Compensation and ■ Governance structure and ■ Data responsibility\nand reporting performance evalutions of processes objectives, strategies,\nexecutive officers capabilities, and initiatives\n■ Major financial and other ■ Board performance\nbusiness risk exposures ■ Incentive compensation ■ Risk assessment\n■ Shareholder concerns\nprograms\n■ Technology and privacy and (including sustainability) ■ Mitigation protocols\ndata protection ■ Succession planning for\n■ Independent director\nexecutive officers other than\n■ Risk management compensation policies and\nCEO\nframework practices\n■ Legal and compliance ■ Succession planning for CEO\n■ Internal controls ■ Environmental, Social and\nGovernance\nAnnual Board Evaluation Process\nThe Board is committed to a rigorous annual self-evaluation. The Chair of the SSG Committee coordinates an annual evaluation process that alternates between\na self-evaluation survey and an evaluation conducted by an independent, third-party consultant. In 2023, the Chair of the SSG Committee led the self-evaluation\nprocess. The results of the annual evaluation were provided to the full Board for their consideration. Regular Board evaluations will continue to include a Board\nsurvey process.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 12\nBack to Contents\nBoard Refreshment Policies\nThe Board does not have a mandatory retirement age or term limits because we believe such fixed rules do not recognize the continuing contributions of\ndirectors who have developed experience with, and insight into, the Company. However, the Board understands there is value in regularly reviewing and, if\nappropriate, refreshing its composition and, as described herein, continually evaluating the effectiveness of its directors.\nWhat We Look for in Director Nominees\nIn recommending nominees for election as directors, the SSG Committee reviews the present composition of the Board to determine if additional qualities, skills,\nand expertise would help the Board and its committees properly discharge their responsibilities. When there is a need, the SSG Committee utilizes the services\nof executive search firms with well-established board practices to help identify and recruit qualified director nominees. When identifying and assessing a\ncandidate’s qualifications, the SSG Committee considers, among other things:\n■ the candidate’s independence, judgment, skills, background, and experience;\n■ the candidate’s ability and willingness to devote the required amount of time to serve as a Board member and as a member of one or more Board committees;\n■ the candidate’s other business and professional commitments and potential conflicts of interest; and\n■ the number and type of other boards on which the candidate serves.\nAlthough we do not currently have a written policy on diversity, the SSG Committee values and seeks diversity when recruiting and nominating directors as we\nbelieve diverse companies consistently perform better and generate superior shareholder returns. We define “diversity” in the broadest sense and believe it\nencompasses many attributes, including background, experience, skills, substantive expertise, gender, ethnicity, geography, and education. Our Board is\nparticularly interested in assembling a group of directors who understand the needs of our customers and also have experience in operations, finance,\naccounting, marketing, human resources, sales, and domestic and international business—particularly in the technology and communications service provider\nand related industries. We also consider whether nominees are active or retired executive officers of public or private companies and whether they have ever\nserved on the board of a public company.\nWe expect Board members to display the personal attributes necessary to be effective directors: integrity, sound judgment, independence, and ability to operate\ncollaboratively. We believe the current members of our Board have a diverse set of business and personal experience, backgrounds, and expertise, and that\nthey all share the personal attributes described above. For more information regarding the skills and experience of our directors, please see the directors’\nbiographies, which begin on page 26.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 13\nBack to Contents\nShareholder Recommendations\nThe SSG Committee will consider director recommendations by our shareholders in the same manner that the committee considers other director candidates. A\nshareholder who wishes to make a recommendation should submit the recommendation in writing to the Secretary of the Company indicating the proposed\nnominee’s qualifications and other relevant biographical information and providing written confirmation that the proposed nominee consents to serve as a\ndirector if nominated and elected. Our Secretary will forward qualifying recommendations from shareholders to the Chair of the SSG Committee for further review\nand consideration. For shareholders who wish to nominate a director at a meeting, our bylaws provide that shareholder nominations for election to the Board are\nsubject to certain advance notice and informational requirements. See Shareholder Proposals for additional requirements and information. Shareholders may\nobtain a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions from our Secretary at CSG Systems International, Inc., 169 Inverness Drive West, Suite 300, Englewood,\nColorado 80112.\nBoard Committees\nThe charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the SSG Committee are available on our website at http://ir.csgi.com/documents.cfm.\nThe charter of the recently created Cybersecurity Committee will be included on our website when available.

All members of the Audit Committee satisfy all Nasdaq and SEC requirements applicable to audit committee members, and\nall members of the Audit Committee are “independent” as defined by the SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations. The Board has determined that Mr. Barnes, Mr.\nCooper, Mr. Tavares, and Ms. Yang are “audit committee financial experts” as defined by applicable SEC rules.\nCompensation Committee\nNumber of Meetings in 2023: 5\nThe Compensation Committee’s primary purposes are to review and recommend management compensation and benefit policies, and evaluate the performance\nof and recommend the compensation of our executive officers. In addition, the Compensation Committee has independent authority to administer and grant\nequity awards under our equity plans and annual performance bonuses for executive officers, other than the CEO. The Compensation Committee is also\nresponsible for ongoing oversight and evaluation of our compensation policies and practices for employees generally as they relate to risk management. The\nCompensation Committee may delegate any of its responsibilities to a subcommittee or the Chair of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation\nCommittee may also delegate to one or more of our officers the authority to grant awards to non-executive officers and employees under our equity\ncompensation plans. Since 2022, the Compensation Committee has delegated to the CEO the authority to grant equity awards to non-executive officers and\nother employees.\nAll members of the Compensation Committee satisfy all Nasdaq and SEC requirements applicable to compensation committee members, and all members of\nthe Compensation Committee are “independent” as defined by the SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations.\nDetermining Executive Officer Compensation and Use of Independent Executive Compensation Consultants\nTo assist the Compensation Committee with its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee retains an independent executive compensation consultant,\nconsults with our CEO (other than with respect to compensation decisions for the CEO) and our Chief Experience Officer, and draws upon the extensive\nbusiness experience of its members. The Compensation Committee directs the independent executive compensation consultant to prepare a comprehensive\nformal assessment of the competitiveness of our executive officer compensation program, including a comparison of the principal components of our program\n(base salaries, performance bonuses, and equity awards) and other compensation program elements with those of a peer group of other public companies as\nwell as industry practices. The Compensation Committee considers this assessment and other data provided by the independent executive compensation\nconsultant in arriving at its decisions or recommendations to the Board with respect to base salaries, performance bonuses, long-term incentives, and other\ncompensation program elements for our executive officers. For additional information about our executive compensation program, processes, and procedures,\nsee Compensation Discussion and Analysis.\nThe Compensation Committee periodically evaluates the qualifications of its independent executive compensation consultant. During 2023, Semler Brossy, a\nnational compensation consulting firm, provided executive compensation guidance to the Compensation Committee. Semler Brossy reported directly to the\nCompensation Committee Chair, and also coordinated with management for data collection and other work streams as directed by the Committee. Semler\nBrossy did not provide any other services to us in 2023.\nDuring 2023, the Compensation Committee requested information from Semler Brossy, our executives, and our Board members in order to assess the\nindependence of both of the Compensation Committee’s executive compensation consultant and to determine whether their work raised any conflict of interest.\nBased on the information provided, the Compensation Committee determined that Semler Brossy was independent and that its work did not raise conflicts of\ninterest.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 15\nBack to Contents\nRisks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices for All Employees\nThe Compensation Committee does not believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on the Company. A number of the factors considered by the Compensation Committee when it develops executive compensation recommendations have\nthe effect of mitigating risk. Additionally, executive officers and senior management regularly review our employee compensation policies and practices, including\nthe elements of our compensation programs, to determine whether any element or program design encourages excessive risk-taking.\nFor more information about the factors we consider that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking, see Risk and Compliance Oversight and Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNo member of the Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of CSG, and no executive officer of CSG has served on the compensation\ncommittee (or its equivalent) or board of any company that employed any member of our Compensation Committee or Board during fiscal year 2023.\nSustainability, Social Responsibility, and Governance Committee\nNumber of Meetings in 2023: 5\nThe SSG Committee’s primary purposes are to identify individuals qualified to become Board members, recommend to the Board nominees for election as\ndirectors, recommend directors for appointment to Board committees, evaluate the Board’s performance in conjunction with the formal and structured annual\nBoard evaluation process, review and recommend the compensation of our directors, including awarding of equity to our non-employee directors, review CEO\nsuccession planning, oversee and support company commitments to environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) and other public policy initiatives as they\npertain to business objectives and long-term strategy, and develop and recommend for Board approval our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of\nEthics and Business Conduct.\nAll members of the SSG Committee are “independent” as defined by the SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations.\nCybersecurity Committee\nEstablished in February 2024\nThe Cybersecurity Committee’s primary purpose is to provide oversight, guidance, and recommendations to the Board on cybersecurity matters, including data\nresponsibility objectives, strategies, capabilities, initiatives, and risk assessment and mitigation protocols for the Company. The members of this Committee have\nspecific cybersecurity experience. Prior to February 2024, the Board managed cybersecurity matters through the Audit Committee and a Cybersecurity\nSubcommittee.\nAll members of the Cybersecurity Committee are “independent” as defined by the SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 16\nBack to Contents\nDirector Attendance at Meetings\nDuring 2023, the Board held 8 meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the\ncommittees on which they served. In addition, during 2023, the Board held 4 executive sessions during which only independent directors were present. The\nBoard expects to continue to conduct executive sessions limited to non-employee directors only, at least twice a year. Our non-employee directors may schedule\nadditional executive sessions at their discretion.\nHistorically, most shareholders vote by proxy. Accordingly, directors are not required to attend our annual meetings. We expect, but do not require, employee\ndirectors to attend if their schedules permit, and non-employee directors are welcome to attend if they wish. All of our nominated directors and continuing\ndirectors attended our 2023 Annual Meeting. The Board scheduled the Annual Meeting to coincide with a regular quarterly meeting of the Board so that all\nmembers could more easily attend the Annual Meeting.\nCommunications with the Board\nWe invite shareholders or any other interested party to send written communications to the Board or to individual Board members. Please send your letter in\ncare of the Secretary of the Company at the address of our principal offices as shown on the first page of this proxy statement or via email to our Investor\nRelations Department at john.rea@csgi.com.

To date, we have seen higher-than-average promotion rates and lower turnover within this group.\n■ Continued to grow critical partnerships, such as Blacks in Technology (BIT) and for the second year in a row, hosted a session at their annual technology\nconference BITCON.\n■ Launched the Girls in Tech Scholarship in Indonesia, providing support for twelve young women passionate about technology to participate in a 3-month\nBootcamp focused on Full Stack Development and QA Automation, followed by a 3-month internship at CSG.\n■ Upskilled the global recruiting team through Inclusive Hiring Masterclass sessions, which assessed the recruitment lifecycle through an inclusive lens and\ndeveloped an Inclusive Hiring Playbook available to all hiring managers.\n■ Hosted “Fostering a Disability-Inclusive Workplace” an interactive session in partnership with GiftAbled and our Disabilities EBG for 50+ hiring managers in\nIndia to increase accessibility and disability inclusion from hiring to development.\n■ Reinforced equitable pay practices through audits, manager and employee education on fair pay practices including unconscious bias in pay decisions,\ntransparency in our compensation philosophy and awards, and intentional design of our hiring, promotion, and compensation decisions.\nWhile we are proud of our progress, we know there will always be room to continuously improve on these critically important areas that will lead to a stronger,\nhealthier, and faster-growing CSG.\nDelivering a Flexible First Approach to Work\nOur flexible first approach is a key differentiator that allows us to attract and retain top talent in the competitive global marketplace. It allows our employees to\nwork from anywhere, anytime, and any way they want. As a global company, flexible first is not only a benefit, but more important, a mindset that fosters trust,\nautonomy, and collaboration across teams and geographies in which we operate.\nTo support our flexible first culture, we provide:\n■ Employees with more choice and empowerment over their work arrangements, whether they prefer to work remotely, in the office, or in a hybrid model\n■ A suite of tools and resources to help employees optimize their productivity, well-being, and engagement in a flexible work environment, such as online\nlearning courses through our Degreed learning platform, wellness programs, and virtual events\n■ A global network of coworking spaces that employees can access when they and/or their teams need to collaborate and innovate together in person\nEven with our flexible first approach, we encourage relevant teams to work onsite to collaborate and co-create with our customers and their teams to strengthen\nand deepen our relationships – ensuring we deliver even greater value to our global customers.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 20\nBack to Contents\nFostering a Culture of Learning and Growth\nWe believe that learning and growth are essential for our employees to achieve their full potential and contribute to our business success. That is why we offer a\nvariety of learning opportunities, both formal and informal, to help our employees develop new skills, expand their knowledge, and advance their careers.\nSome of the learning opportunities we provide include:\n■ Leadership programs personalized by role, including frontline managers, emerging leaders, and directors and above\n■ Talent assessment and calibration process for all managers and above, identifying strengths and areas for improvement, and creating personalized\ndevelopment plans\n■ Succession planning for the executive and senior leadership teams and their direct reports, as well as critical talent, to prepare them for future roles and\nensure continuity of leadership\n■ A new Emerging Leaders Program to recognize and reward high-potential talent with equity awards, coaching, and participation in relevant learning programs\n■ An internal talent marketplace that enables employee career growth by making career opportunities visible and promoting personalized, relevant roles\n■ An enhanced onboarding and orientation programs to connect new hires to our community and culture, reducing our voluntary turnover by half, especially\namong employees with less than one year of tenure\n■ Online courses, webinars, podcasts, and other resources, to support self-directed learning on various topics and domains through our Degreed platform\nWe also know that a continued focus on career mobility, learning opportunities, and employee engagement are key drivers of our employee experience and, in\nturn, our business success. Along with formal learning programs, we encourage our employees to take ownership of their learning and growth. Seeking feedback\nand guidance from their managers and peers is part of this process.\nRecognizing and Rewarding Our Employees\nOur total rewards package combines market-competitive pay and benefits for all our employees. This includes our base pay, short- and long-term incentives, and\ncompetitive health and welfare benefits, including paid parental leave, two paid days of volunteer time, paid time off, paid holiday time, and retirement benefits.\nThrough our intentional performance management assessment and leadership development programs, we’ve improved manager feedback and coaching scores,\nas well as differentiating and rewarding employees based on both performance and behavior.\nWe make significant annual grants of discretionary equity awards (long-term incentives) in the form of restricted stock or restricted stock units to employees and\nour executive leadership. This aligns our employees and leaders with shareholders as we all strive to create greater shareholder value, while also enabling\nCSGers to share in our company’s success and the value we create together.\nEmployee recognition is a foundational aspect of everyday life at CSG, helping us bring our teams together to celebrate big wins and everyday moments. Over\nthe years, CSG has created an environment that encourages moments of thanks through formal and informal programs.\nOur formal recognition program provides opportunities for employees to recognize their peers and teams as well as nominate the best of the best for our\nquarterly and annual awards. With over 4,500 recognitions given in 2023, our program rewards those who bring our purpose to life — making employee and/or\ncustomer experiences extraordinary. While the formal recognition program is companywide, we also encourage our regional and functional leaders to create\nprograms that are meaningful to their teams.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 21\nBack to Contents\nSupporting Employee Well-Being\nWe believe that prioritizing employee well-being is not only a responsibility but also a business imperative. When our employees are healthy and happy, they are\nmore productive, creative, and engaged. They also deliver better outcomes for our customers and shareholders. That’s why we offer a range of programs and\ninitiatives that support our employees in achieving a healthy integration and balance of work and life.\nWe provide regular well-being sessions, led by experts, designed to empower our employees with knowledge and practical ways to support and promote their\nwell-being. We offer global employee sessions during World Mental Health Day and Mental Health Awareness Month. While we have placed a big emphasis on\nmental health, we also focus on physical well-being sessions and on community well-being.\nCSG recognizes the profound impact that mental health has on the well-being and productivity of our employees. Through an open dialogue, accessible\nresources, and a culture of empathy, we are dedicated to ensuring our employees have the resources they need. Some of the mental health resources we offer\ninclude:\n■ A global Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides free, confidential, and professional mental health resources, substance abuse support, and\nassistance for financial challenges and stress management. The EAP is available 24/7, 365 days a year, for our employees and their eligible dependents.\n■ Expanded access to and affordability of mental health care services through our medical plan coverage. CSG health plans cover out-of-network mental health\noffice visits at the in-network level to increase provider access. Virtual mental health care visits are covered at no cost to employees.\n■ Our Mental Health Employee Belonging Group provides resources, education, support, and a community to its members.\nThe data also tells us that volunteering boosts overall mental health. In 2023, we incorporated volunteer opportunities throughout the year such as:\n■ Mental Health Awareness Month: Employees volunteered with other colleagues in their community\n■ Earth Day: Partnership with EarthDay.ORG to provide employees with volunteer opportunities as part of the Great Global Cleanup\n■ World Mental Health Day: Employees were encouraged to volunteer and share their story\nIn addition, we offer competitive and market-aligned benefits in each country where we have employees. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision\ncoverage, as well as preventive care, family benefits, parental leave, and mental health coverage. We also provide access to telehealth services.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 22\nBack to Contents\nEmpowering Our Employee Belonging Groups\nAn important and highly visible way that we foster a culture of inclusion and belonging at CSG is through our EBGs. These are voluntary, employee-led groups\nthat share a common identity, interest, or cause. They provide opportunities for personal and professional development, networking, mentoring, community\ninvolvement, and advocacy. But most importantly, these groups shape the actions we take as a company.\nCSG’s EBGs have grown from six to eight total groups in 2023 with the addition of Caregivers and Mental Health EBGs launched later in the year. Our EBGs\nfocused on growing their global membership with groups like Women Engaged in Leadership Exploration and Development (WE LEaD) and the Black Culture\nCollective starting regional chapters to address the unique culture, nuance, and opportunities for connection in countries around the world. Highlights from 2023\ninclude:\n■ WE LEaD, CSG’s longest-standing EBG, now includes five chapters reflecting all global regions. This year, WE LEaD hosted their first Global Women’s\nSymposium from India where WE LEaD members had the opportunity to hear from female executive leaders and CSG Board members about their leadership\njourneys.\n■ PRIDE@CSG members hosted global conversations attended by hundreds of CSGers in June in honor of Pride month including, “Illuminating the LGBTQIA+\nPath in India” and “Life Through Trans Eyes” expanding the conversations around gender identity, LGBTQIA+ inclusion, and allyship.\n■ Disabilities EBG leaders collaborated with the Talent Acquisition team to develop a disability inclusion and accessibility workshop for leaders in India and\npartnered to simplify the accommodations process for both candidates and employees. In December, Brian Shepherd, our CEO, joined Disability:IN’s network\nof CEOs committed to fostering disability inclusion and benchmarking their efforts with the Disability Equality Index.\n■ The Mental Health EBG has sponsored 20+ members across five countries to become certified Mental Health First Aiders to help promote and support mental\nhealth and wellness education. This initial group of participants will provide training to others, as the EBG aspires to expand their network of First Aiders\nacross all regions.\nWe encourage all CSGers to join or start an EBG that resonates with them. By participating in EBGs, employees can enhance their sense of belonging, expand\ntheir network, develop new skills, and contribute to CSG’s success. Our EBGs are open to all employees, regardless of their background, role, or location.\nNearly 20% of CSG’s employees are members of one or more EBGs.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 23\nBack to Contents\nESG Practice\nCSG believes that diverse companies perform better and that operating responsibly and sustainably is in the best interest of our shareholders, customers,\nemployees, and their surrounding communities. The Company is committed to strong corporate governance policies and management of ESG practices that\nfocus on employees and culture, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. Assessing and managing climate, social, and governance-related risks\nand opportunities is led by CSG’s Executive Director of Global Sustainability & ESG Reporting. Management of diversity, equity, and inclusion risks and\nopportunities is led by the Executive Director of Global Inclusion and Impact.\nThese matters are overseen by CSG’s ESG Executive Oversight Group, which is comprised of leaders and subject matter experts from key functional areas\nacross the company. Among other ESG matters, this team oversees business operations and continuity plans with respect to significant business risks that may\noccur because of climate-related weather events.\nWe recently published our second annual Global Impact Report to highlight CSG’s commitment to a purpose-driven culture. In 2023, CSG received our second\nconsecutive “Prime” ESG rating from Institutional Shareholder Services (“ISS”), maintained our AA rating with MSCI and significantly improved our rating with\nSustainalytics and are now in the top 10% of our peer group from an ESG rating perspective. Further, we released our second annual Sustainability Accounting\nStandards Board (“SASB”) report in 2023 and issued our second annual Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) report in early 2024.\nInformation contained on, or accessible through, these links is not part of, or incorporated by reference in, this proxy statement.\nEnvironmental\nCSG recognizes that it has a responsibility to the environment beyond legal and regulatory requirements. We are committed to reducing our environmental\nimpact as part of our ongoing business strategy and operating methods, and working towards establishing specific goals that align with the Greenhouse Gas\n(“GHG”) Protocol and are consistent with the Science Based Targets initiative. The Science Based Targets initiative drives ambitious climate action in the private\nsector by enabling organizations to set science-based emissions reduction targets. In 2023, we made a public pledge to be carbon neutral in Scope 1 and Scope\n2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035.\nWe are also continuing to reduce the consumption of water, electricity, and gas through improved processes and upgrades. We strive to reduce the quantity of\nnon-hazardous materials sent to landfills by increasing reuse and recycling opportunities. We are committed to complying with and achieving all relevant\ndomestic and international regulatory requirements, continually improving, and monitoring environmental performance, incorporating environmental factors into\nbusiness decisions, and increasing employee awareness and training.\nWith employees in over 20 countries and serving customers in approximately 115 countries, environmental stewardship is a vitally important focus area. We\nseek to work with partners that are committed to reducing and recycling waste, investing in renewable energy, and responsible sourcing to create a more\nsustainable future. Reducing global emissions is critical, and in 2023 we made a public pledge to be carbon neutral in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas\nemissions by 2035. We have already begun tracking our carbon footprint and we have established a baseline to drive improvement in our environmental\nperformance as part of our ongoing business strategy and operating methods.\nSocial Responsibility\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”)\nAt CSG, we envision a culture of connectedness, where people are celebrated for who they are, rewarded for their unique contributions, and are empowered to\nmake positive differences in their communities. We know intentional inclusion across dimensions of diversity, including but not limited to, disability, sex, gender\nidentity, age, race, ethnicity, veteran status, and nationality, contributes to better business results.\nIn 2023, we launched “Workplace DEI in Action” our first mandatory training module for all employees to recognize core terminology and develop practices for\nbuilding and sustaining an inclusive culture. We also launched a new mentorship program called Engage to identify, accelerate, and retain high-potential diverse\ntalent with direct mentoring from senior leaders. CSG continues to nurture EBGs, including the launch of two new groups, Mental Health and Caregivers, along\nwith a handful of groups expanding to encompass global chapters. The Global DEI Council also expanded to include a regional council in India furthering CSG’s\nefforts to foster an inclusive environment across the globe.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 24\nBack to Contents\nLeadership Accountability\nThe leadership team has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to making sustainable progress to create a globally diverse, equitable, and inclusive CSG.\nThis commitment starts with the Board and their investment in social responsibility, and our CEO, who has been a champion for all CSGers (current and future)\nto experience a culture where everyone belongs and has an equal opportunity to advance. Our leaders are committed to learning, creating action plans to\nimprove metrics, and using data to measure progress.\nWe continue to invest time and resources in building more robust data and reporting infrastructure to ensure we can measure progress, identify areas to\nimprove, and allow greater visibility into the employee experience, including diversity and inclusion metrics. The senior leadership team now receives quarterly\nupdates on a variety of metrics including representation, inclusion survey scores, DEI progress, and employee feedback.\nSocial Impact\nWe are committed to making a bigger community impact by creating new opportunities and access for underrepresented groups, protecting the environment,\nand developing technology solutions that foster digital inclusivity. Our commitment starts with our employees actively engaging with their local communities. CSG\nstrives to align most of our social responsibility and impact activity with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\nOur social impact efforts focus on these key areas:\nCommunity Impact\nWe support Community Based Organizations (“CBOs”) that provide communities with the opportunity to participate, thrive, and make a lasting impact across the\nglobe. We continue to expand our partnerships with CBOs like We Make Change and the Women’s Foundation of Colorado and establish new ones with\nEarthday.org, Blacks In Tech, and Society of Women Engineers. In addition, we continue our commitment to CSG’s Global Day of Action, where we encourage\nevery employee to spend a day of service in their community. CSG Employees are given two full days of Volunteer Time Off per year, which can be used at any\ntime, for any cause. In 2023, CSG employees volunteered with numerous non-profit organizations and logged nearly 13,500 hours of volunteer service to help\nimprove communities across the globe.\nWe are proud to be a people-first organization. Our leaders and colleagues mobilized the Company to accelerate its community impact work across our global\nfootprint in 2023. With more than 6,000 employees across the globe we are building a future-ready world, through our employees, and in service of the planet.\nCSG is committed to practicing social responsibility via volunteerism, seeking to give back where we live and work, and helping bridge the digital divide in\nunderserved communities.\nEnabling Digital Inclusion\nWe strive to develop technological solutions that promote social progress and make navigating the digital world easier and more accessible. We also believe that\ndiverse experiences and perspectives help bring out the best ideas, drive innovation, and achieve transformative results to benefit the clients we serve. We are\ncommitted to digital inclusivity, doing the right thing for the users of our products, and taking action to improve the accessibility of our digital products and\nservices.\nGovernance\nOur ESG Workgroup is comprised of leaders from key areas across the Company with responsibility for business operations aligned to our ESG focus areas.

Those covered by the policy must attain the minimum ownership level within five years of April 1, 2022 (or their date of appointment, whichever is\nlater). Individuals may not sell any shares of CSG stock that they own, including any net shares received upon the exercise of options or vesting of restricted\nstock or restricted stock units until the ownership requirements are met, subject to a limited number of exceptions.\nThe Board and management believe that share ownership aligns the interests of the Company’s non-employee directors, CEO, and Executive Vice Presidents\nwith the interests of shareholders, promotes sound corporate governance, and demonstrates a commitment by leadership to the long-term future of the\nCompany. All non-employee directors, the CEO, and Executive Vice Presidents are in compliance with the ownership policy, subject to applicable grace periods\nand other transfer limitations.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 35\nBack to Contents\nBelow is a summary of the required minimum share ownership levels:\nRole Minimum Ownership Level(1) Compliance Status as of December 31, 2023\nNon-Employee Board Directors 5x annual cash retainer 100%\nCEO 6x base salary 100%\nExecutive Vice Presidents 3x base salary 100%\n(1) Stock value is determined by using a “20-day Trailing Average” ending on the applicable measurement date.

We reported profitable operating results and continued to execute\nupon our strategic initiatives. Key highlights include the following:\n■ Generated $1.169 billion in organic revenue and grew revenue by 7.3% year-over-year, representing our strongest annual organic revenue growth\nperformance in nearly 20 years\n■ Increased our profitability, as measured by our operating income margin percentage in 2023\n■ Significantly enhanced our non-GAAP free cash flow generation in 2023 as compared to 2022\n■ Expanded our leadership position in the North American PayTV and broadband market by continuing to deepen our relationships with these customers and\ndeploy new solutions\n■ Completed the migration of approximately 14 million Charter Communications subscribers to CSG’s platforms from a competitor’s product\n■ Strengthened our position as a top challenger brand in the wireless and telecommunications revenue management market with many sales wins, including for\none of the largest telecommunications service providers in the Caribbean and Latin America and for one of the largest wireless operators in Saudi Arabia\n■ Continued our industry diversification efforts by increasing revenue from verticals outside the CSP industry to approximately 28% of our revenue\n■ Drove innovation and technology leadership with $143 million of research and development investments to enable a growing list of companies around the\nworld to provide a more personalized customer experience and monetize new digital products and services\n■ Returned $152 million to shareholders through a combination of $35 million in quarterly dividend payments and $117 million in common stock repurchases\nunder a stock repurchase program. We also increased our 2023 dividend by 7% from the prior year, representing our 11th consecutive year of increasing our\ndividend payout\n2023 Executive Compensation Highlights\nOur executive compensation program consists of multiple elements, including cash base salary, cash annual performance bonus program, and performance-\nbased LTI awards that are earned over multiple years. The structure of our annual performance bonus program for NEOs includes two predetermined\nperformance measures that are objective and quantifiable, with a corresponding minimum and maximum payout range. A significant portion of our NEOs’ pay is\ntied to performance-based LTI awards based on the achievement of predetermined financial, operational, and market-based performance measures that we\nbelieve align the long-term interests of our executives with those of our shareholders.\nHighlights of our 2023 Executive Compensation Program include:\n■ Strong Say-on-Pay Support. Our 2023 Say-on-Pay proposal was approved by 94.9% of shareholders. Shareholder engagement is a key value and a\nsignificant factor in determining our compensation programs, and we are pleased with the positive response from shareholders to enhancements we have\nmade in recent years.\n■ DEI Modifier. CSG believes that a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) produces superior shareholder returns over time. To further focus\nexecutive action on CSG’s commitment to DEI, starting in 2022, the Company introduced a rigorous DEI compensation modifier that applied to its annual\nperformance bonus in 2023. The modifier could result in an up to +/-10% impact on bonus outcomes based on the Compensation Committee’s assessment of\nprogress on many factors including representation and improvement on belonging scores. The Board approved a 2.5% DEI Modifier for the 2023 annual\nperformance bonuses. This determination was primarily based on the fact that the Company made quantifiable and steady progress in increasing the number\nof qualified management employees from historically underrepresented groups, including women and people of color at the Executive Director and above\nlevel. In addition, we ensure that programs foster development and retention of traditionally underrepresented groups.\n■ Pay for Performance Alignment. Our financial performance resulted in a 2023 annual performance bonus achievement at 111.7% of target. Our NEOs\nearned an overall weighted achievement of 85.5% of target shares for our 2022 performance-based LTI award’s financial objectives. We view these outcomes\nas indicative of our rigorous goal-setting process.\n■ Strengthened Executive Leadership. Starting in September 2023, Mr. Tran assumed additional responsibilities as acting President of Global Telecom and\nMs. Bauer assumed additional responsibilities over CSG’s commercial operations. These changes bring experienced leadership with proven success to\nimportant areas for CSG to help us win big and innovate even faster.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 39\nBack to Contents\nCompensation Mix and Pay-for-Performance Compensation Program\nAs shown below, over half of the total target compensation for our NEOs was based on the achievement of key financial and operational measures under our\nannual performance bonus program and performance-based LTI awards.\nOur NEOs achieved payout of 2023 annual performance bonus and 2022 performance-based stock vesting under our executive compensation program as\nfollows:\n■ 114.2% of target under the annual performance bonus program for 2023; and\n■ 85.5% of target shares vest under the 2022 performance-based LTI program.\nThe direct compensation for our NEOs includes the components described below.\nElement(1) Variability Purpose Weighting FY2023 Terms/Outcomes\nAnnual Base Salary Fixed Provide assured, competitive base 10-28% Four of our NEOs received a salary increase in\ncompensation that reflects the scope of FY2023 based on improving alignment with\nresponsibility, level of authority, and market and in recognition of additional\noverall duties of the position responsibilities taken on in 2023\nAnnual Performance Performance- Provide an annual bonus opportunity 13-21% Based on revenue less transaction fees and\nBonus Program Based that is tied to predetermined Company non-GAAP adjusted operating margin, and\nperformance goals and achievement of subject to a DEI Modifier, in addition to\nindividual performance objectives to individual performance.

As such, we continue to solicit and consider feedback from our shareholders as part of our regular outreach efforts.\nKey Governance and Compensation Practices\nWe believe that the following governance and compensation practices reinforce our business strategy, culture, and values.\nWHAT WE DO WHAT WE DON’T DO\nNo repricing or replacing of underwater options without shareholder\nMajority of executive officer pay is long-term and performance-based\napproval\nMeaningful share ownership policy No income tax gross-ups in executive employment agreements\nClawback policy for executive officers No excessive perquisites or other benefits\nIndependent executive compensation consultant engaged by the No dividends or dividend equivalents paid on unvested time-based or\nindependent Compensation Committee performance-based shares\nFinancial and operational metrics for executive incentive awards\nNo “single-trigger” change in control vesting of equity awards\nsupport our long-term business strategy\nLimit post-employment and change in control benefits No hedging or pledging of the Company’s securities is permitted\nHold annual say-on-pay vote\nActively review, compare, and benchmark peer company\ncompensation practices\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 41\nBack to Contents\nHow the Compensation Committee Determines Executive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee evaluates and determines the base salary for each of our NEOs, other than the CEO, as well as the performance measures and\ntarget levels for the annual performance bonus program and performance-based LTI awards for the current year. The Compensation Committee evaluates and\nrecommends to the Board the base salary, performance measures, and target levels for the annual performance bonus program and performance-based LTI\nawards for the current year for the CEO.\nWhen making compensation decisions and recommendations, the Compensation Committee considers the following key factors:\n■ Competitive peer group and market information and guidance provided by the Compensation Committee’s independent executive compensation consultant\n■ Our financial and operational performance compared to the performance targets for our incentive plans\n■ Progress on key strategic initiatives\n■ Individual performance reviews and compensation recommendations provided by the CEO\n■ Compensation Committee and Board evaluations, both formal and informal, of the NEOs, including the CEO\nThe independent auditing firm KPMG independently reviewed and audited the following: (1) the level of performance attained for our predetermined performance\nmeasures; (2) the amount payable under the annual performance bonus program; and (3) the vesting levels for our performance-based LTI awards.\nRole of the Independent Executive Compensation Consultant and Management\nThe Compensation Committee has sole authority and discretion to retain and terminate executive compensation consultants, independent legal counsel, and\nother advisers to help the committee perform its responsibilities. It also has the sole authority to approve the fees, scope, and other terms of engagement with its\nexecutive compensation consultant and other advisers, with full funding provided by the Company. The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining\nthe independence of its executive compensation consultant and other advisers. Management is available on request to assist the consultant by providing\nhistorical pay data and perspective on our competitive environment for recruiting managerial talent.\nThe Compensation Committee has retained Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant. In 2023, Semler Brossy attended Compensation\nCommittee meetings, including executive sessions, and provided counsel on various compensation-related matters, including peer group selection, competitive\nmarket assessments, and insights into market trends in executive compensation. The Committee assessed the independence of Semler Brossy pursuant to SEC\nrules and concluded that their work did not raise any conflicts of interest.\nRole of Benchmarking in Determining Compensation and Peer Group\nHow We Use Peer Group Information\nTo assist the Compensation Committee in establishing 2023 compensation for the NEOs, our executive compensation consultant provided a competitive\nassessment using peer group compensation information for the primary elements of our NEO compensation packages. Along with our executive compensation\nconsultant, we analyzed and assessed peer group data for roles corresponding to and closely aligned with the roles of our NEOs.\nThe Compensation Committee recognizes that peer group comparisons may not be perfectly aligned because the responsibilities at peer group companies may\nnot be directly comparable to those of our NEOs with similar or equivalent titles. The Compensation Committee generally considers total direct compensation for\nan NEO to be competitive if it is near the median of the peer group data.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 42\nBack to Contents\nPeer Group Used for Benchmarking\nThe peer group used for compensation benchmarking is created based on analysis and recommendations by our independent executive compensation\nconsultant. The peer group is reviewed annually to ensure its composition and characteristics remain consistent with our objectives. As a result of the 2022\nreview for the 2023 compensation peer group, the Compensation Committee made changes to the peer group, removing 10 peers as a result of merger and\nacquisition activity or business fit and adding seven peers, selected based on a combination of business applicability, scale, and impact on peer group size.

Mr. Kennedy also maintained his target annual bonus\nachievement at 100% with 50% based on Company performance and 50% based on achievement of Revenue Management and Digital Monetization (RMDM)\nperformance objectives.\nKenneth Kennedy’s COO Revenue Management and Digital Monetization (RMDM) Performance\nMr. Kennedy’s RMDM performance is based on the following predetermined financial performance measures, excluding the financial impact of any mergers and\nacquisitions: (i) RMDM Recognized Revenue (25% weighting); (ii) RMDM Sales Bookings (20% weighting); (iii) RMDM Contribution Margin (17.5% weighting);\n(iv) RMDM Gross Margin (17.5% weighting). The remaining 20% weighting is assigned to various strategic business objectives. Based on actual performance\ndelivered in 2023 against these measures and the outcome of the weighted measure calculation, Mr. Kennedy received a prorated payout of 43.7%, exclusive of\nthe DEI Modifier. Mr. Kennedy’s bonus was prorated through September 10, 2023, which is the last date on which he served as the Chief Operating Officer and\nPresident — Revenue Management and Digital Monetization, before providing transition services to the Company through December 31, 2023.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 44\nBack to Contents\nCompany Performance Percentage\nThe Company performance percentage is based on our performance against two predetermined financial performance goals: revenue less transaction fees and\nnon-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage. If we achieve the target levels of performance for both measures, the Company performance percentage\nachieved will be 100%. We must achieve the minimum threshold performance for both measures for the Company performance percentage to exceed zero. If we\nexceed target levels, the Company performance percentage may reach a maximum of 200%. The following table shows our financial results with respect to the\n2023 targets:\n2023\nMinimum 2023 Target\nThreshold (100% Payout) 2023 Results\nRevenue less transaction fees (in millions)(1) $ 1,014.0 $ 1,074.0 $ 1,081.8\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage(2) 16.5% 16.8% 17.2%\n(1) Revenue less transaction fees is defined as GAAP revenue less transaction fees.\n(2) Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage is calculated by dividing Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue less transaction fees. Non-GAAP operating\nincome is defined as our GAAP operating income with the following items added back, as applicable: (a) stock-based compensation; (b) restructuring and reorganization\ncharges; (c) executive transition costs; and (d) acquisition-related expenses (e.g., amortization of acquired intangible assets, earn-out compensation, and transaction-related\ncosts).\nThe Company’s performance percentage achieved for 2023 based on the results in the above table was calculated at 111.7% and was certified by the\nCompensation Committee in February 2024. The predetermined targets were established by the Compensation Committee in January 2023. The amount is\ndetermined by linear extrapolation between the intersection of established weighted percentages based on revenue less transaction fees on the x-axis and non-\nGAAP adjusted operating margin percentage on the y-axis.\nDEI Modifier\nThe Board approved a 2.5% DEI Modifier for the 2023 annual performance bonuses. This determination was primarily based on the fact that the Company made\nquantifiable and steady progress in increasing the number of qualified management employees from historically underrepresented groups, including women and\npeople of color at the Executive Director and above level. In addition, we ensure that programs foster development and retention of traditionally\nunderrepresented groups.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 45\nBack to Contents\nNEO Individual Performance Percentage\nThe final component of the Annual Performance Bonus Program is an evaluation of each NEO’s individual performance achievement expressed as a\npercentage, not to exceed 100%. This evaluation is based on the achievement of certain common and unique objectives described below. These non-financial\nobjectives are important to our success and are designed to enhance shareholder value over the long term.\nCommon Objectives\nEach NEO has multiple objectives associated with the stewardship of his or her areas of responsibility. The specific objectives vary by NEO but typically include\nachieving both near and long-term business objectives and meeting budget expectations.\nUnique Objectives\nThe following are examples of categories of individual objectives based on area of responsibility:\n■ Deliver on key development initiatives. The Company has a technology product roadmap that requires significant software development investments aimed\nat achieving specified feature and functional milestones, and overall, at modernizing our platforms and processes to enhance our market competitiveness.\n■ Maintain and expand customer relationships. It is critical to ensure the relationships with our key customers remain strong and expand to ensure contract\nrenewals result in more profitable revenue growth.\n■ Contribute to growth initiatives. Implementation of our long-term strategic growth plan is a fundamental objective, including the successful completion and\nintegration of our merger, acquisition, and partnership strategies.\n■ Increase cost efficiency. Our NEOs are expected to identify and implement potential cost savings and process efficiencies in identified areas of the\nCompany.\n■ Employee development. Succession planning and development of key leaders and employees is an important organization-wide objective, including\ntransitioning identified tasks and functions to new leaders, where applicable.\nThe Compensation Committee met in February 2024 to consider the 2023 performance of each NEO as compared to his or her respective performance goals.\nMr. Shepherd summarized the 2023 performance of the other NEOs and presented information to the Compensation Committee for review. After evaluating each\nNEO’s performance, the Compensation Committee assigned each NEO an individual performance percentage of 100% for 2023.\nFinal Bonus Calculation\nThe following table provides each NEO’s earned 2023 annual performance bonus calculation:\nCompany NEO\nNEO Performance DEI Modifier Performance 2023 Total\nTarget Bonus Percentage Percentage Percentage Bonus\nNEO Base Salary xPercentage xAchieved +Achieved x Achieved = Earned\nBrian Shepherd $ 730,000 150% 111.7% 2.5% 100% $ 1,250,490\nHai Tran $ 500,000 75% 111.7% 2.5% 100% $ 428,250\nElizabeth Bauer $ 450,000 75% 111.7% 2.5% 100% $ 385,425\nRasmani Bhattacharya $ 425,000 75% 111.7% 2.5% 100% $ 364,013\nKenneth Kennedy $ 346,575 50% 111.7% 2.5% 100% $ 197,894\n50% 43.7% 2.5% 100% $ 80,102\n(1) Mr. Kennedy’s bonus is prorated through September 10, 2023, which is the last date on which he served as the Chief Operating Officer and President — Revenue Management\nand Digital Monetization, before providing transition services to the Company through December 31, 2023.

Each NEO is awarded an aggregate LTI value based on a review of market data and recommendations from our\nCompensation Committee’s independent executive compensation consultant, allocated between the two types of awards. For 2023, we used the same mix of\nawards that we used in 2022 to provide an appropriate balance of performance and time-based compensation to support our long-term strategy. We believe this\nmix motivates outstanding performance and encourages retention.\n2023 LTI AWARD MIX\nAward Type Allocation Percentage Alignment to Shareholder Interests\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Vesting depends on our performance over a three-year period against\nspecified predetermined performance measures\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Value realized for the award depends on our stock price when the\naward vests\nOur restricted stock award agreements provide for the accrual of cash dividends for unvested shares. Accrued dividends are only paid when (and to the extent\nthat) shares vest and are forfeited if the underlying shares are not earned.\nSee the Executive Compensation Tables – 2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards for additional information on the 2023 grants.\n2023 Performance-Based LTI Award\nThe 2023 performance-based awards are based on revenue, non-GAAP EPS, and TSR relative to the Russell 2000 Index. The portion measured against\nrevenue and non-GAAP EPS has an opportunity to vest at the end of a performance period ending December 31, 2024, and the portion based on relative TSR\nhas an opportunity to vest at the end of a performance period ending December 31, 2025.\nThe Compensation Committee selected these rigorous measures, their associated weightings, and performance period length to focus executives on financial\nmetrics key to our strategic objectives and on driving returns for our shareholders, and balance long-term goal setting with maintaining a strong line of sight\ntoward achievement - particularly on multi-year financial goals - in an uncertain economic environment.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 47\nBack to Contents\n2023 PERFORMANCE-BASED LTI AWARD\nTwo-Year Performance Period Ending December 31, 2024, and Three-Year Performance Period Ending December 31, 2025\nPerformance Measures Weighting Definition\nNon-GAAP EPS Calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by the weighted average of fully-\n(Two-Year) diluted shares outstanding for the period.

Our clawback policy authorizes us to reduce or cancel, or require the recovery of all or a portion of a\ncurrent or former executive officer’s annual bonus or LTI compensation award in the context of a material restatement of the financial statements of the Company\nin accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. In connection with our executive severance policy, the Company is also authorized to reduce or cancel, or require the\nrecovery of all or a portion of an NEO’s annual bonus or LTI compensation award in connection with such policy.\nAnti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy\nAs part of our stock trading policy, all employees, including our executive officers and non-employee directors (and their designees) are prohibited from engaging\nin short sales of our securities and engaging in transactions that are designed to hedge, pledge, or offset any decrease in the market value of our stock,\nincluding certain forms of hedging, pledging and monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars, prepaid variable forward sale contracts, equity swaps, and\nexchange funds.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 49\nBack to Contents\nOther Considerations\nOther Benefits and Employment Agreements\nThe Compensation Committee does not believe that perquisites and other benefits should play a major role in the overall compensation of our NEOs. We offer\nour NEOs substantially the same benefits as our other employees, including the opportunity to defer a portion of their annual base salary and annual\nperformance bonus through a 401(k) plan that is generally available to our U.S.-based population, and the plan includes Company matching contributions.\nIn 2021, the Board decided to freeze the restricted non-qualified deferred compensation program discussed in 2023 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation. The\nCompensation Committee viewed this deferral program as individual retirement planning options and not as long-term compensation. Due to the limited\nhistorical employee participation rate in the non-qualified deferred compensation program, the Board froze the plan effective January 1, 2022, and as such\nprohibited any future contributions to the program.\nOur NEOs participate in an Executive Severance Plan that provides benefits in the event of involuntary separation from service. See Severance and Change in\nControl Benefits for details.\nTax Deductibility of Executive Compensation\nSection162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder generally limit the amount of compensation we can deduct in any one\nfiscal year for compensation paid to our CEO, CFO, and certain other covered employees to $1 million. While the Compensation Committee considers the\ndeductibility of compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, it retains the flexibility to grant discretionary awards and make payments that\nit determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the amounts are not deductible by the Company for tax purposes.\nAccounting Considerations\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC Topic 718”), requires us to recognize an expense for the fair\nvalue of equity-based compensation awards over the expected service period. Grants of stock options, restricted stocks, and performance-restricted stocks\nunder our equity incentive award plans are accounted for under ASC Topic 718. We will consider the accounting implications of significant compensation\ndecisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. As accounting standards change, we may revise\ncertain programs to appropriately align the accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we reference\nnon-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage, non-GAAP Earnings per Share (EPS), non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, and non-\nGAAP free cash flow. CSG believes that these non-GAAP financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial measures, provide investors\nwith greater transparency to the information used by CSG’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not measures of performance under GAAP, and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial information. Limitations with the use of non-GAAP financial measures include the following items: non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any\ncomprehensive set of accounting rules or principles; the way in which CSG calculates non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the way in which other\ncompanies calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures; non-GAAP financial measures do not include all items of income and expense that affect CSG’s\noperations and that are required by GAAP to be included in financial statements; certain adjustments to CSG’s non-GAAP financial measures result in the\nexclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in CSG’s financial statements in future periods; and certain charges excluded from CSG’s non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are cash expenses, and therefore do impact CSG’s cash position.\nPlease refer to CSG’s public SEC filings for disclosures related to non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 50\nBack to Contents\nReport of the Compensation Committee\nWe have reviewed and discussed with the management of the Company the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which appears in this proxy statement as is\nrequired by Item 402(b) of SEC Regulation S-K.\nBased upon such review and discussions, we recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.\nCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors(1)\nSilvio Tavares, Chair\nGregory Conley\nHaiyan Song\n(1) Frank Sica resigned from the Compensation Committee on May 17, 2023.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 51\nBack to Contents\nProposal 2 — Advisory Vote to Approve\nthe Compensation of Our Named\nExecutive Officers\nWe are asking our shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement.

This amount was determined by multiplying the number of shares of\nstock or units by the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq on the applicable vesting dates.\n2023 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation\nThe following table contains information about contributions, earnings, withdrawals, and account balances for our NEOs under the Company’s non-qualified\nWealth Accumulation Plan, which was last in effect during 2021. In 2021, due to the limited historical employee participation rate, the Board decided to freeze the\nPlan effective January 1, 2022, and prohibited any further contributions to the Wealth Accumulation Plan.\nThe Wealth Accumulation Plan was an elective, unfunded deferred compensation plan intended to build net worth through the deferral of cash compensation on\na before-tax basis. Participation in the Wealth Accumulation Plan was limited to Vice Presidents and above, including the NEOs. Each participant had to elect by\nDecember of the preceding year to defer: (1) up to 25% of the participant’s base salary; and/or (2) up to 100% of the participant’s cash bonus. All eligible\nemployees could elect to defer up to $700,000 in the aggregate for any one year. A matching contribution was made equal to 25% of the deferral, up to a\nmaximum of $6,250 per participant for any one plan year. The Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table below shows the aggregate amount each NEO\nelected to defer and the amount that the Company contributed to the Wealth Accumulation Plan.\nPayment could be made as a lump sum or in monthly installments for up to 180 months, depending on whether the participant elected to receive payment as an\nin-service distribution or upon termination of employment, and the payment options offered at the time of the participant’s deferral election. Generally, Wealth\nAccumulation Plan deferral account benefit payments will not begin earlier than the elected commencement date. If a participant dies, the participant’s deferred\ncompensation benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiaries or estate in a lump sum. Participants may request an early withdrawal in the event of an unforeseen\nemergency, which request is subject to approval. For all participants, distributions triggered by termination of employment are automatically delayed six months.\nThe Company has the right to terminate the Wealth Accumulation Plan and distribute all vested amounts credited to participant accounts upon a change in\ncontrol.\nThe participant may select from a wide mix of investment crediting funds that best suits their goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. The investment options available\nand their performance, as well as planning tools to assist the participant in selecting an appropriate mix, are available online with the record keeper. The participant\nmay change investment crediting elections or request investment exchanges between options whether online or through phone services with the record keeper.\nInvestment crediting options are used to measure the notional gains and losses that will be credited to the participant’s account over time. While no actual\ninvestment is made in the investment crediting options selected, the participant’s account is subject to the same market investment risk as the actual investment in\nsuch investment crediting options.\nParticipants were fully vested immediately in their own salary deferrals and vested 100% in Company matching contributions after three years of service. All\nNEOs who participated in the plan were fully vested in their Wealth Accumulation Plan account balances.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 58\nBack to Contents\nAggregate Aggregate Aggregate\nBalance at Executive Registrant Aggregate Withdrawals/ Balance at\nDecember 31, Contributions Contributions in Earnings in Distributions in December 31,\nName 2022 in 2023(1) 2023(2) 2023 2023 2023(3)\nBrian Shepherd $ 336,666 $ - $ - $ 46,094 $ - $ 382,760\nHai Tran $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nElizabeth Bauer $ 1,157,449 $ - $ - $ 294,898 $ - $ 1,452,347\nRasmani\nBhattacharya $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nKenneth Kennedy $ 1,400,244 $ - $ - $ 321,372 $ - $ 1,721,616\n(1) The Plan was frozen effective 2022; therefore, previously participating NEOs are no longer contributing to the Plan.

The Compensation Committee believes that maintaining a competitive\nlevel of separation benefits is appropriate as part of an overall compensation program designed to attract, retain, and motivate the highest-quality management\nteam. After a recent benchmarking and in support of these objectives, CSG introduced a new, market-aligned Executive Severance Plan effective April 1, 2022,\nwhich was amended on March 28, 2023.\nThe Executive Severance Plan streamlines and simplifies the benefits to be provided to our executives in the event of termination by CSG for any reason other\nthan cause, death, or disability, or by the executive for good reason, as such terms are defined under the Executive Severance Plan.\nEach of our executive officers elected to participate in the Executive Severance Plan with each of Mr. Shepherd, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Bauer entering into\nparticipation agreements that differ from the standard form participation agreement in order to reflect benefits previously contained in their respective 2021\nemployment agreements and other benefits as approved by the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors.\nIn the event of a termination without cause, or that does not occur within the first 18 months following a change in control of CSG, participants in the\nExecutive Severance Plan would receive, subject to any limitations under 280G, the following separation benefits:\n■ a severance payment consisting of an amount equal to 100% of the participant’s annual base salary and 100% of the target bonus, paid over a 12-month\nperiod; provided, however, that Mr. Shepherd’s payment is based on 200% for his base salary;\n■ a lump sum amount equal to the COBRA continuation coverage premiums that would be payable by the participant for the first 18 months of the COBRA\ncontinuation period;\n■ if the termination occurs on or after June 1 of the applicable calendar year, a lump sum payment consisting of the participant’s target bonus, pro-rated for the\nnumber of days the participant was employed during the calendar year and based on the actual performance of the company for the year in which the\nparticipant’s termination date occurs; and\n■ a pro-rated portion of the unvested time-based restricted stock award and a pro-rated portion of the unvested performance- and market-based restricted stock\nawards with the vesting amount of both based on the number of months employed during the vesting cycle and with the performance-based stock vesting based\non the actual performance achieved at the end of the performance period.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 59\nBack to Contents\nIn the event of a termination within the first 18 months following a change in control of CSG, participants in the Executive Severance Plan would\nreceive, subject to any limitations under 280G, the following separation benefits:\n■ a lump sum severance payment consisting of an amount equal to 200% of the participant’s annual base salary and target bonus, with the exception of Mr.\nShepherd, Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Bauer, who would receive an amount equal to 300% of their annual base salary and target bonus as reflected in their\nparticipation agreements;\n■ a cash amount equal to the COBRA continuation coverage premiums that would be payable by the participant for the first 18 months of the COBRA\ncontinuation period;\n■ an additional lump sum payment consisting of the participant’s target bonus, pro-rated for the number of days the participant was employed during the\ncalendar year; and\n■ vesting of all unvested time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards, with the vesting amount for the performance-based stock awards\ndetermined at target; provided, however, that for any market-based stock awards on a relative TSR metric, the performance period would be deemed to have\nended on the date of the change in control and will be valued on that date.\nPayments to participants under the Executive Severance Plan are contingent on, among other things, the participant entering into and complying with a\nbroad-based release of CSG.\nMr. Kennedy was Chief Operating Officer and President, Revenue Management and Digital Monetization, until September 10, 2023, before providing transition\nservices to the Company through December 31, 2023.

The severance\npayments paid to Mr. Kennedy included only those benefits in accordance with the Executive Severance Plan as modified by his participation agreement and\noutlined herein.

The amounts shown are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to each NEO assuming a\ntermination was effective as of December 31, 2023. We used $53.21 per share, the closing price of our common stock as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading\nday of our 2023 fiscal year), in determining the potential value of accelerated vesting of restricted stock awards. The actual amounts to be paid can only be\ndetermined at the time of an NEO’s separation from us.\nTermination for Death or Disability\nAssuming termination of employment on December 31, 2023, on account of the death of Mr. Shepherd or Ms. Bauer, or by reason of such NEO’s disability, Mr.\nShepherd or Ms. Bauer would receive accrued benefits, any other amounts or benefits earned, accrued, or owed but not paid as of the employment termination\ndate, and his or her pro-rated bonus at target performance for 2023 in accordance with the terms of his or her respective Executive Severance Plan participation\nagreements.\nIn addition, if our NEO’s employment is terminated by reason of disability, he or she would receive continued coverage under the group insurance benefits until\nthe first to occur of the cessation of such disability or the attainment of age 65.

Cause means that one or more of the following have occurred:\n(i) the participant’s willful and deliberate failure to substantially perform his executive and management duties hereunder to the detriment of the Company for\nreasons other than employee’s sickness, injury, or disability; (ii) the participant’s willful and deliberate misconduct, which is a material violation of the Company’s\nwritten policies and/or results in substantial injury or damage (whether reputational, financial, or otherwise) to the Company; (iii) the participant’s conviction of, or\nplea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony; (iv) the participant’s breach of any restrictive covenant agreement with the Company, including but not limited to,\nconfidentiality noncompete, nonsolicitation and/or nondisclosure covenants; and (v) the participant’s certification of materially inaccurate financial or other\ninformation pertaining to the Company with actual knowledge of such inaccuracies on the participant’s part. In no event will the results of operations of the\nCompany or exercise of the participant’s business judgment made in good faith constitute an independent basis for terminating the participant’s employment for\nCause.\nChange in Control\nFor purposes of the Executive Severance Plan, a “Change in Control” of the Company generally includes (i) the date any one person, or more than one person\nacting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group constitutes more than 50% of the total\nvoting power of the stock of the Company. However, if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more than 50% of the\ntotal fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not considered\ncausing a change in the ownership of the Company or to cause a change in the effective control of the Company; (ii) the date any one person, or more than one\nperson acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons)\nownership of stock of the Company possessing 50% or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; (iii) the date that any one person, or more\nthan one person acting as a group acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or\npersons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than 50% of the total gross fair market value of all the assets of the\nCompany immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions; or (iv) the date a majority of the members of the Board is replaced during any 12-month period by\ndirectors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the Board before the date of the appointment or election. The foregoing\nis a summary of the more detailed definition included in the Executive Severance Plan.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 63\nBack to Contents\nGood Reason\nFor the purposes of the Executive Severance Plan, “Good Reason” generally means if, without the participant’s consent, any of the following applies: (i) a\nmaterial diminution in the executive’s duties, responsibilities, or authority; or (ii) a material reduction in base salary (other than a reduction effected on behalf of\nthe Company as part of a general cost-saving strategy that affects similarly situated employees of the Company); or (iii) in the event that the separation from\nservice is initiated by the participant for Good Reason following a Change in Control, the assignment to the participant of duties significantly inconsistent with, or\ndifferent from, the participant’s duties and responsibilities existing at the time of the Change in Control.\nTo have “Good Reason,” the participant must give the Company notice of any event or condition that would constitute a basis for “Good Reason” within 90 days\nof the event or condition that would constitute a basis for “Good Reason;” and, upon the receipt of such notice, the Company will have 30 days to remedy such\nevent or condition. If such event or condition is not remedied within such 30-day period, any termination of employment by the participant for “Good Reason”\nmust occur within 30 days after the period for remedying such condition or event has expired.\nA participant may terminate his or her employment for Good Reason at any time after providing the Company thirty (30) days prior written notice setting forth in\nreasonable specificity the event(s) that constitute(s) Good Reason within 90 days of the condition first arising.

Because there has been a\nsubstantial change within our employee population, we recalculated the median employee for 2023. To identify the median employee in 2023 and to determine\nthe annual total compensation, as defined below, of our median employee and our CEO, we took the following steps:\n■ We selected December 31, 2023, as the date on which we would identify our median employee because it enabled us to make such identification in an\nefficient and reasonable manner;\n■ We identified our median employee, after accumulating annual base pay, bonus earned, and equity granted (“Annual Total Compensation”) for our entire\nglobal employee workforce, excluding our CEO, based on the local currency of the countries in which they were employed for the fiscal year that ended on\nDecember 31, 2023;\n■ Each employee’s Annual Total Compensation was then converted to U.S. Dollars using average foreign currency rates prevailing during the year, and arrayed\nhigh to low to identify our median employee; and\n■ We calculated Annual Total Compensation for the median employee in the same manner that we calculated compensation for our NEOs for our 2023\nSummary Compensation Table, resulting in Annual Total Compensation for our median employee to be $47,428 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur CEO’s Annual Total Compensation for 2023 was $7,996,250, as reported in the Executive Compensation Tables - 2023 Summary Compensation Table, and\nwas approximately 169 times the Annual Total Compensation of the median employee.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 65\nBack to Contents\n2023 Pay versus Performance\nPay versus Performance Table\nThe following table contains additional compensation information of our current and former CEO (“CEO”) and non-CEO named executive officers (“NEOs”),\nalong with total shareholder return (“TSR”), net income, and company-selected revenue measure results for our fiscal years ending in 2023, 2022, 2021, and\n2020.

The Company expects that representatives of KPMG LLP will attend the Annual Meeting. Such representatives will have the opportunity to\nmake a statement if they wish, and they will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts paid to KPMG in three categories.\n“Audit Fees” are the aggregate fees billed by KPMG LLP for 2023 and 2022 for professional services rendered for audits of our annual consolidated financial\nstatements and reviews of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/Form 10-K, as well as for services that are normally\nprovided by KPMG LLP in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for such periods, such as the attestation on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.\n“Audit-Related Fees” are the aggregate fees billed by KPMG LLP in 2023 and 2022 for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the\nperformance of the audits or reviews of the Company’s financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees.”\n“Tax Fees” are the aggregate fees billed by KPMG LLP in 2023 and 2022 for federal, state, and foreign tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning services.\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees $ 2,471,170 $ 2,289,550\nAudit-Related Fees 723,740 700,000\nTax Fees 16,400 13,440\nTOTAL FEES $ 3,211,310 $ 3,002,990\nOther than as reported above, no other fees were billed by KPMG LLP for 2023 or 2022. All of the services listed above were pre-approved by the Audit\nCommittee under the procedures described below.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 70\nBack to Contents\nPre-approval Policies and Procedures\nThe Audit Committee charter requires the Audit Committee to approve, before services are performed, all audit and permissible non-audit-related services to be\nprovided to the Company by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has delegated to its Chair the authority to\nperform the Audit Committee’s responsibilities with respect to such approvals. The Audit Committee Chair is required to report to the Audit Committee at its next\nmeeting on the manner in which such delegated performance was carried out. Each year since 2002, the engagement of KPMG LLP to provide services to the\nCompany has been approved in advance either by the Audit Committee or by its Chair pursuant to this delegated authority.\nThe Audit Committee annually evaluates the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm and determines whether to engage the current\nindependent auditors or consider other independent audit firms. Factors considered by the Audit Committee in deciding whether to retain the current\nindependent auditors include:\n■ quality of service and sufficiency of resources;\n■ communication and interaction; and\n■ independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism.\nBased on this evaluation, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that retaining KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for\nthe year ending December 31, 2024, is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.\nAlthough the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, the Board is\nrequesting that shareholders ratify such appointment as a matter of good corporate governance. If shareholders do not ratify such appointment, the Audit\nCommittee nevertheless may determine that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to retain KPMG LLP for the year ending December\n31, 2024. Regardless of the vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee at any time during the year may appoint a different independent registered public\naccounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024, if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company\nand its shareholders.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS OUR\nINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL 2024.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 71\nBack to Contents\nReport of the Audit Committee\nThe primary purposes of the Audit Committee, as set forth in its charter, are to oversee the Company’s accounting and financial reporting processes and the\naudits of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and to provide oversight of our risk and compliance management programs. The Audit Committee has\nimplemented procedures to help it execute these responsibilities. During 2023 and through the completion of the audit of the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements for that year, those procedures included regular meetings with management and with appropriate representatives of the Company’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm.\nWe reviewed and discussed both with management and with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nWe also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the\n“PCAOB”) and the SEC.\nWe received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG LLP’s\ncommunications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and have discussed with KPMG LLP its independence.\nBased upon these reviews and discussions, we recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, be included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for such year for filing with the SEC.\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors\nDavid Barnes, Chair\nRonald Cooper\nSilvio Tavares\nTse Li “Lily” Yang\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 72\nBack to Contents\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions, including all transactions required to be disclosed pursuant to Item\n404 of SEC Regulation S-K.\nThere were no related party transactions during 2023 and there are not any currently proposed transactions, in which the Company and any related person were\nor are participants, that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 73\nBack to Contents\nQuestions and Answers about the 2024\nAnnual Meeting and Voting\nHow to Participate in the Annual Meeting\nFor various reasons, including the ongoing health and safety of our shareholders and Board of Directors, and to improve access to the Annual Meeting, we are\nkeeping the online format for the Annual Meeting.

You also can vote all shares for which you hold a valid proxy. At the close of business on the record date, there were 29,789,095 shares of our common\nstock outstanding and entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.\nMay I attend the Annual Meeting?\nThere will not be a physical location for the meeting.

You will need the 16-digit control number included in your Notice of Internet Availability, on your proxy card,\nor on the instructions that accompany your proxy materials.\nMay I vote my shares at the Annual Meeting?\nIf you are a shareholder of record—meaning you hold our common stock in your name with our transfer agent (Computershare Trust Company, N.A.)—you may\nvote your shares online at the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner—meaning that a broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee holds your common stock\nin “street name”—you can vote online during the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a valid proxy from the record holder giving you the right to vote the shares.\nEven if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible so that your vote will be\ncounted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.\nMay I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?\nYou may direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting.

A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank, trustee, or\nother nominee returns a proxy card but does not vote on one or more matters because such broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee does not have the authority\nto do so without instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes and discretionary authority are further described below. If you do not provide voting\ninstructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal except for Proposal 3. For your vote to be counted, you will need to communicate your voting\ninstructions in a timely manner as directed by your broker, bank, or other nominee.\nWhat if I return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions?\nIf you are a shareholder of record and you return your signed proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by\nthe Board.\nMay I change or revoke my vote?\nIf you are a shareholder of record, there are three ways to change or revoke your vote before the conclusion of voting at the Annual Meeting: (1) deliver a new\nproxy bearing a later date by mail, telephone, or over the Internet, which automatically revokes your earlier proxy; (2) provide a written notice of revocation to our\nSecretary at our principal offices listed on the first page of this proxy statement; or (3) vote online during the Annual Meeting. Attending the Annual Meeting\nwithout voting will not affect your previously granted proxy.\nIf you are a beneficial owner, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee. Alternatively, if you\nhave obtained a valid proxy from your broker, bank, trustee, or other nominee giving you the right to personally vote your shares, you can vote online during the\nAnnual Meeting.\nHow many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?\nWe can transact business at the Annual Meeting if a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote are present or represented\nby proxy. Abstentions are counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum.\n“Broker non-votes” will be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum as long as the bank, broker, or nominee uses its discretionary\nauthority to vote on Proposal 3 (the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent auditor for 2024).\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 76\nBack to Contents\nWhat is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?\nEffect of Abstentions and\nProposal Vote Required to Pass Broker Non-votes\nEach nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast for his or her\nProposal 1, Election of election (meaning the number of votes cast FOR a director’s election Abstentions will have no effect\nDirectors exceeds the number of votes cast AGAINST that director’s election) will Broker non-votes will have no effect\nbe elected as a director.\nThe proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares present or Abstentions will have the same effect as\nProposal 2, Advisory Say-on- represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote, AGAINST votes\nPay Vote\nvote FOR approval Broker non-votes will have no effect\nThe proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares present in Abstentions will have the same effect\nProposal 3, Ratification of person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote, as AGAINST votes\nAuditors\nvote FOR approval Broker non-votes will have no effect\nWe use a majority voting standard in the election of directors. Thus, in any “uncontested election” of directors (i.e., an election where the number of nominees\ndoes not exceed the number of directors to be elected), each nominee to the Board will be elected by the vote of a “majority of the votes cast,” meaning that the\nnumber of votes cast FOR a director’s election must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST that director’s election. The election of directors at the Annual\nMeeting is an uncontested election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not count as votes cast for purposes of this proposal.\nIf a continuing director seeking re-election does not receive a majority of the votes cast FOR his or her election, that director must submit a resignation to the\nBoard, with a presumption that the resignation will be accepted unless the Board determines there is a compelling reason for the director to remain on the Board.\nIn the case of a contested election, directors will be elected by a plurality vote, meaning that the nominees who receive the greatest number of votes\ncast FOR their election will be elected.\nHow are votes counted?\nVotes cast will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting. If you provide specific instructions on your proxy card, your shares\nwill be voted as you instruct.\nWhat happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting?\nWe are not aware of any business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting other than the three proposals described in this proxy statement. If you grant a proxy,\nthe individuals named as proxy holders, Brian A.

Our directors, executives, and\nregular employees, without additional remuneration, and their appointed agents, may solicit proxies or votes in person, by telephone, or by electronic\ncommunication. We will request banks, brokers, and other fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the owners of stock held in their names and will reimburse\ntheir reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with that distribution.\nWhere can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?\nWe will announce voting results of the Annual Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC no later than four business days after the Annual\nMeeting.\nCSG SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 77\nBack to Contents\nShareholder Proposals\nA shareholder who would like to have a proposal considered for inclusion in our 2025 proxy statement pursuant to SEC rules must submit the proposal so that\nwe receive it no later than December 2, 2024, unless the date of our 2025 annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or after May 15, 2025, in\nwhich case the proposal must be received a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. SEC rules set standards for eligibility and\nspecify the types of shareholder proposals that may be excluded from a proxy statement. Shareholder proposals should be addressed to the Secretary, CSG\nSystems International, Inc., 169 Inverness Drive West, Suite 300, Englewood, Colorado 80112.\nFor shareholder proposals and shareholder nominations submitted outside of the SEC proposal rules, our bylaws require that the Secretary of the Company\nreceive advance written notice in proper form for matters to be brought before an annual shareholders meeting. We must receive notice of shareholder proposals\nfor the 2025 annual meeting no later than December 2, 2024.
