          "content": "10x Genomics Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nPLEASANTON, Calif. October 29, 2024 – 10x Genomics, Inc. (Nasdaq: TXG), a leader in single cell and spatial biology, today\nreported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nRecent Highlights\n• Revenue was $151.7 million for the third quarter, in line with the company’s preliminary announcement, a 1% decrease\nover the corresponding period of 2023, primarily driven by lower instrument revenue, offset by stronger contributions from\nconsumables.\n• Began shipping GEM-X Flex, setting a new standard for the cost per cell for researchers and enabling them to run millions\nof cells for less than one cent per cell. GEM-X Flex also delivers a number of improvements that are particularly valuable\nfor clinical FFPE samples.\n• Launched GEM-X Universal Multiplex, enabling researchers to run more cost-effective single cell studies decreasing the\ncost per sample, even for small scale experiments.\n• Began shipping Chromium Xo, providing a budget-friendly instrument for routine, high-performance single cell analysis.\n“Our results this quarter fell short of our expectations given greater-than-anticipated disruption from the sales restructuring we\nimplemented in the quarter and cautious customer spending. As these dynamics persist, especially under a difficult macro\nbackdrop, our revenue growth this year will be lower than our previous expectations,” said Serge Saxonov, Co-founder and CEO\nof 10x Genomics. “Despite these challenges, I am confident that the steps we are taking will enable us to reach more customers,\nexecute consistently across the portfolio and drive the broad democratization of our technologies to reach the full potential of the\nlarge opportunity ahead.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenue was $151.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 1% decrease from $153.6 million for the corresponding prior year\nperiod.\nGross margin was 70% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 62% for the corresponding prior year period. The increase\nin gross margin was primarily due to change in product mix.\nOperating expenses were $147.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 22% decrease from $190.3 million for the corresponding\nprior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by a $41.4 million in-process research and development expense related to\nan agreement to acquire certain intangible and other assets in the prior year period.\nOperating loss was $41.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $94.8 million for the corresponding prior year\nperiod. Operating loss includes $33.9 million of stock-based compensation for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to $40.2\nmillion of stock-based compensation for the corresponding prior year period. Operating loss in the third quarter of 2023 included\n$41.4 million of in-process research and development expense.\nNet loss was $35.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to a net loss of $93.0 million for the corresponding prior\nyear period.\nCash and cash equivalents were $398.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\n1\n2024 Financial Guidance\n10x Genomics is updating its outlook for the full year 2024. The company now expects revenue to be in the range of $595 million\nto $605 million versus a prior range of $640 million to $660 million. The updated range represents a 3% decrease from the full\nyear 2023 revenue at the midpoint.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n10x Genomics will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results, business developments and outlook\nafter market close on Tuesday, October 29, 2024, 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time / 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

          "content": "Q3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks\nOctober 29, 2024\nCassie Corneau\nSenior Director, Head of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance\nThank you and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, 10x Genomics released financial results for the third\nquarter ended September 30, 2024. If you have not received this news release, or if you would like to be added to\nthe company's distribution list, please send an email to investors@10xgenomics.com. An archived webcast of this\ncall will be available on the investor tab of the company’s website, 10xgenomics.com, for at least 45 days following\nthis call.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that management will make statements during this call that are forward\nlooking statements within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws. These statements involve material risks and\nuncertainties that could cause actual results or events to materially differ from those anticipated and you should\nnot place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties,\nand factors that could cause results to differ appears in the press release 10x Genomics issued today – and in the\ndocuments and reports filed by 10x Genomics from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n10x Genomics disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any financial projections or forward-looking\nstatements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.\nJoining the call today are: Serge Saxonov, our CEO and Co-Founder and, for his first earnings call with 10x, Adam\nTaich, our new Chief Financial Officer.\nWe will host a question-and-answer session after our prepared remarks. We ask analysts to please keep to one\nquestion so that we may accommodate everyone in the queue.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Serge.\nSerge Saxonov\nChief Executive Officer, Co-founder\nThanks, Cassie, and good afternoon, everyone.\nRevenue for the third quarter declined 1% year-over-year, in line with our pre-announcement. Our results this\nquarter fell short of our expectations. This was primarily caused by more disruption than we had anticipated from\nthe sales restructuring we implemented this quarter, and by cautious customer spending, particularly around capital\npurchases, as we continue to navigate a challenging macro environment.\nWhile these changes in our commercial structure are necessary to drive our growth and strategy, we expect to see\ncontinued headwinds and also expect cautious customer spending to persist. We now expect full-year revenue in\nthe range of $595 million to $605 million. At the midpoint of the range, this implies flat fourth quarter revenue\ncompared to our third quarter results and represents a 3% decline from the prior year. Adam will talk through more\nof the details of our updated guidance range shortly.\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 1\nThere’s no question our revenue growth in 2024 has been disappointing. The year has had a number of moving\npieces that have made it particularly challenging. We initiated major product transitions across all of our platforms\nand significantly evolved our sales organization. All of this with a backdrop of a difficult macro environment and\nchanging competitive dynamics across the portfolio.\nDespite these current headwinds, we continue to believe we are on the path to the most significant transition in the\ntools space since the introduction of NGS. We have the leading portfolio of single cell and spatial technologies,\nand we envision a world in which most tissues will be analyzed using our products.\nThe strategies we are pursuing to accelerate on this pathway are:\n• First, to evolve our commercial structure in order to foster widespread use of our technologies.\n• Second, to create increasingly accessible price points so that we can drive ubiquitous use of our tools\nacross all samples. We intend to be a leader on price, and with our new product launches, we believe we\nnow have the best cost structure for customers across a wide range of experiments. We have shown over\nand over our ability to extend our technological leadership and push frontiers. With these new offerings,\nwe believe we are now the leader in both technology and cost.\n• And, third, to advance our capabilities with new products, workflows and software in order to enhance ease-\nof-use and drive more adoption.\nFinally, we intend to accomplish these objectives with a diligent approach to investment and cash management.\nI am confident that the steps we are taking will enable us to reach more customers, execute consistently across\nthe portfolio and drive the broad democratization of our technologies to reach the full potential of the large\nopportunity ahead.\nFor the rest of the call today, I will discuss what we are doing to advance our strategies and why we are confident\nthey will set us up for future long-term growth. Adam will then provide more detail on our third quarter financials\nand specific impacts to our outlook for the rest of the year.\nLet’s start with the changes we’ve been making to our commercial organization.\nAs we shared on our last earnings call, we re-architected our commercial infrastructure from the ground up, making\nfoundational changes to transform how we engage with our customers. We sell to a diverse set of customer types\nand research segments. And we designed our new sales structure to focus our team to better serve all their distinct\nneeds – whether in academic or biopharma settings, scaling up top-tier customers, driving more adoption among\nemerging users or bringing new researchers into the ecosystem.\nTo accomplish this, we added specialization to key areas by:\n• creating a distinct capital equipment team explicitly focused on driving Xenium instrument placements;\n• creating a distinct biopharma organization, which is focused on better serving the unique needs and\nexpansion opportunities in that sector; and\n• adding a dedicated team to nurture new and emerging accounts, the next generation of 10x customers.\nIn addition to this specialization, we also recalibrated territory sizes to make each territory more manageable and\nto drive more efficient utilization of our sales force.\nWhile these changes were necessary, they did cause more disruption than we anticipated. Ultimately, we saw the\nlargest disruption in the areas where the sales structure changed the most. For example, over 40% of customer\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 2\naccounts in the Americas changed sales coverage within the quarter. And our new biopharma and capital\nequipment teams still have a large number of open roles.\nOur teams now have an improved focus and more defined roles with targeted incentives. I am confident these\nwere the right changes to make and see them already creating more clarity and rigor in our processes.\nThere is still work to do to realize the full potential of our commercial organization. We are working fast to fill our\nopen headcount. Account executives are still onboarding and getting up to speed with their new customers and\nterritories. We expect it will take time before we see the full benefit and impact from our new approach. We are\nconfident these changes will help us deliver the best experience to our customers, open up new opportunities and\ndrive efficient growth across the portfolio.\nTurning to our Chromium portfolio. As we have been communicating for some time, driving into price elasticity has\nbeen a particular focus for us. We recently took another step in this direction by launching new products and\ncapabilities aimed at lowering the cost, and ultimately expanding access, of single cell analysis.\nFirst, we are setting a new standard for the cost per cell for researchers with the launch of GEM-X Flex. Customers\ncan now run millions of cells for less than one cent per cell, an over five-fold reduction compared to previous\nproducts. We are bringing our highest performing and most flexible assay to our new GEM-X technology\narchitecture. GEM-X Flex enables broader opportunities for mega-scale CRISPR screens, cell atlassing projects\nand multi-site translational studies, among others.\nSecond, to decrease the cost per sample, even at a small scale, we launched GEM-X Universal Multiplex. With\nthis product, researchers can batch and run four independent samples, up to 5,000 cells each, for approximately\n$560 per sample. This is a new multiplexing capability for our flagship GEM-X Universal 3' and 5' Gene Expression\nassays, which we launched in March of this year.\nFurthermore, even while we are lowering cost barriers for our customers, these two products have comparable\ngross margins to our current consumables.\nFinally, to address capex barriers, we launched Chromium Xo, our most affordable single cell instrument, at a U.S.\nlist price of only $25,000. Chromium Xo serves as a budget-friendly entry point into routine, high-performance\nsingle cell analysis. Xo enables researchers to generate high-quality data with less hands-on time, labor and\nexperimental costs compared to non-10x workflows. Our GEM-X Universal 3’ Singleplex and Multiplex assays are\navailable on the Xo.\nWith these launches, we are addressing a primary bottleneck for our customers – price. At the same time, we have\nalso delivered new protocols, capabilities and software to enhance ease-of-use and drive more adoption.\nChromium Flex, for example, should be uniquely suited to open up more translational research. It is the only\ncommercial single cell assay compatible with FFPE samples, which are often constrained by limited cell quantities.\nWith GEM-X Flex, we’ve delivered a four-fold reduction in required cell input, significantly expanding the opportunity\nto include vast amounts of biobanked clinical samples that were previously off limits for single cell research.\nAnother example is the unique, on-chip multiplexing workflow built-in to GEM-X Universal Multiplex, which is an\nefficient and elegant way for researchers to analyze more samples in a single run. On-chip multiplexing eliminates\nthe need for upstream sample tagging, simplifying the process and reducing hands-on time compared to other\nsample multiplexing methods.\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 3\nAnd, we have introduced new solutions for upstream sample fixation to improve the workflow; whole blood fixation\nto expand sample compatibility; and library prep automation to enable greater throughput. On the software side,\nwe delivered automated cell annotation, making it easier and faster for researchers to go from experiment to insight.\nCell annotation is a fundamentally hard problem and a critical part of most types of single cell analysis. With this\nnew capability, we are addressing one of the biggest challenges in data analysis for our customers.\nAll together, we are excited about the strength, differentiation and leadership of our single cell portfolio and believe\nthe new products, workflows and software we’ve introduced will enable more researchers to adopt single cell\nmethods for more studies, more often.\nFor additional product information, we encourage you to refer to the Supplemental Materials we posted on our\nInvestor Relations website along with the earnings release.\nAs we continue to execute on single cell, we are also motivated by the immense potential of our spatial platforms.\nWe were encouraged by spatial consumables usage this quarter, with the continued adoption of Visium HD and\nXenium 5K.\nWithin the Visium platform, we are seeing the majority of labs order Visium HD and now that the initial wave of\ncustomers are starting to move past evaluations, we’re beginning to see good reorder trends. In addition, we are\nseeing the majority of new to Visium customers start with HD, an encouraging sign of the benefits this product\nbrings to researchers.\nAdoption of our Visium CytAssist instrument continued at a solid pace. Our experience over the years has made it\nclear that an instrument like CytAssist is key to delivering a complete solution for customers. CytAssist is critical\nfor enabling a robust and straightforward workflow, one that allows customers to use standard histology slides.\nAdditionally, by ensuring consistency, precision and preservation of spatiality, CytAssist is integral to high-quality\ndata and more accurate scientific results for our customers' experiments.\nWithin the Xenium platform, we saw continued adoption of Xenium 5K in Q3, leading to overall Xenium\nconsumables revenue growth sequentially. And we continue to see encouraging utilization trends, with sequential\ngrowth in the number of runs.\nWe consistently hear very strong feedback from our customers on these products, on the data quality and on their\nease of use. These complementary spatial platforms support a broad spectrum of customers' use cases and\naccommodate the ways their research and research questions may evolve over time.\nAs we look forward, I am encouraged by the underlying progress we are making and motivated by the immense\nopportunity I see ahead. Understanding biology requires measuring molecules, cells and tissues at large scale and\nat high resolution. Our technologies are delivering these fundamental capabilities to researchers around the world.\nBut these are still very early days.\nMy conviction is fueled by our customers, both the work they are doing today and their ambitions for the future. I\ncame away from last month’s Human Cell Atlas General Meeting energized by the community’s plans to take on\nlarger, more complex studies; to embark on high impact translational projects; and to explore new single cell and\nspatial applications that could transform the world’s understanding of health and disease. Conversations like these\nreinforce my belief that single cell and spatial continue to be some of the most exciting and game-changing\nopportunities in the life sciences.\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 4\nWhile we continue to see strong adoption with cutting-edge genomics researchers, we believe there is an even\nlarger opportunity across the broader space of academic research whether in basic science or in translational\napplications. This opportunity spans across many different fields including oncology, immunology, neuroscience,\nmetabolic health, women’s health, infectious disease, aging and multiple others. We know this opportunity exists\nbecause we see early interest and use from many new kinds of customers — just not yet routinely or at scale.\nEven among our well-established academic customers, we are seeing interest in running larger scale experiments\n– whether moving toward translational applications, analyzing large patient cohorts or embarking on massive cell\nscreening campaigns.\nIn biopharma, there is increasing interest to apply single cell and spatial technologies across the entire continuum\nof the drug development process. For example, many groups are focused on applying single cell and spatial tools\nfor target identification and drug discovery, especially in the context of large scale CRISPR experiments or\ncombinatorial drug screens. In preclinical work, the emergence of organoids as a superior research model should\nopen up a broad range of use-cases, including characterization of disease development, progression and therapy\nmechanism of action. We believe cell therapy development is another exciting opportunity, as our tools have the\npotential to accelerate biomarker discovery and screening, enhance cellular environment profiling, and support\ndrug product characterization. And there exists an even larger space of translational applications to apply our\ntechnologies in clinical trials, which in many ways is only now becoming possible.\nWe have built a sizable franchise with single cell and a solid foundation in spatial. And while this year has certainly\nhad its challenges, we firmly believe there’s a vast opportunity ahead and that we are the best company to deliver\non it.\nBefore I turn it over to Adam, I’d like to officially welcome him to 10x. On our last call, we announced he would be\njoining as our new CFO, and I’m really excited to have him onboard.\nWith that, I’ll turn it over to Adam.\nAdam Taich\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Serge.\nIt’s great to be here at 10x, working with such a dedicated and resilient team.\nI'll start by reviewing our financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and will then provide\nfurther details on our updated outlook for 2024. All growth rates provided will be on a year-over-year basis, unless\notherwise noted.\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $151.7 million, down 1% driven by weaker instruments revenue, primarily Xenium\ninstruments, offset by stronger contributions from consumables.\nLooking at our revenue breakout, total consumables revenue was $126.2 million, up 10%.\nChromium consumables revenue was $96.5 million, down 4% year-over-year driven primarily by lower average\nprices offset by increased consumables volumes.\nSpatial consumables revenue was $29.7 million, up 111%, driven primarily by continued demand for the new\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 5\nSpatial consumables products introduced this year, Visium HD and Xenium 5K.\nMoving onto instruments, total instrument revenue decreased 45% to $19.1 million.\nChromium instrument revenue was $7.6 million, down 38% driven by fewer units sold. Spatial instrument revenue\nwas down 50% to $11.4 million driven by a lower number of Xenium instruments sold.\nServices revenue was $6.4 million, up 48%.\nLooking at our revenue by geography, Americas decreased 11% to $87.8 million. EMEA grew 18% to $37.9 million.\nAnd revenue in APAC increased 15% to $26.0 million. The most significant changes in our commercial\nreorganization were in the Americas, which contributed to the regional disparities.\nTurning to the rest of the income statement. Gross profit for the third quarter was $106.4 million compared to $95.5\nmillion for the prior year period. Gross margin increased to 70%, from 62% the year prior, driven by change in\nproduct mix, which was predominantly fewer Xenium instruments.\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter decreased to $147.9 million compared to $190.3 million for the prior\nyear period. This decrease was primarily driven by a $41.4 million in-process research and development expense\nrelated to an agreement to acquire certain intangible and other assets in the prior year period.\nR&D expenses decreased to $66.2 million compared to $66.5 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by\nlower personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, partially offset by higher laboratory\nmaterials and supplies.\nSG&A expenses decreased to $81.7 million compared to $82.4 million for the prior year period, primarily driven by\nlower personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher outside legal expenses.\nOperating loss for the third quarter was $41.5 million compared to a loss of $94.8 million in the third quarter last\nyear. This includes $33.9 million of stock-based compensation, as compared to $40.2 million of stock-based\ncompensation for the corresponding prior year period. Operating loss in the third quarter of 2023 included $41.4\nmillion of in-process research and development expenses.\nNet loss for the period was $35.8 million compared to a net loss of $93.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nWe ended the quarter with $398.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nTurning to our outlook for the rest of the year. As Serge mentioned at the beginning of the call, we now expect full\nyear revenue to be in the range of $595 million to $605 million, representing a 3% decrease from full year 2023 at\nthe midpoint.\nAt the midpoint, our updated guidance range implies approximately flat fourth quarter revenue compared to our\nthird quarter results. Within Chromium, we are assuming a continuation of decreasing price per reaction, while\nassuming an uptick in volumes. Within Spatial, we are assuming similar results to what we experienced in Q3.\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call Prepared Remarks Page 6\nThe drivers of our assumptions are:\n• First, ongoing headwinds from our commercial restructuring. While we implemented the new structure in\nmid-Q3, our efforts remain ongoing as we make new hires to fill our re-designed territories and teams, train\nnew sales reps and solidify processes.\n• And second, the macro environment continues to be challenging. We are still seeing cautious customer\nspending, putting pressure on both capex purchases, as well as larger consumables projects. Given this,\nwe are not counting on the typical seasonality that we tend to see in Q4.\nWhile we anticipate these factors will impact Q4 and into next year, I want to affirm that we are taking the\nappropriate and necessary steps to take advantage of our opportunity.\nWe are taking a disciplined look at our spend in our 2025 planning. We generated $18 million of cash in Q3, but I\nwould note that much of this is due to timing and we expect this to offset in Q4. We are focused on maintaining a\nstrong balance sheet going forward.\nAt this point, I'll turn it back to Serge.\nSerge Saxonov\nChief Executive Officer, Co-founder\nThanks, Adam.\nThe end point is clear: biology needs to be analyzed at the single cell level and in spatial context. However, as\n2024 has shown, the path to get there is not linear. I’m incredibly grateful to the 10x team for staying focused on\nour mission and our customers as we navigate this period of change and push through these challenges.\nI have strong conviction that the actions we’re taking now are necessary to deliver our long-term opportunity and\nfulfill the promise of single cell and spatial biology. We will continue to execute with urgency and excellence as we\nwork to foster widespread use of our technologies and create value for all stakeholders.\nWith that, we will now open it up for questions.

Inc.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\no\n1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation\nOrganization and Description of Business\n10x Genomics, Inc. (the “Company”) is a life sciences technology company focused on building innovative products and solutions to interrogate, understand and\nmaster biological systems at resolution and scale that matches the complexity of biology. The Company’s integrated solutions include the Company’s Chromium X Series\nand Chromium Connect instruments, which the Company refers to as “Chromium instruments,” the Company’s Visium CytAssist and Xenium Analyzer instruments,\nwhich the Company refers to as “Spatial instruments,” and the Company’s proprietary microfluidic chips, slides, reagents and other consumables for the Company’s\nChromium, Visium and Xenium solutions, which the Company refers to as “consumables.” The Company bundles its software with these products to guide customers\nthrough the workflow, from sample preparation through analysis and visualization. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in July 2012 and began\ncommercial and manufacturing operations and selling its instruments and consumables in 2015. The Company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California and has wholly-\nowned subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, Oceania and North America.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, which include the Company’s accounts and the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, are\nunaudited and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The condensed consolidated balance sheet at\nDecember 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company at that date. Certain information and footnote disclosures\ntypically included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments,\nwhich include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the Company’s financial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows for\nthe periods presented, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for any future annual or interim period. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024\n(our “Annual Report”).\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThere were no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 2 – Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report for information regarding the Company’s significant\naccounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from sales of products and services, and its products consist of instruments and consumables. Revenue from product sales is\nrecognized when control of the product is transferred, which is generally upon shipment to the customer. Instrument service agreements, which relate to extended\nwarranties, are typically entered into for one-year terms, following the expiration of the standard one-year warranty period. Revenue for extended warranties is\nrecognized ratably over the term of the extended warranty period as a stand ready performance obligation. Revenue is recorded net of discounts, distributor commissions\nand sales taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Customers are invoiced generally upon shipment, or upon order for services, and payment is typically due\nwithin 30 days. Cash received from customers in advance of product shipment or providing services is recorded as a contract liability. The Company’s contracts with its\ncustomers generally do not include rights of return or a significant financing component.\nThe Company regularly enters into contracts that include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate\nperformance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to its standalone selling price. The Company determines\nstandalone selling price using average selling\n9\nTable of Contents\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nprices with consideration of current market conditions. If the product or service has no history of sales or if the sales volume is not sufficient, the Company relies upon\nprices set by management, adjusted for applicable discounts.\nNet Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share is computed using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights and sharing of losses, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. As the liquidation\nand dividend rights and sharing of losses are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis and the resulting net loss per share will, therefore,\nbe the same for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or combined basis.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, adjusted for\noutstanding shares that are subject to repurchase.\nFor the calculation of diluted net loss per share, basic net loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities including awards under the Company’s equity\ncompensation plans. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For periods in\nwhich the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because potentially dilutive shares of common stock are not\nassumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncement and Disclosure Rules\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires all public entities, including public entities with a single reportable segment, to\nprovide in interim and annual periods one or more measures of segment profit or loss used by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess\nperformance. Additionally, the standard requires disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items as well as incremental qualitative disclosures. The\nguidance in this update is effective for the Company’s fiscal year 2024 annual reporting period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this\npronouncement on its related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes, which prescribes standardized categories and disaggregation of information in the\nreconciliation of provision for income taxes, requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, and modifies other income tax-related disclosure requirements. The\nupdated standard is effective beginning with the Company’s fiscal year 2025 annual reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact that the updated standard will have on its related disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Final Rule No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related\nDisclosures for Investors. If effected as issued, the rule would require registrants to provide certain climate related disclosures in their annual reports. While in April 2024\nthe SEC stayed Final Rule No. 33-11275 in connection with legal challenges to the rule, the Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of the rule on its related\ndisclosures.\n3.

The Company incurred gross realized losses of $1.7 million and no gross realized gains from the sale of available-for-sales debt securities during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Realized gains (losses) on the sale of marketable securities are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe available-for-sale debt securities are subject to a periodic impairment review. For investments in an unrealized loss position, the Company determines whether\na credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic\nconditions. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses, up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate, and writes down the amortized cost basis\nof the investment if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required or will intend to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAllowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in “Other income (expense), net,” and unrealized losses not related to credit losses are recognized in\n“Accumulated other comprehensive loss.” There are no allowances for credit losses for the periods presented.\nInventory\nInventory was comprised of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nPurchased materials $ 38,031 $ 34,484\nWork in progress 27,067 21,975\nFinished goods 28,952 17,247\nInventory $ 94,050 $ 73,706\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in thousands):\n11\nTable of Contents\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nNotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nLand $ 36,765 $ 36,765\nBuilding 146,944 146,044\nLaboratory equipment and machinery 71,852 69,238\nComputer equipment and software 15,774 16,379\nFurniture and fixtures 10,511 10,979\nLeasehold improvements 97,097 96,405\nConstruction in progress 4,443 7,252\nTotal property and equipment 383,386 383,062\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (124,627) (103,491)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 258,759 $ 279,571\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $2.1 million related to computer equipment and software of\nwhich $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $1.1 million was classified in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses,\nrespectively, in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

(“NanoString”) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that\nNanoString’s GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and associated instruments and reagents infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 10,472,669, 10,662,467, 10,961,566, 10,983,113 and\n10,996,219 (the “GeoMx Action”). On May 19, 2021, the Company filed an amended complaint additionally alleging that the GeoMx products infringe U.S. Patent Nos.\n11,001,878 and 11,008,607. On May 4, 2022, the Company filed an amended complaint in the GeoMx Action additionally alleging that the GeoMx products infringe\nU.S. Patent No. 11,293,917 and withdrawing the Company’s claims of infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,662,467. The Company is seeking, among other relief,\ninjunctive relief and unspecified damages (including attorneys’ fees) in relation to NanoString’s making, using, selling, offering to sell, exporting and/or importing in the\nUnited States the GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler and associated instruments and reagents. NanoString filed its answer to the GeoMx Action on May 18, 2022. A\nMarkman hearing was held on February 17, 2023 and the Court issued its claim construction order on February 28, 2023. On September 7, 2023, the Court issued an\norder granting the Company’s motion for summary judgment that the asserted patents are not invalid for indefiniteness and denying NanoString’s motion for summary\njudgment that the asserted patents are invalid for indefiniteness and lack of written description. On November 17, 2023, a jury found that NanoString willfully infringed\nthe asserted patents and that the asserted patents are valid. The jury awarded the Company more than $31 million in damages, consisting of approximately $25 million in\nlost profits and approximately $6 million in royalties. Post-trial motions, including the Company’s motions for a permanent injunction, ongoing royalties, enhanced\ndamages, attorneys’ fees and pre- and post-judgment interest, are pending. NanoString filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy\nCode in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware on February 4, 2024, and the Court’s consideration of these post-trial motions was stayed due to the bankruptcy filing. In\nMay 2024, Bruker Corporation (“Bruker”) acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of NanoString, including the litigation between the Company and\nNanoString, and the NanoString product lines at issue. Bruker, Bruker Spatial Biology, Inc. and Bruker Nano, Inc. were substituted as defendants in the GeoMx Action.\nPost-trial briefing is complete following supplementation by the parties. Due to the uncertainties in collecting the jury award, the Company has not recorded a receivable\nfrom NanoString as of September 30, 2024.\nOn February 28, 2022, the Company filed a second suit against NanoString in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NanoString’s\nCosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 10,227,639 and 11,021,737 (the “CosMx Action”). On May\n12, 2022, the Company filed an amended complaint in the CosMx Action additionally alleging that the CosMx products additionally infringe U.S. Patent Nos.\n11,293,051, 11,293,052 and 11,293,054. NanoString filed its answer to the CosMx Action on May 26, 2022. On March 1, 2023, the Company filed a second amended\ncomplaint additionally alleging that the CosMx products infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,542,554. The Company is seeking, among other relief, injunctive relief and\nunspecified damages (including attorneys’ fees) in relation to NanoString’s making, using, selling, offering to sell, exporting and/or importing in the United States the\nCosMx Spatial Molecular Imager and associated instruments, reagents and services. NanoString filed its answer to the second amended complaint on March 22, 2023.\nDiscovery is in progress. A Markman hearing was held on January 10, 2024, and the Court issued its claim construction order on February 1, 2024.\nOn August 16, 2022, NanoString filed a counterclaim in the CosMx Action alleging that the Company’s Visium products infringe U.S. Patent No. 11,377,689 (the\n“689 patent”). The Company filed its answer to NanoString’s counterclaim in the CosMx Action on August 30, 2022. On November 23, 2022, the Company moved to\nsever claims relating to NanoString’s assertion of the 689 patent and consolidate those claims with the patent case NanoString filed against the Company on October 20,\n2022 (discussed below). On January 24, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s motion.\nOn May 1, 2023, NanoString filed a motion in the CosMx Action to add antitrust, unfair competition, tort and contract counterclaims.

As discussed in the section titled “Special Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements,” the following discussion and analysis, in addition to historical financial information, contains forward-looking statements that involve\nrisks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including\nthose set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” in this Quarterly Report and Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report.\nIn addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon\ninformation available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information\nmay be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available\nrelevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.\nOverview\nWe are a life sciences technology company focused on building innovative products and solutions to interrogate, understand and master biology. Our integrated\nsolutions include instruments, consumables and software for analyzing biological systems at resolution and scale that matches the complexity of biology. We have\nlaunched multiple products that enable researchers to understand and interrogate biological analytes in their full biological context. Our commercial product portfolio\nleverages our Chromium X Series and Chromium Connect instruments, which we refer to as “Chromium instruments,” our Visium CytAssist, an instrument designed to\nsimplify the Visium solution workflow by facilitating the transfer of transcriptomic probes from standard glass slides to Visium slides, and our Xenium Analyzer, an\ninstrument designed for fully automated high-throughput analysis of cells in their tissue environment, which we refer to as “Spatial instruments,” and our proprietary\nmicrofluidic chips, slides, reagents and other consumables for our Chromium, Visium and Xenium solutions, which we refer to as “consumables.” We bundle our\nsoftware with these products to guide customers through the workflow, from sample preparation through analysis and visualization.\nOur products cover a wide variety of applications and allow researchers to analyze biological systems at fundamental resolutions and on massive scale, such as at\nthe single cell level for millions of cells. Customers purchase instruments and consumables from us for use in their experiments. In addition to instrument and\nconsumable sales, we derive revenue from post-warranty service contracts for our instruments.\nSince our inception in 2012, we have incurred net losses in each year. Our net losses were $35.8 million and $133.6 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and $93.0 million and $206.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

The increase was\n23\nTable of Contents\nprimarily due to interest income generated from our cash equivalents and marketable securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting an\nincrease in interest rates.\nOther expense, net decreased by $3.3 million, or 267% to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Other expense, net decreased by $5.3 million, or 123% to $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were driven by realized and unrealized losses from foreign currency rate measurement fluctuations.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes was $1.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and\n$1.2 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Deferred tax assets related to our domestic operations are fully\noffset by a valuation allowance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $398.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have generated negative cumulative cash flows from operations since inception\nthrough September 30, 2024, and we have generated losses from operations since inception as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion.\nWe currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between approximately $15 million and $20 million during the next 12 months, which we expect\nto include, among other expenditures, equipment to be used for manufacturing and research and development.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, research and development efforts, investments in or acquisitions\nof complementary or enhancing technologies or businesses, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new facilities, the expansion\nof sales and marketing and international activities, legal costs associated with defending and enforcing intellectual property rights and the introduction of new products.\nWe take a long-term view in growing and scaling our business and we regularly review acquisition and investment opportunities, and we may in the future enter\ninto arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, real estate, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights, and any such acquisitions or investments\ncould significantly increase our capital needs. We regularly review opportunities that meet our long-term growth objectives.\nWe expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from sales of\nour products will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we\ncould exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S.\nand multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the\nevent of failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured\nfunds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate market conditions and may in the future pursue additional sources of funding, such as mortgage or other financing, to further\nenhance our financial position and to execute our business strategy. In addition, should prevailing economic, financial, business or other factors adversely affect our\nability to meet our operating cash requirements, we could be required to obtain funding though traditional or alternative sources of financing. We cannot be certain that\nadditional funds would be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.\nSources of liquidity\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock and common stock, revenue\nfrom sales of our products and the incurrence of indebtedness.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in thousands) 2024 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 13,412 $ (40,955)\nInvesting activities 18,961 120,394\nFinancing activities 6,397 8,056\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 105 (110)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 38,875 $ 87,385\nOperating activities\nThe net cash provided by operating activities of $13.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a net loss of $133.6 million, net\ncash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.6 million, primarily offset by stock-based compensation expense of $108.2 million, depreciation and\namortization of $27.1 million, lease and asset impairment charges of $2.5 million, amortization of leased right-of-use assets of $6.0 million, and other non-cash expenses\nof $0.6 million. The net cash inflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an decrease in accounts receivable of $31.3 million due to timing of\ncollections, increase in accounts payable of $10.0 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $8.1 million. The net cash inflow from operating assets and liabilities\nwas partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $17.1 million primarily driven by payments related to purchase consideration and\nroyalty payments, an increase in inventory of $19.4 million, and a decrease in operating lease liability of $9.8 million.\nThe net cash used in operating activities of $41.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a net loss of $206.1 million, of\nwhich $41.4 million related to in-process research and development expense, partially offset by stock-based compensation expense of $128.0 million, depreciation and\namortization of $25.8 million, amortization of leased right-of-use assets of $6.1 million, lease impairment charges of $2.8 million, realized losses on sale of marketable\nsecurities of $1.7 million, other non-cash expenses of $0.5 million and net cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.3 million. The net cash\ninflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $9.2 million, an increase in deferred\nrevenue of $6.6 million, an increase in other noncurrent liabilities of $0.6 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $0.4 million. The net cash inflow from\noperating assets and liabilities was primarily offset by a decrease in operating lease liability of $5.9 million, a decrease in accrued compensation and other related benefits\nof $4.2 million primarily related to the prior year annual bonus payments, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.6 million and a decrease in\naccounts payable of $2.8 million due to timing of vendor payments.\nInvesting activities\nThe net cash provided by investing activities of $19.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to proceeds from sales and maturities of\nmarketable securities of $3.9 million and $25.8 million, respectively, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets of $9.7 million and\n$1.0 million, respectively.\nThe net cash provided by investing activities of $120.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to proceeds from sales and maturities of\nmarketable securities of $96.1 million and $70.3 million, respectively, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets of $45.2 million and\n$0.9 million, respectively.\nFinancing activities\nThe net cash provided by financing activities of $6.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily from proceeds related to the issuance of\ncommon stock from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan.\nThe net cash provided by financing activities of $8.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily from proceeds of $13.9 million from the\nissuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by payments on financing arrangements of $5.8 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n25\nTable of Contents\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for\ninterim financial information and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as\nthe reported revenues and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we\nbelieve are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThere have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the\ncritical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\nincluded in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nFor financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures about Market Risk” contained in Part II of our Annual Report. Our exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the\nperiod covered by this Quarterly Report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or\nsubmit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired\ncontrol objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance\nlevel as of September 30, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n26\nTable of Contents\n10x Genomics, Inc.\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are regularly subject to lawsuits, claims, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions and other legal and regulatory proceedings involving intellectual property\ndisputes, commercial disputes, competition and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of lawsuits, claims, arbitration proceedings, administrative\nactions, government investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings in the future and as our business grows, including proceedings related to product liability or our\nacquisitions, securities issuances or our business practices, including public disclosures about our business. Our success depends in part on our non-infringement of the\npatents or proprietary rights of third parties. In the past, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology\nwithout authorization. We have been involved in multiple patent litigation matters and other proceedings in the past and we expect that given the litigious history of our\nindustry and the high profile of operating as a public company, third parties may claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We have also initiated\nlitigation to defend our technology including technology developed through our significant investments in research and development. It is our general policy not to out-\nlicense our patents but to protect our sole right to own and practice them. There are inherent uncertainties in these legal matters, some of which are beyond management’s\ncontrol, making the ultimate outcomes difficult to predict.\nRefer to Note 4 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere have been no material changes to our risk factors that we believe are material to our business, results of operations and financial condition from the risk factors\npreviously disclosed in our Annual Report, and any documents incorporated by reference therein, which is accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nItem 5. Other Information\nNone of our directors or officers adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as such terms are defined under Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K, except as follows:\nOn September 12, 2024, Serge Saxonov, Chief Executive Officer, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule\n10b5-1(c) for the sale of up to 35,600 shares of the Company’s common stock plus up to 136,000 carryover shares from a prior 10b5-1 plan that will expire on December\n31, 2024, subject to certain conditions.

No Right to Con\u0000nued Employment or Service.\nNeither the Plan nor this Agreement nor Par\u0000cipant’s receipt of the Op\u0000on hereunder shall impose any obliga\u0000on on the Company or\nany Affiliate to con\u0000nue the employment or service of Par\u0000cipant.

Service Condi\u0000ons.\nThe following provisions shall only apply to Par\u0000cipant if Par\u0000cipant resides outside the United States: In accep\u0000ng the Op\u0000on,\nPar\u0000cipant acknowledges that:\n(a) Any no\u0000ce period mandated under local law shall not be treated as service for the purpose of determining the ves\u0000ng of the Op\u0000on;\nand Par\u0000cipant’s right to exercise the Op\u0000on a\u0000er termina\u0000on of service, if any, will be measured by the date of termina\u0000on of\nPar\u0000cipant’s ac\u0000ve service and will not be extended by any no\u0000ce period mandated under local law. Subject to the foregoing and the\nprovisions of the Plan, the Company, in its sole discre\u0000on, shall determine whether Par\u0000cipant’s service has terminated and the effec\u0000ve\ndate of such termina\u0000on.\n(b) The ves\u0000ng of the Op\u0000on shall cease upon, and no Shares shall become vested following, Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on of service for any\nreason except as may be explicitly provided by the Plan or this Agreement.\n(c) The Plan is established voluntarily by the Company. It is discre\u0000onary in nature and it may be modified, amended, suspended or\nterminated by the Company at any \u0000me, unless otherwise provided in the Plan and this Agreement.\n(d) The grant of the Op\u0000on is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of\nOp\u0000ons, or benefits in lieu of Op\u0000ons, even if Op\u0000ons have been granted repeatedly in the past.\n7\n(e) All decisions with respect to future Op\u0000on grants, if any, will be at the sole discre\u0000on of the Company.\n(f) Par\u0000cipant’s par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan shall not create a right to further service with the Company or any Subsidiary and shall not\ninterfere with the ability of any Subsidiary to terminate Par\u0000cipant’s service at any \u0000me, with or without cause subject to applicable law.\n(g) Par\u0000cipant is voluntarily par\u0000cipa\u0000ng in the Plan.\n(h) The Op\u0000on is an extraordinary item that does not cons\u0000tute compensa\u0000on of any kind for service of any kind rendered to any\nSubsidiary, and which is outside the scope of Par\u0000cipant’s employment contract, if any.\n(i) The Op\u0000on is not part of normal or expected compensa\u0000on or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calcula\u0000ng any\nseverance, resigna\u0000on, termina\u0000on, redundancy, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or re\u0000rement\nbenefits or similar payments.\n(j) In the event that Par\u0000cipant is not an employee of the Company or Subsidiary, the Op\u0000on grant will not be interpreted to form an\nemployment contract or rela\u0000onship with the Company or Subsidiary; and furthermore, the Op\u0000on grant will not be interpreted to form\nan employment contract with any other Subsidiary.\n(k) The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty. If the underlying Shares do not increase in\nvalue, the Op\u0000on will have no value. If Par\u0000cipant exercises the Op\u0000on and obtains Shares, the value of those Shares acquired upon\nexercise may increase or decrease in value, even below the Exercise Price.\n(l) No claim or en\u0000tlement to compensa\u0000on or damages arises from termina\u0000on of the Op\u0000on or diminu\u0000on in value of the Op\u0000on or\nShares purchased through exercise of the Op\u0000on resul\u0000ng from termina\u0000on of Par\u0000cipant’s service (for any reason whether or not in\nbreach of local law) and Par\u0000cipant irrevocably releases the Company and each other Subsidiary from any such claim that may arise. If,\nnotwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdic\u0000on to have arisen then, by signing this\nAgreement, Par\u0000cipant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived Par\u0000cipant’s en\u0000tlement to pursue such a claim.\n13. Adjustments.\nThe terms of this Agreement, including, without limita\u0000on, (a) the number of Shares subject to the Op\u0000on and (b) the Exercise Price\nspecified herein, will be subject to adjustment in accordance with Sec\u0000on 11 of the Plan.\n14. Securi\u0000es Laws; Coopera\u0000on.\nUpon the ves\u0000ng of any unvested por\u0000on of the Op\u0000on, Par\u0000cipant will make or enter into such wri\u0000en representa\u0000ons, warran\u0000es and\nagreements as the Commi\u0000ee may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securi\u0000es laws, the Plan or this Agreement.\nPar\u0000cipant further agrees to cooperate with the Company in taking any ac\u0000on reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the\ntransac\u0000ons contemplated by this Agreement.\n15. No\u0000ces.\nAny no\u0000ce necessary under this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Secretary at the principal execu\u0000ve office of\nthe Company and to Par\u0000cipant at the address appearing in the personnel records of the Company for such Par\u0000cipant or to either party at such\nother address as either party hereto may herea\u0000er designate in wri\u0000ng to the other. Any such no\u0000ce shall be deemed effec\u0000ve upon receipt\nthereof by the addressee.\n8\n16. Governing Law; Venue; Jury Trial Waiver; Language.\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts\nmade and performed wholly within the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.

Par\u0000cipant authorizes the Company\nand any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implemen\u0000ng, administering, and\nmanaging the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or another form, for the sole purpose of\nimplemen\u0000ng, administering and managing his or her par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan.\n(d) Par\u0000cipant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage his or her par\u0000cipa\u0000on\nin the Plan, including to maintain records regarding par\u0000cipa\u0000on.

If Par\u0000cipant does not consent or if he or\nshe later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his or her engagement as a service provider with the Company and any Affiliates or\nSubsidiaries will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing his or her consent is that the Company will\nnot be able to grant him or her Op\u0000on under the Plan or administer or maintain Op\u0000on. Therefore, Par\u0000cipant understands that refusing\nor withdrawing his or her consent may affect his or her ability to par\u0000cipate in the Plan (including the right to retain the Op\u0000on).\nPar\u0000cipant understands that he or she may contact his or her local human resources representa\u0000ve for more informa\u0000on on the\nconsequences of his or her refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent.\nThe following provisions shall only apply to Par\u0000cipant if he or she resides in the EU or EEA, the UK, or EU privacy laws are otherwise\napplicable:\n(e) Data Collected and Purposes of Collec\u0000on.

The Data is collected from Par\u0000cipant,\nand from the Company and any Affiliates or Subsidiaries, for the purpose of implemen\u0000ng, administering, and managing the Plan\npursuant to its terms. The legal basis (that is, the legal jus\u0000fica\u0000on) for processing the Data is that it is necessary to perform, administer\nand manage the Plan pursuant to this Agreement between Par\u0000cipant and the Company, and in Company’s legi\u0000mate interests to\ncomply with applicable non-EU laws when performing, administering and managing the Plan, subject to his or her interest and\nfundamental rights.

Par\u0000cipant understands that the Data will be transferred to and among the Company and any Affiliates\nor Subsidiaries, as well as service providers (such as stock administra\u0000on providers, brokers, transfer agents, accoun\u0000ng firms, payroll\nprocessing firms or tax firms), for the purposes explained above, which are necessary to allow the Company to perform this Agreement.\nPar\u0000cipant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States and in other jurisdic\u0000ons outside of the\nEuropean Economic Area where the Company and any Affiliates or Subsidiaries or its service providers have opera\u0000ons. The United\nStates and some of\n10\nthese other jurisdic\u0000ons have not been found by the European Commission to have adequate data protec\u0000on safeguards. If the\nCompany and any Affiliates or Subsidiaries make transfers of Data outside of the European Economic Area, those transfers will be made\nsolely to the extent necessary to perform this Agreement and take necessary ac\u0000ons in connec\u0000on with such performance. In addi\u0000on,\nservice providers may commit to providing adequate safeguards for the transferred Data, such as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework or\nstandard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. In that case, Par\u0000cipant may obtain details of the transfers by\ncontac\u0000ng gc@10xgenomics.com.\n(g) Par\u0000cipant’s Rights in Respect of Data.

The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express\nassump\u0000on and condi\u0000on that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Subsidiary, over and above the specific terms of\nthe Plan. Consequently, Par\u0000cipant understands that the Op\u0000ons are granted on the assump\u0000on and condi\u0000on that the Op\u0000ons and any Shares acquired\nupon exercise of the Op\u0000ons are not part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any Subsidiary) and shall not be considered a\nmandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensa\u0000on) or any other right whatsoever. In addi\u0000on, Par\u0000cipant understands that\nthe Op\u0000ons would not be granted to Par\u0000cipant but for the assump\u0000ons and condi\u0000ons referred to herein; thus, Par\u0000cipant acknowledges and freely\naccepts that should any or all of the assump\u0000ons be mistaken or should any of the condi\u0000ons not be met for any reason, then the grant of the Op\u0000ons\nshall be null and void.\nThe Op\u0000ons are condi\u0000onal rights to Shares and will be forfeited in the case of Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on of employment. This will be the case even if (1)\nPar\u0000cipant is considered to be unfairly dismissed without cause (despido improcedente); (2) Par\u0000cipant is dismissed for disciplinary or objec\u0000ve reasons\nor due to a collec\u0000ve dismissal, whether adjudged or recognized to be with or without cause; (3) Par\u0000cipant terminates employment due to a change of\nwork loca\u0000on, du\u0000es or any other material modifica\u0000on of the terms of employment; (4) Par\u0000cipant terminates employment due to unilateral breach of\ncontract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (5) Par\u0000cipant’s employment terminates for any other reason whatsoever (including, but not\nlimited to, mutual agreement, resigna\u0000on, re\u0000rement, death, permanent disability, causes included in the employment contract, expiry of the\ntemporary contract, force majeure and under Ar\u0000cle 10.3 of the Royal Decree Law 1382/1985). Consequently, upon termina\u0000on of Par\u0000cipant’s\nemployment for any of the reasons set forth above, Par\u0000cipant will automa\u0000cally lose any rights to the unvested Op\u0000ons granted to him or her as of the\ndate of Par\u0000cipant’s termina\u0000on of employment, as described in the Plan and this Agreement.\nNo\u0000fica\u0000ons\nSecuri\u0000es Law No\u0000ce.\nThe grant of Op\u0000on under the Plan is exempt or excluded from the requirement to publish a prospectus under the EU Prospectus Regula\u0000on as\nimplemented in Spain.\nThe Op\u0000on does not qualify under Spanish Law as securi\u0000es. No “offer to the public,” as defined under Spanish Law, has taken place or will take place in\nthe Spanish territory. Neither the Plan nor this Agreement have been registered with the Comisión Nacronal del Mercado de Valores and do not\ncons\u0000tute a public offering prospectus.\nForeign Asset/Account Repor\u0000ng Informa\u0000on.

A\u0000er such Shares and/or accounts are ini\u0000ally reported, the repor\u0000ng obliga\u0000on will apply for subsequent years only if the\nvalue of any previously-reported Shares or accounts increases by more than a certain legally designated amount. Par\u0000cipant shall consult his or her\npersonal advisor in this regard. Further, Par\u0000cipant is required to declare electronically to the Bank of Spain any securi\u0000es accounts (including brokerage\naccounts held abroad), as well as the Shares held in such accounts, if the value of the transac\u0000ons during the prior tax year or the balances in such\naccounts as of December 31 of the prior tax year exceed a certain legally designated amount. The thresholds for\n38\nforeign asset/account repor\u0000ng are subject to change. Therefore, Par\u0000cipant shall consult his or her personal advisor in this regard.\nForeign Currency Payments.\nWhen receiving foreign currency payments exceeding €50,000 derived from the ownership of Shares (i.e., dividends or proceeds from the sale of the\nShares), Par\u0000cipant must inform the financial ins\u0000tu\u0000on receiving the payment of the basis upon which such payment is made. Par\u0000cipant will need to\nprovide the following informa\u0000on: (i) Par\u0000cipant’s name, address, and fiscal iden\u0000fica\u0000on number; (ii) the name and corporate domicile of the\nCompany; (iii) the amount of the payment and the currency used; (iv) the country of origin; (v) the reasons for the payment; and (vi) further informa\u0000on\nthat may be required.\n39\nSWEDEN\nNo\u0000fica\u0000ons\nSecuri\u0000es Disclaimer.\nPar\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan is exempt or excluded from the requirement to publish a prospectus under the EU Prospectus Regula\u0000on as implemented in\nSweden.\nTerms and Condi\u0000ons\nExchange Control.\nPar\u0000cipant understands and agrees that foreign and local banks or financial ins\u0000tu\u0000ons (including brokers) engaged in cross-border transac\u0000ons\ngenerally may be required to report any payments to or from a foreign country exceeding a certain amount to The Na\u0000onal Tax Board, which receives\nthe informa\u0000on on behalf of the Swedish Central Bank (Sw.Riksbanken). This requirement may apply even if Par\u0000cipant has a brokerage account with a\nforeign broker.\n40\nSWITZERLAND\nNo\u0000fica\u0000ons\nSecuri\u0000es Law No\u0000fica\u0000on.\nThe grant of the Op\u0000on is considered a private offering in Switzerland and is, therefore, not subject to registra\u0000on in Switzerland.

The Restricted Stock Unit is not part of normal or expected compensa\u0000on or salary for any purpose, including, but not limited to, calcula\u0000ng any\nseverance, resigna\u0000on, termina\u0000on, redundancy, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or re\u0000rement benefits or\nsimilar payments.\nj. In the event that Par\u0000cipant is not an employee of the Company or Subsidiary, the Restricted Stock Units grant will not be interpreted to form an\nemployment contract or rela\u0000onship with the Company or Subsidiary; and furthermore, the Restricted Stock Units grant will not be interpreted\nto form an employment contract with any other Subsidiary.\nk. The future value of the underlying Shares is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty. If the underlying Shares do not\nincrease in value, the Restricted Stock Units will have no value. If Par\u0000cipant obtains Shares a\u0000er ves\u0000ng of Restricted Stock Units, the value of\nthose Shares acquired may increase or decrease in value.\n7\nl. No claim or en\u0000tlement to compensa\u0000on or damages arises from termina\u0000on of the Restricted Stock Units or diminu\u0000on in value of the\nRestricted Stock Units or Shares granted a\u0000er the Restricted Stock Units ves\u0000ng resul\u0000ng from termina\u0000on of Par\u0000cipant’s service (for any\nreason whether or not in breach of local law) and Par\u0000cipant irrevocably releases the Company and each other Subsidiary from any such claim\nthat may arise. If, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is found by a court of competent jurisdic\u0000on to have arisen then, by signing this\nAgreement, Par\u0000cipant shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived Par\u0000cipant’s en\u0000tlement to pursue such a claim.\n10. Adjustments.\nThe terms of this Agreement, including, without limita\u0000on, the number of Shares underlying the Restricted Stock Units, will be subject to\nadjustment in accordance with Sec\u0000on 11 of the Plan.\n11. Securi\u0000es Laws; Coopera\u0000on.\nUpon the ves\u0000ng of any unvested Restricted Stock Units, Par\u0000cipant will make or enter into such wri\u0000en representa\u0000ons, warran\u0000es and\nagreements as the Commi\u0000ee may reasonably request in order to comply with applicable securi\u0000es laws, the Plan or this Agreement. Par\u0000cipant further\nagrees to cooperate with the Company in taking any ac\u0000on reasonably necessary or advisable to consummate the transac\u0000ons contemplated by this\nAgreement.\n12. No\u0000ces.\nAny no\u0000ce necessary under this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company in care of its Secretary at the principal execu\u0000ve office of the\nCompany and to Par\u0000cipant at the address appearing in the personnel records of the Company for such Par\u0000cipant or to either party at such other\naddress as either party hereto may herea\u0000er designate in wri\u0000ng to the other. Any such no\u0000ce shall be deemed effec\u0000ve upon receipt thereof by the\naddressee.\n13. Governing Law; Venue; Jury Trial Waiver; Language.\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made\nand performed wholly within the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. For purposes of li\u0000ga\u0000ng any dispute\nthat may arise directly or indirectly from this Agreement, the par\u0000es hereto hereby submit and consent to the exclusive jurisdic\u0000on of the State of\nCalifornia and agree that any such li\u0000ga\u0000on shall be conducted only in the courts of California or the federal courts of the United States located in\nCalifornia and no other courts. Each of Par\u0000cipant, the Company and any transferees who hold a por\u0000on of the RSU Award pursuant to a valid\nassignment hereby irrevocably waives any right to a jury trial. If Par\u0000cipant has received a copy of this Agreement (or the Plan or any other document\nrelated hereto or thereto) translated into a language other than English, such translated copy is qualified in its en\u0000rety by reference to the English\nversion thereof, and in the event of any conflict the English version will govern. Par\u0000cipant acknowledges that Par\u0000cipant is sufficiently proficient in\nEnglish to understand the terms and condi\u0000ons of this Agreement.\n14. Severability.\nShould any provision of this Agreement be held by a court of competent jurisdic\u0000on to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining\nprovisions of this Agreement will not be affected by such holding and will con\u0000nue in full force in accordance with their terms.\n15. Successors in Interest.\nAny successor to the Company will have the benefits of the Company under, and be en\u0000tled to enforce, this Agreement. Likewise, Par\u0000cipant’s\nlegal representa\u0000ve will have the benefits of Par\u0000cipant under, and be en\u0000tled to\n8\nenforce, this Agreement. All obliga\u0000ons imposed upon Par\u0000cipant and all rights granted to the Company under this Agreement will be final, binding and\nconclusive upon Par\u0000cipant’s heirs, executors, administrators and successors.\n16. Data Privacy Acknowledgement.\nThe following provisions shall only apply to Par\u0000cipant if he or she resides outside of the US, the EU, EEA, and the UK:\na. Par\u0000cipant voluntarily consents to the collec\u0000on, use, disclosure and transfer to the United States and other jurisdic\u0000ons, in electronic or\nanother form, of his or her personal data as described in this Agreement and any other award materials (“Data”) by and among, as applicable,\nthe Company Group for the exclusive purpose of implemen\u0000ng, administering, and managing his or her par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan. If Par\u0000cipant\ndoes not choose to par\u0000cipate in the Plan, his or her employment status or service with the Company Group will not be adversely affected.\nb. Par\u0000cipant understands that the Company Group may collect, maintain, process and disclose, certain personal informa\u0000on about him or her,\nincluding, but not limited to, his or her name, home address, email address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number,\npassport or another iden\u0000fica\u0000on number, salary, na\u0000onality, job \u0000tle, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all equity\nawards or any other en\u0000tlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in his or her favor, for the exclusive\npurpose of implemen\u0000ng, administering and, managing the Plan.\nc. Par\u0000cipant understands that Data will be transferred to one or more service provider(s) selected by the Company, which may assist the\nCompany with the implementa\u0000on, administra\u0000on, and management of the Plan. Par\u0000cipant understands that the recipients of the Data may be\nlocated in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the United States) may have different, including less stringent,\ndata privacy laws and protec\u0000ons than his or her country. Par\u0000cipant understands that if he or she resides outside the United States, he or she\nmay request a list with the names and addresses of any poten\u0000al recipients of the Data by contac\u0000ng his or her local human resources\nrepresenta\u0000ve. Par\u0000cipant authorizes the Company and any other possible recipients that may assist the Company (presently or in the future)\nwith implemen\u0000ng, administering, and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or another form,\nfor the sole purpose of implemen\u0000ng, administering and managing his or her par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan.\nd. Par\u0000cipant understands that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage his or her par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the\nPlan, including to maintain records regarding par\u0000cipa\u0000on.

Further, Par\u0000cipant understands that he or she is\nproviding these consents on a purely voluntary basis. If Par\u0000cipant does not consent or if he or she later seeks to revoke his or her consent, his\nor her engagement as a service provider with the Company Group will not be adversely affected; the only consequence of refusing or\nwithdrawing his or her consent is that the Company will not be able to grant him or her Restricted Stock Units under the Plan or administer or\nmaintain Restricted Stock Units. Therefore, Par\u0000cipant understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect his or her ability\nto par\u0000cipate in the Plan (including the right to retain the Restricted Stock Units). Par\u0000cipant understands that he or she may contact his or her\nlocal human resources representa\u0000ve for more informa\u0000on on the consequences of his or her refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent.\nThe following provisions shall only apply to Par\u0000cipant if he or she resides in the EU or EEA, the UK, or EU privacy laws are otherwise applicable:\n9\ne.

Par\u0000cipant understands that the Data will be transferred to and among the Company Group, as well as service\nproviders (such as stock administra\u0000on providers, brokers, transfer agents, accoun\u0000ng firms, payroll processing firms or tax firms), for the\npurposes explained above, which are necessary to allow the Company to perform this Agreement. Par\u0000cipant understands that the recipients of\nthe Data may be located in the United States and in other jurisdic\u0000ons outside of the European Economic Area where the Company Group or its\nservice providers have opera\u0000ons. The United States and some of these other jurisdic\u0000ons have not been found by the European Commission to\nhave adequate data protec\u0000on safeguards. If the Company Group makes transfers of Data outside of the European Economic Area, those\ntransfers will be made solely to the extent necessary to perform this Agreement and take necessary ac\u0000ons in connec\u0000on with such\nperformance. In addi\u0000on, service providers may commit to providing adequate safeguards for the transferred Data, such as the EU-U.S. Data\nPrivacy Framework or standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. In that case, Par\u0000cipant may obtain details of the\ntransfers by contac\u0000ng gc@10xgenomics.com.\ng. Par\u0000cipant’s Rights in Respect of Data.

Further, subject to applicable law, and\nunder certain circumstances, Par\u0000cipant may be en\u0000tled to the following rights in regard to his or her Data: (i) to object to the processing of\nData; (ii) to have his or her Data erased, such as where it is no longer necessary in rela\u0000on to the purposes for which it was processed; (iii) to\nrestrict the processing of his or her Data so that it is stored but not ac\u0000vely processed (e.g., while the Company assesses whether Par\u0000cipant is\nen\u0000tled to have Data erased); and (iv) to port a copy of the Data provided pursuant to this Agreement or generated by him or her, in a common\nmachine-readable format. To exercise his or her rights, Par\u0000cipant may contact gc@10xgenomics.com.

The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon\nthe express assump\u0000on and condi\u0000on that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Subsidiary, over and above the specific\nterms of the Plan. Consequently, Par\u0000cipant understands that the Restricted Stock Units are granted on the assump\u0000on and condi\u0000on that the\nRestricted Stock Units and any Shares acquired upon ves\u0000ng of the Restricted Stock Units are not part of any employment contract (either with the\nCompany or any Subsidiary) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensa\u0000on) or any other\nright whatsoever.

The thresholds for foreign asset/account repor\u0000ng are subject to change. Therefore,\nPar\u0000cipant shall consult his or her personal advisor in this regard.\nForeign Currency Payments.\nWhen receiving foreign currency payments exceeding €50,000 derived from the ownership of Shares (i.e., dividends or proceeds from the sale of the\nShares), Par\u0000cipant must inform the financial ins\u0000tu\u0000on receiving the payment of the basis upon which such payment is made.

By electronically accep\u0000ng this 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Subscrip\u0000on Agreement (this “Subscrip\u0000on Agreement”) and the Appendix\nto this Subscrip\u0000on Agreement, I hereby elect to par\u0000cipate in the Plan and subscribe to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock in\naccordance with the terms of the Plan and this Subscrip\u0000on Agreement. If I reside outside of the United States, I acknowledge and agree that I\npar\u0000cipate in the Non-423 Component of the Plan.\n2.

I\nacknowledge that a lesser percentage of my Compensa\u0000on than indicated by me may be contributed if necessary to comply with applicable law\n(in par\u0000cular, applicable law related to minimum salary requirements).\n3. I understand that, if my payroll deduc\u0000ons under the Plan are made in any currency other than U.S. dollars, such payroll deduc\u0000ons will be\nconverted to U.S. dollars on or prior to Exercise Date using a prevailing exchange rate in effect at the \u0000me such conversion is performed, as\ndetermined by the Commi\u0000ee.

Payroll Deduc\u0000ons.\na. The following provisions shall only apply to me if I reside in the United States: I understand that the payroll deduc\u0000ons will be\naccumulated for the purchase of shares of Class A Common Stock at the applicable Purchase Price for each Purchase Period ending\nduring the Offering Period determined in accordance with the Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and\nnotwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that my accumulated payroll deduc\u0000ons would result in my ability to\npurchase more than 2,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during any Offering Period (the “Offering Period Maximum”), I understand\nand agree that I will only be permi\u0000ed to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Offering Period Maximum,\nand that any excess payroll deduc\u0000ons remaining a\u0000er such purchase will be returned to me as soon as prac\u0000cable following the\nexpira\u0000on of such Offering Period.\nb.

I understand that if I do not withdraw from an Offering Period, any\naccumulated payroll deduc\u0000ons will be used to automa\u0000cally exercise the Purchase Right (as defined below) and purchase shares of\nClass A Common Stock under the Plan on the Exercise Date for each Purchase Period ending during the Offering Period. Notwithstanding\nthe\n1\nforegoing, and notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent that my accumulated payroll deduc\u0000ons would result\nin my ability to purchase more than 2,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during any Offering Period (the “Offering Period Maximum”),\nI understand and agree that I will only be permi\u0000ed to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the Offering\nPeriod Maximum, and that any excess payroll deduc\u0000ons remaining a\u0000er such purchase will be returned to me as soon as prac\u0000cable\nfollowing the expira\u0000on of such Offering Period.\nRegardless of any ac\u0000on the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary takes with respect to any or all income tax, social\ninsurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan and legally applicable to me\n(“Tax-Related Items”), I acknowledge that the ul\u0000mate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains my responsibility and may exceed\nthe amount actually withheld by the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary. I further acknowledge that the Company or, if\napplicable, any Parent or Subsidiary (1) makes no representa\u0000ons or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in\nconnec\u0000on with any aspect of the Purchase Right (as defined below) to purchase a number of shares of Class A Common Stock\ndetermined by dividing such Eligible Employee’s Contribu\u0000ons accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible\nEmployee’s account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price (the “Purchase Right”), including, but not limited to, the\ngrant or exercise of the Purchase Right, purchase of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the Purchase Right, the\nsubsequent sale of shares of Class A Common Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends and/or any\ndividend equivalents; and (2) does not commit to and are under no obliga\u0000on to structure the terms of the Purchase Right or any aspect\nof the Purchase Right to reduce or eliminate the my liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any par\u0000cular tax result. Further, if I am\nsubject to tax in more than one jurisdic\u0000on, I acknowledge that the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary may be required\nto withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdic\u0000on.\nPrior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, I will pay or make adequate arrangements sa\u0000sfactory to the\nCompany or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary to sa\u0000sfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, I authorize the Company or, if\napplicable, any Parent or Subsidiary, or their respec\u0000ve agents, at their discre\u0000on, to sa\u0000sfy their withholding obliga\u0000ons with regard to\nall Tax-Related Items by one or a combina\u0000on of the following:\n(i) withholding from my wages or other cash compensa\u0000on paid to me by the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary;\n(ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock acquired upon exercise of the Purchase Right either\nthrough a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on my behalf pursuant to this authoriza\u0000on\nwithout further consent); or\n(iii) withholding in shares of Class A Common Stock to be purchased upon exercise of the Purchase Right.\nDepending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable\nminimum statutory withholding rates or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case I will\nreceive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no en\u0000tlement to the shares of Class A Common Stock equivalent. If\nthe obliga\u0000on for Tax-Related Items is sa\u0000sfied by withholding in shares of Class A Common Stock, for tax purposes, I am deemed to\nhave purchased the full number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the Purchase Right, notwithstanding that a number of the\nshares of Class A Common Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the\npar\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan. Finally, I must pay to the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary any amount of Tax-Related Items\nthat the Company or, if applicable, any Parent or Subsidiary may be required to withhold or account for as a result of my\n2\npar\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan that cannot be sa\u0000sfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to sell or deliver the\nshares of Class A Common Stock or the proceeds of the sale of shares of Class A Common Stock, if I fail to comply with my obliga\u0000ons in\nconnec\u0000on with the Tax-Related Items.\n5. I have received a copy of the complete Plan and its accompanying prospectus. I understand that my par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan is in all respects\nsubject to the terms of the Plan, including this Subscrip\u0000on Agreement. Any conflict between this Subscrip\u0000on Agreement and the Plan will be\nresolved in favor of the Plan. The Company reserves the right to modify the Plan and to impose other requirements on my par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the\nPlan, on the op\u0000on and on any shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or\nadvisable for legal or administra\u0000ve reasons. I agree to be bound by such modifica\u0000ons regardless of whether no\u0000ce is given to me of such\nevent, subject, in any case, to my right to withdraw from par\u0000cipa\u0000on in the Plan. I further agree to sign any addi\u0000onal agreements or\nundertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.\n6. I understand that if I sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of Class A Common Stock received by me pursuant to an Offering within two (2)\nyears a\u0000er the applicable Enrollment Date (generally the first Trading Day of the applicable Offering Period) or one (1) year a\u0000er the applicable\nExercise Date (generally the last Trading Day of the applicable Purchase Period), I will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having\nreceived ordinary income at the \u0000me of such disposi\u0000on in an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of the shares of Class A\nCommon Stock at the \u0000me such shares of Class A Common Stock were purchased by me over the Purchase Price.

The Company may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from my compensa\u0000on the amount necessary to meet any applicable\nwithholding obliga\u0000on including any withholding necessary to make available to the Company any tax deduc\u0000ons or benefits a\u0000ributable to the\nsale or early disposi\u0000on of shares of Class A Common Stock by me. If I dispose of such shares of Class A Common Stock at any \u0000me a\u0000er the\nexpira\u0000on of the two (2)-year and one (1)-year holding periods described above, I understand that I will be treated for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes as having received income only at the \u0000me of such disposi\u0000on, and that such income will be taxed as ordinary income only to the\nextent of an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the date of\nthe disposi\u0000on exceeds the Purchase Price paid for the shares of Class A Common Stock (generally 85% of the Fair Market Value of the shares of\nClass A Common Stock on the Enrollment Date or on the Exercise Date, whichever is lower), or (b) 15% of the Fair Market Value of the shares of\nClass A Common Stock on the Enrollment Date. The remainder of the gain, if any, recognized on such disposi\u0000on will be taxed as capital gain.\n7.
