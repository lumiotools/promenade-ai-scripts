(Nasdaq: MASS), a pioneer of purpose-built handheld and desktop devices for chemical analysis, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“While we are pleased that our revenue increased year-over-year due to our newly acquired products, our third quarter results fell short of our expectations due to challenges from the delayed FY24 federal budget, delays with advancing international contracts, and ongoing softness in the bioprocessing and life science instrumentation market,” said Kevin J. Knopp, CEO and Co-founder. “Despite near-term headwinds, we see several growth drivers emerging that should propel us to the next level of scale, efficiency, and growth.” \n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue of $16.8 million for the third quarter 2024, increasing 17% compared to the third quarter 2023 \n    * Handheld revenue was $14.0 million, increasing 19% year over year \n    * Desktop revenue was $2.8 million, increasing 8% year over year \n    * Recurring revenue was $6.1 million, increasing 70% year over year \n    * 36% of revenue was recurring revenue, driven by service \n    * Core revenue declined 5% year over year excluding newly acquired FTIR products \n  * Used $5.7 million in cash in the quarter, ending the quarter with $71.7 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \n  * Continued traction with multiple enterprise orders in the US and internationally, including the largest order to date placed in APAC, comprised of MX908 devices for the Vietnam Border Guard \n  * Shipped 100 th unit of XplorIR handheld gas detector, more than doubling placements YTD from all of 2023 \n  * Increased cumulative installed base to 3,253 devices, up 20% from the end of the third quarter 2023 \n  * Completed expansion of facility in Danbury, CT, creating a lower-cost footprint for production and R&D of handheld devices \n  * Received Fast Company’s Best Workplaces for Innovation award and R&D 100 award for our MAVERICK bioprocessing device \n\n\n\n**Structural Adjustments and Growth Initiatives**\n\n“Reflecting on our first six months of ownership of RedWave Technology and observing shifts across our markets, it’s increasingly clear that a unified platform enables us to increase cost efficiency and expand gross margins across our entire product lineup. To fully capture this value, we’re implementing three structural changes,” said Kevin J. Knopp, CEO and Co-founder. “These adjustments empower us to navigate a slower growth period and seize immediate opportunities while laying the groundwork for accelerated future growth. We remain well-resourced heading into 2025, which we believe will be a transformative year for us.” \n\n**These changes consist of:**\n\n  * Transitioning manufacturing operations from Boston into North Carolina and Connecticut, to be completed in 2025, creating an opportunity for margin expansion \n  * Rationalizing bioprocessing and life science instrumentation investments by completing a reduction in force in November of approximately 11% to reduce operating expenses across sales, marketing and research and development \n  * Integrating and catalyzing our full sales organization for new efficiency, focus, and flexibility to quickly take advantage of growth opportunities \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue was $16.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a 17% increase over the prior year period. This was primarily driven by an increase in handheld devices revenue offset by a decrease in desktop devices revenue. The installed base grew 20% year-over-year to 3,253 devices with 178 handheld devices and 8 desktop devices placed during the third quarter 2024. Recurring revenue represented 36% of total revenues in the quarter. \n\nGross profit was $8.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.9 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. Gross margin was 50% as compared to 55% for the corresponding prior year period. Adjusted gross profit was $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $8.1 million for the corresponding period in the prior year. Adjusted gross margin was 55% as compared to 57% for the corresponding prior year period. For the first nine months of 2024, adjusted gross margin was 56% as compared to 52% for the prior year period. \n\nOperating expenses were $38.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $17.0 million for the corresponding prior year period. This increase was driven by a $30.5 million charge for an impairment of goodwill, the inclusion of operating expenses related to our RedWave acquisition and stock-based compensation, offset in part by a $12.1 million credit for the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. \n\nNet loss was $29.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.1 million for the corresponding prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $6.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $5.7 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nConsumed $5.7 million in operating cash in the quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $71.7 million as of September 30, 2024 with no debt outstanding. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\n908 Devices now expects full year reported 2024 revenue to be in the range of $56 million to $58 million, representing 11% to 15% growth over full year 2023. This includes approximately $10 million of expected revenue from RedWave Technology, representing 8 months of ownership. \n\n**Webcast Information**\n\n908 Devices will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results before market open on Tuesday, November 12, 2024 at 5:30 am Pacific Time / 8:30 am Eastern Time. A webcast of the conference call can be accessed at [https://ir.908devices.com/news-events/events](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.908devices.com%2Fnews-events%2Fevents&esheet=54150597&newsitemid=20241112074859&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.908devices.com%2Fnews-events%2Fevents&index=1&md5=e5bcc5f752141a472e67da2645e476af).

The Company’s devices are used at the point-of-need to interrogate unknown and invisible materials and provide quick, actionable answers to directly address some of the most critical problems in forensics, bioprocessing, pharma / biopharma, life sciences research and adjacent markets. The Company is headquartered in the heart of Boston, where it designs and manufactures innovative products that bring together the power of complementary analytical technologies, microfluidic sampling and separations, software automation, and machine learning. \n\n**Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance**\n\nTo supplement the Company’s financial statements, which are presented on the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the following non-GAAP measures of financial performance are included in this release and presented with detailed reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial results in the tables below: \n\n  * Adjusted Gross Profit is defined as gross profit excluding intangible amortization, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (including the costs of severance), and non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation. \n  * Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding other income, benefit for income taxes, depreciation, intangible amortization, acquisition and integration costs, restructuring charges (including the costs of severance), non-cash expenses related to stock-based compensation, and costs associated with contingent consideration related to the Company’s acquisitions and for which the conditions for payment have not yet been achieved. \n\n\n\nThe Company’s non-GAAP financial results presented in this earnings release exclude certain costs that management believes do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the performance of ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are recorded, nor do the resulting charges recorded accurately reflect the anticipated cash flows of ongoing operations, and as such, excluding these costs allows management to understand and evaluate core operating performance and trends. However, as there are no standardized methods of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures, the Company’s methods may differ from those used by other companies in its industry, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by others, thus limiting their usefulness for purposes of comparison. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures have certain limitations since they do not include the impact of certain expenses and cash flows that are reflected in the Company’s GAAP financial results. Accordingly, when analyzing the Company’s operating performance and guidance, investors should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in addition to and not in lieu of reported GAAP financial results, provide investors with additional meaningful information to assess financial performance and trends, enable comparison of financial results between periods, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics utilized internally in analyzing and operating the Company’s business. \n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company’s future revenue and growth. Words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend” and similar expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause actual results to differ materially from any results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement, including the risks outlined under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which are available on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotect.checkpoint.com%2Fv2%2F___http%3A%2Fwww.sec.gov___.YzJ1OmdpbG1hcnRpbmdyb3VwOmM6bzpkZmRjNzY1NDQzNWRmYjI2ZjVjMWNiM2YwYzg0MWM1ODo2Ojg1NDc6Y2RkZTgwYmI1YzM3MzMwMjEwN2JjYWZmOWRmYTlmYWY3MmU4M2VkYzFmNjZkN2U1OWNhMzEyMzMzMzkxNTc1MDpwOkY6Rg&esheet=54150597&newsitemid=20241112074859&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=2&md5=0398f85115eeb0445ee2c20aa0124817).

(Nasdaq: MASS), a pioneer of purpose-built handheld and desktop devices for chemical analysis, has appointed Michele M. Leonhart, the former Administrator of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to serve on its Board of Directors effective immediately. \n\nMs. Leonhart brings a deep understanding of our customers in law enforcement and adjacent markets. Her 34-year career in the DEA encompassed various positions with increasing levels of responsibility, including Special Agent in Charge of the Los Angeles Field Division from 1998 to 2003, Deputy Administrator (nominated by President Bush) from 2003 to 2007, Acting Administrator from 2007 to 2010, and Administrator (nominated by President Obama) from 2010 to 2015. As the highest-ranking executive in the DEA from 2007 to 2015, Ms. Leonhart was responsible for leading the $2.4 billion global drug enforcement, intelligence, laboratory, administrative, and regulatory operations of the agency’s 227 domestic and 86 foreign offices and directed day-to-day operations and oversight of over 9,000 employees. Ms. Leonhart retired from the DEA in 2015 and has served on the Board of Directors of the non-profit D.A.R.E America / D.A.R.E. International since 2015, and as its Board Chair since 2018. \n\n“I am delighted to welcome Michele to 908 Devices’ Board of Directors,” said Kevin Hrusovsky, Chairman of 908 Devices. “Michele brings extensive government knowledge and experience on drug interdiction, from local to federal levels, and importantly, is a passionate advocate for the prevention of substance abuse in children and young adults.” \n\n“I am honored to join the Board of Directors for 908 Devices,” said Ms. Leonhart. “I look forward to working with the Company’s talented leadership team as they further their efforts in providing law enforcement personnel with devices that rapidly identify illicit drugs to keep our communities safe.” \n\n“I am very excited to have Michele join us at this juncture in our company’s growth,” said Kevin J. Knopp, CEO and co-founder of 908 Devices. “We recently expanded our forensics technology portfolio with the acquisition of RedWave Technology, and Michele’s wealth of experience will support our efforts to further penetrate the forensics market.” \n\n**About 908 Devices**\n\n908 Devices Inc.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business\nstrategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements, and are made under the safe harbor\nprovisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, or the Exchange Act. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,”\n“should,” “could,” “target,” “predict,” “seek” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have\nbased these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends\nthat we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short- and long-term business operations\nand objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions, including those referenced in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nMoreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment and new risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible\nfor our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor,\nor combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we\nmay make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or\nimplied in the forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made only as of the date of this report. You\nshould not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected\nin the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or\nevents and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other\nperson assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements.

DEVICES INC.\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation\n908 Devices Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 10, 2012. The Company is a\ncommercial-stage technology company providing a suite of purpose-built handheld and desktop devices used at the point-of-need for\nchemical and biochemical analysis in a broad array of markets including life sciences research, bioprocessing, pharma/biopharma,\nforensics and adjacent markets.\nThe Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to technology companies in the device industry and of similar size,\nincluding, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel,\nprotection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, and the\nneed to obtain additional financing to fund operations. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, without limitation, uncertainties\nregarding rising inflation and higher interest rates. Products currently under development will require additional research and\ndevelopment efforts prior to commercialization and will require additional capital and adequate personnel and infrastructure. The\nCompany’s research and development may not be successfully completed, adequate protection for the Company’s technology may\nnot be obtained, the Company may not obtain necessary government regulatory approval, and approved products may not prove\ncommercially viable. The Company operates in an environment of rapid change in technology and competition.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nThe Company acquired CAM2 Technologies, LLC (d/b/a RedWave Technology) (“RedWave”), located in Danbury, Connecticut\nin April 2024. RedWave is a leading provider of portable FTIR spectroscopic analyzers for rapid chemical identification of bulk\nmaterials. FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared), an optical spectroscopy technology, is highly regarded for its specific substance\nidentification abilities across a broad range of bulk materials. This acquisition provides the Company with an expanded portfolio of\nhandheld chemical analysis devices for forensic workflows that quickly detect and identify unknown solids, liquids, vapors, and\naerosols at the point of need. In addition, RedWave bolsters the Company’s desktop portfolio with a line of accessories for pharma\nProcess Analytical Technology (PAT) and industrial QC applications.

The Company has incurred\nrecurring losses since inception, including net losses of $52.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $36.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $223.4\nmillion. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. The Company expects that its cash\nand cash equivalents and revenue from product and service will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure\nrequirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company may\nseek additional funding through private or public equity financings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and\nmarketing, distribution or licensing arrangements. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all,\nand the Company may not be able to enter into collaborations or other arrangements. The terms of any financing may adversely\naffect the holdings or the rights of the Company's stockholders. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be\nforced to delay, reduce or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs, product expansion or commercialization\nefforts, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.\n2.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have\n9\nTable of Contents\nbeen prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim\nfinancial statements. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements\nprepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, these\ncondensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial\nstatements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 on file with the SEC. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2024 and results of\noperations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and statements of stockholders’ equity for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been\nmade. The Company’s results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results of operations that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024 or any other period.\n(cid:0)% (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nThe Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer\nto the authoritative GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nof the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”).\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, 908\nDevices Securities Corporation, RedWave, 908 Devices (Shanghai) Technology Co., Ltd. and 908 Devices GmbH.

Significant estimates and assumptions\nreflected in these condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition and accounts\nreceivable, the valuation of inventory, fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, estimated fair value used\nto record impairment charges related to goodwill, fair value of contingent consideration, and the valuation of stock-based awards.\nThe Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it\nbelieves to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the impact of inflation and changes in interest rates, there has been\nuncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. The Company is not aware of any specific event or\ncircumstance that would require further updates to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or\nliabilities as of the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These estimates may change, as new events\noccur and additional information is obtained. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates as there are changes in\ncircumstances, facts and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual results\nmay differ from those estimates or assumptions.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)L(cid:0)V (cid:0)N (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)L(cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)L(cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)I(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)X (cid:0)S (cid:0)S (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are\nmaintained in bank deposit accounts and money market funds that regularly exceed federally insured limits. The Company is\nexposed to credit risk on its cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the event of default by the financial institutions to the extent\naccount balances exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Company’s marketable\nsecurities are invested in U.S. treasury securities and as a result, the Company believes represent minimal credit risk.\nSignificant customers are those that accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue or accounts receivable. For the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, one customer represented 21% of total revenue. For the comparable three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, two customers represented 41% and 17% of total revenue, respectively. For the nine\n10\nTable of Contents\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, one customer represented 10% of total revenue. For the comparable nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, two customers represented 22% and 11% of total revenue. As of September 30, 2024, three customers\naccounted for 27%, 18% and 13% of gross accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 19% of gross\naccounts receivable.\nCertain of the components included in the Company’s products are obtained from a sole source, a single source or a limited\ngroup of suppliers. Although the Company seeks to reduce dependence on those limited sources of suppliers and manufacturers, the\npartial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or the requirement to establish a new supplier for the components, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows and damage its customer\nrelationships.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H\nAccounts receivable are presented net of an allowance for credit losses, which is an estimate of amounts that may not be\ncollectible. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and monitors economic conditions to identify facts\nand circumstances that may indicate its receivables are at risk of not being collected. The Company provides reserves against\naccounts receivable for estimated credit losses, if any, that may result from a customer’s inability to pay based on the composition of\nits accounts receivable, current economic conditions and historical credit loss activity, and relevant available forward-looking\ninformation. Amounts deemed uncollectible are charged or written-off against the reserve.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalances at beginning of period $ 585 $ 133 $ 395 $ 25\nCurrent period change for expected credit loss 22 — 212 108\nDeduction / recoveries collected (22) (16) (22) (16)\nBalances at end of period $ 585 $ 117 $ 585 $ 117\n(cid:0)) (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)9 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nCertain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be\nreceived for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair\nvalue are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are\nconsidered observable and the last is considered unobservable:\n● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 - Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or\nliabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the\nfair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.\nThe Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts\npayable, accrued expenses and contingent consideration. The Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities, consisting of\nmoney market funds (a Level 1 measurement) and U.S. treasury notes (a Level 2 measurement), are carried at fair value, determined\naccording to the fair value hierarchy described above (See Note 3, (cid:0)) (cid:0)D (cid:0)L(cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)9 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)H (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V ). The carrying values of the Company’s\naccounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets\nand liabilities. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt approximates its fair value (a Level 2 measurement) at each\nbalance sheet date due to its variable interest rate, which approximates a market interest rate. The Company’s contingent\nconsideration is measured at its fair value at each balance sheet date using unobservable inputs in the valuation methodology (a Level\n3 measurement).\n11\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nThe Company’s marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains\nand losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Premiums and\ndiscounts on marketable securities are amortized and accreted, respectively, to earliest call date and maturity, respectively, and\nincluded in interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen the fair value is below the amortized cost basis of a marketable security, an estimate of expected credit losses is made. The\ncredit-related impairment amount is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Credit losses are recognized through the\nuse of an allowance for credit losses account in the consolidated balance sheet and subsequent improvements in expected credit\nlosses are recognized as a reversal of an amount in the allowance account. If the Company has the intent to sell the security or it is\nmore likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, then the\nallowance for the credit loss is written-off and the excess of the amortized cost basis of the asset over its fair value is recorded in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. There were no credit losses recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany purchased a total of approximately $40.9 million of U.S. treasury securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand all marketable securities mature in one year or less.\n(cid:0)* (cid:0)R (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)L(cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or on an interim basis when events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, the Company must\nmake assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows, and other factors, to determine the fair value. If these estimates or their\nrelated assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges in the reporting period in\nwhich the impairment is determined.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment, in the fourth quarter of\nevery fiscal year. The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment\ntesting is necessary before performing the quantitative assessment. If as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-\nnot that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be required. The\nquantitative goodwill impairment test requires management to estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its\ncarrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over their estimated useful lives as follows:\nCustomer Relationships 8 years\nDeveloped Technology 15 years\nSoftware 3 years\nTrade Name 2 years\nThe Company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company\nestimates the future cash flows that are expected from the use of each asset group. Impairment losses are measured and recorded for\nthe excess of an asset's carrying value over its fair value. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company utilizes the\nvaluation technique or techniques deemed most appropriate based on the nature of the asset or asset group, which may include the\nuse of quoted market prices, prices for similar assets or other valuation techniques such as discounted future cash flows or earnings.\n12\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nThe Company recognizes revenue from sales to customers under ASC 606, (cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)X (cid:0)V (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(“ASC\n606”), by applying the following five steps: (1) identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer, (2) identification of the\nperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the\nperformance obligations in the contract and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nFor a contract with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each\nperformance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis using the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling price\nof each distinct product or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the price observed\nin standalone sales to customers; however, when prices in standalone sales are not available the Company may use third party pricing\nfor similar products or services or estimate the standalone selling price, which is set by management. Allocation of the transaction\nprice is determined at the contract’s inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\n(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nThe Company derives product and service revenue primarily from the sale of handheld and desktop products and related\nconsumables and services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products, consumables or services is transferred to\nthe Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those\nproducts, consumables or services (the transaction price). A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct\nproduct or service to a customer and is the unit of accounting under ASC 606. For devices and consumables sold by the Company,\ncontrol transfers to the customer at a point in time. To indicate the transfer of control, the Company must have a present right to\npayment, legal title must have passed to the customer, the customer must have the significant risks and rewards of ownership, and\nwhere acceptance is other than perfunctory, the customer must have accepted the product or service. The Company’s principal terms\nof sale are freight on board (“FOB”) shipping point, or equivalent, and, as such, the Company primarily transfers control and records\nrevenue for product sales upon shipment. Sales arrangements with delivery terms that are not FOB shipping point are not recognized\nupon shipment and the transfer of control for revenue recognition is evaluated based on the associated shipping terms and customer\nobligations. If a performance obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains to be fulfilled following shipment\n(typically installation or acceptance by the customer), revenue recognition for that performance obligation is deferred until such\ncommitments have been fulfilled. For extended warranty and support, control transfers to the customer over the term of the\narrangement. Revenue for extended warranty and support is recognized based upon the period of time elapsed under the arrangement\nas this period represents the transfer of benefits or services under the agreement.\nThe Company recognizes a receivable at the point in time at which it has an unconditional right to payment. Such receivables\nare not contract assets. Payment terms for customer orders, including for each of the Company’s primary performance obligations,\nare typically 30 to 90 days after the shipment or delivery of the product, and such payments typically do not include payments that\nare variable, dependent on specified factors or events. In limited circumstances, there exists a right of return for a product if agreed to\nby the Company. Revenue is only recognized for those goods that are not expected to be returned such that it is probable that there\nwill not be a significant reversal of cumulative revenue. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing\nthe work (e.g., extended warranty/service contracts), upon completion of the service or a mix of both. The Company does not enter\ninto significant financing agreements or other forms of variable consideration.\nContract assets arise from unbilled amounts in customer arrangements when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to\nthe customer and the Company’s right to payment is not only subject to the passage of time. The Company had no contract assets\nrelated to product or service revenue as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nContract liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which it has received\nconsideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. The Company has determined that its only contract liability related to\nproduct and service revenue is deferred revenue, which consists of customer deposits and upfront payments but that have not been\nrecognized as revenue. Amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within 12 months of the balance sheet date are\n13\nTable of Contents\nclassified as current deferred revenue and amounts expected to be recognized as revenue beyond 12 months of the balance sheet date\nare classified as noncurrent deferred revenue.\nThe following is a summary of the activity of the Company’s deferred revenue related to product and service revenue (in\nthousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBalances at beginning of period $ 19,200 $ 16,510\nRecognition of revenue included in balance at beginning of the period (7,562) (5,332)\nDeferred revenue acquired, net of revenue recognized 3,261 —\nRevenue deferred during the period, net of revenue recognized 9,987 8,714\nBalances at end of period $ 24,886 $ 19,892\nThe amount of deferred revenue equals the transaction price allocated to unfulfilled performance obligations for the period\npresented.

The fair values assigned, defined as\nthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between willing market\nparticipants, are based on estimates and assumptions determined by management. The excess consideration over the aggregate value\nof tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. These valuations require significant estimates\nand assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration earnouts using the Monte Carlo Simulation or probability\nweighted scenario depending on the nature of the contingent consideration and updates the fair value of the contingent consideration\nat each reporting period based on the estimated probability of achieving the earnout targets and applying a discount rate that captures\nthe risk associated with the expected contingent payments. To the extent that these estimates change in the future regarding the\nlikelihood of achieving these targets, the Company may need to record material adjustments to its accrued contingent consideration.\nSuch changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded as contingent consideration expense or income in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of certain identifiable intangible assets including customer\nrelationships and developed technology. This approach determines fair value by estimating after-tax cash flows attributable to these\nassets over their respective useful lives and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. The Company bases\nits assumptions on estimates of future cash flows, expected growth rates, expected trends in technology, probabilities of customer\nrenewals, etc. The Company bases the discount rates used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value\nof money and certain industry-specific risk factors. The Company believes the estimated purchased customer relationships,\ndeveloped technology, software and trade name amounts determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not\nexceed the amount a third-party would pay for the assets.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)O(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nThe Company qualifies as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and\nhas elected not to “opt out” of the extended transition related to complying with new or revised accounting standards, which means\nthat when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public and nonpublic companies, the Company will\nadopt the new or revised standard at the time nonpublic companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time\nthat the Company either (i) irrevocably elects to “opt out” of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualifies as an\nemerging growth company.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280). The accounting guidance requires the\nCompany to expand annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures\nabout significant segment expenses. For public entities, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early application is allowed. As\nthis accounting standard update impacts disclosures only, we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740).

There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 or 2023.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nU.S. Treasury securities were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, which\nrepresent a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nThe Company recognizes acquisition-related contingent consideration which represents the estimated fair value of future\npayments or issuance of the Company’s common stock to the former owners of an acquired entity as part of certain transactions.\nAcquisition-related contingent consideration is measured and reported at fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation method or\nprobability weighted scenario based on the unobservable inputs, which are significant to the fair value and classified with Level 3 of\nthe fair value hierarchy.\nFor the acquisition of TRACE Analytics GmbH, located in Braunschweig, Germany (“Trace”) in August 2022, the amount is\ncontingent based on the acquired business’ performance for the milestones ranging from the date of acquisition to June 30, 2024. The\nunobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements include the probabilities of successful achievement of certain technological\nintegration targets, forecasted results or targets, volatility of the common stock price of the Company, and discount rates. The sellers\nin the Trace acquisition achieved two of three milestones under the share purchase and transfer agreement, and accordingly the\nCompany paid the sellers $0.5 million in August 2023 and $0.5 million in February 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the\nprobability weighted fair value of the remaining future earnout related to the Trace acquisition was determined to be zero and the\naccumulated accretion under the last milestone and the relative contingent consideration have been reduced to zero. During the\nsecond quarter of 2024, the sellers did not meet the last milestone and the measurement period for the milestone ended on June 30,\n2024.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFor the acquisition of RedWave in April 2024, the amount of contingent consideration to be issued is contingent based on the\namount of revenue the Company generates from the sale of certain RedWave products and services during the two-year period from\nMay 1, 2024 through April 30, 2026. As of the acquisition date of RedWave, the fair value of the contingent consideration was\nestimated using a Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market\nof $5.76 per share, revenue projections, an equity volatility rate of the Company of 90%, a revenue volatility rate of 30% and a\ndiscount rate of 26.5%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated utilizing the closing price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market of $3.47 per share, revenue projections, an equity volatility rate of the\nCompany of 75%, a revenue volatility rate of 26% and a discount rate of 19%. The fair value of contingent consideration decreased\nby $12.1 million, primarily due to the change in revenue projections from operating decisions made post-acquisition and sustained\ndecreases in the Company’s publicly quoted share price during the third quarter of 2024. The following table provides a roll-forward\nof the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration, for which fair value is determined using Level 3 inputs (in thousands):\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 500\nAcquisition date fair value of contingent consideration - earnout 15,500\nDecrease in fair value of contingent consideration earnouts (12,141)\nContingent consideration payment (500)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 3,359\nThe change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability is included in loss from operations.\n4. Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities by security type consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Credit\nCost Gain Loss Losses Fair Value\nMarketable securities - U.S. Treasury securities $ 26,623 $ 38 $ — $ — $ 26,661\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Credit\nCost Gain Loss Losses Fair Value\nMarketable securities - U.S. Treasury securities $ 24,628 $ 13 $ — $ — $ 24,641\nThe Company purchased a total of approximately $40.9 million of U.S. treasury securities for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024. The U.S. treasury securities that matured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately $39.0\nmillion and none were sold before maturity. Interest earned on sales of marketable securities is $1.2 million and $0.1 million for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\n5. Inventory\nInventory consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials $ 11,500 $ 11,294\nWork-in-progress 1,894 1,717\nFinished goods 4,439 1,927\n$ 17,833 $ 14,938\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made noncash transfers of demonstration equipment\nfrom inventory to property and equipment of $1.0 million and $0.3 million, respectively.\n6. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill\nAs of September 30, 2024, the carrying amount of goodwill was $10.1 million. The following is a roll forward of the Company’s\ngoodwill balance (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nBalances at beginning of period $ 10,367 $ 10,050\nGoodwill acquired 30,160 —\nGoodwill impairment (30,523) —\nForeign currency impact 133 (122)\nBalances at end of period $ 10,137 $ 9,928\nThe Company evaluates goodwill at least annually on November 1, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances\nsuggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nAs a result of sustained decreases in the Company’s publicly quoted share price and market capitalization during the third\nquarter of 2024, the Company determined that there was a triggering event for its goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets, and other\nlong-lived assets as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company assessed the definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment by comparing the\nundiscounted cash flows for each of these assets to their respective carrying value. The undiscounted cash flows for each of these\nassets was in excess of their respective carrying value and, as a result, the Company concluded that there was no impairment for\nthese assets. The significant estimates used in fair value methodology, which are based on Level 3 inputs, include the Company's\nexpectations for future operations and projected cash flows, including revenue, gross margin and operating expenses.\nIn performing the quantitative assessment of goodwill, the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeded its fair value. The\nCompany estimated the reporting unit's fair value based on the market capitalization and a related control premium of 20%\n(reflecting the amount that would be paid by a new controlling shareholder for the benefits resulting from synergies and other\npotential benefits derived from controlling the acquired company). The Company evaluated the implied control premium by\ncomparing it to control premiums or discounts of recent comparable market transactions, as applicable. As a result of the interim\nquantitative impairment assessment, the Company recorded a $30.5 million noncash goodwill impairment charge for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. When considering a hypothetical sensitivity analysis to our goodwill assessment in future\nperiods, should a triggering event be identified, a further 5% decline in our stock price with all other inputs being equal could result\nin an impairment charge of approximately $7 million.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets, net consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAccumulated Translation\nCost Amortization adjustments Net Book Value\nCustomer Relationships $ 5,642 $ (1,025) $ 269 $ 4,886\nDeveloped Technology 43,047 (1,811) 454 41,690\nSoftware 254 (166) 19 107\nTrade Name 61 (61) — —\n$ 49,004 $ (3,063) $ 742 $ 46,683\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccumulated Translation\nCost Amortization adjustments Net Book Value\nCustomer Relationships $ 3,142 $ (580) $ 240 $ 2,802\nDeveloped Technology 4,967 (487) 395 4,875\nSoftware 254 (108) 18 164\nTrade Name 61 (45) 3 19\n$ 8,424 $ (1,220) $ 656 $ 7,860\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was recorded in the following expense categories of its condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct cost of revenue $ 743 $ 108 $ 1,380 $ 321\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 187 113 463 337\n$ 930 $ 221 $ 1,843 $ 658\nEstimated future amortization expense for the intangible assets as of September 30, 2024 are as following (in thousands):\n2024 $ 928\n2025 3,710\n2026 3,641\n2027 3,632\n2028 3,632\nThereafter 31,140\n$ 46,683\n7.

The Company was permitted to make interest-\nonly payments on the revolving line of credit through November 2, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness would be\nimmediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance accrued interest at a floating rate per annum equal to\nthe greater of (i) three and one-half percent (3.50%) and (ii) the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal for the relevant\nperiod minus one-half percent (0.50%). The Company’s obligations under the 2022 Revolver were secured by substantially all of the\nCompany’s assets, excluding its intellectual property, which was subject to a negative pledge. The revolving line of credit under the\n2022 Revolver was scheduled to terminate on November 2, 2025.\nThe 2022 Revolver also contained certain financial covenants, including a requirement that the amount of unrestricted and\nunencumbered cash minus advances under the 2022 Revolver, was not less than the amount equal to the greater of (i) $10.0 million\nor (ii) nine (9) months of cash burn. The 2022 Revolver contained customary representations and warranties, as well as certain non-\nfinancial covenants, including limitations on, among other things, the Company’s ability to change the principal nature of its\nbusiness, dispose of the Company’s business or property, engage in any change of control transaction, merge or consolidate with any\nother entity or to acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness or liens,\npay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock, redeem the Company’s capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates\nor otherwise encumber the Company’s intellectual property, in each case, subject to customary exceptions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal balance under the 2022 Revolver was $15.0 million, which was repaid in\nfull on January 4, 2023.\nOn March 10, 2023, SVB, one of our financial institutions, was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and\nInnovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver.\nOn March 12, 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board, and FDIC released a joint statement\nannouncing that the FDIC would complete its resolution of SVB in a manner that fully protected all depositors and that depositors\nwould have access to all of their money starting March 13, 2023.\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all its cash and cash equivalents away from SVB and\ndeposited the funds with new financial institutions. As a result of the transfer of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities, the Company was in default of its financial covenants under the 2022 Revolver. The Company recorded a loss\non extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was included in interest expense in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 4, 2023, the Company entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the\n“Amended 2022 Revolver”), by and between, the Company, as borrower, and SVB, as lender.

The vesting of the\nshares underlying the Market Condition Based PSUs is subject to the achievement of stock price levels pre-established by the\ncompensation committee of the Company’s board of directors at the grant date. The Market Condition Based PSUs are subject to the\nmarket and service conditions and valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which requires certain assumptions, including the\nrisk-free interest rate, expected volatility, and the estimated dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate used in the Monte Carlo\nsimulation model is based on zero-coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the performance\nperiod on the market condition based PSUs. The performance period of the Market Condition Based PSUs represents the period of\ntime between the grant date and the end of the performance period. Expected volatility is based on historical data of the peers and\ncertain indices over the most recent time period equal to the performance period.\nIn May 2024, 52,084 performance-based restricted stock units, (“Performance Condition Based PSUs”) were granted under the\n2020 Plan to employees. Each Performance Condition Based PSU is equivalent in value to one share of the Company’s common\nstock and related to revenue targets for the period up to April 2026.\nThe maximum payout percentage for all performance-based restricted stock units, including Market Condition Based PSUs and\nPerformance Condition Based PSUs, granted by the Company is 100%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Market Condition\nBased PSUs and Performance Condition Based PSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.\n11. Leases\nThe Company’s primary operating lease obligations consists of various leases for office space in Massachusetts, Connecticut,\nNorth Carolina and Braunschweig, Germany.\nIn April 2024, the Company acquired an operating lease agreement (the “Danbury Lease”) in Danbury, Connecticut as a part of\nthe acquisition of RedWave. The Company entered into an amendment in June 2024 to the Danbury Lease (the “Amended Danbury\nLease”). Under the Amended Danbury Lease, the Company included an additional 9,000 square feet, representing its currently\noccupied space on the first floor, for a total of approximately 38,000 square feet and extended the\n23\nTable of Contents\nterm of the Danbury Lease for a new ten-year term. The Amended Danbury Lease is accounted for as a lease modification, which\nresulted in two new separate operating leases which are the original lease space (the “first floor lease”) and the expanded space (the\n“third floor lease”). The lease term of the first floor lease commenced in June 2024, which was the point at which the Company\nobtained control of the leased premises. On the commencement date of the first floor lease, the Company recorded a right-of-use\nasset and lease liability of $0.6 million, respectively, and is accounted for as an operating lease.

The purchase price included an initial payment of $45.0 million in cash and 1,497,171 unregistered\nshares of the Company’s common stock, which reflects closing adjustments relating to working capital, cash and debt adjustments.\nThe cash consideration is subject to additional working capital, cash, debt, and transaction expense adjustments. Approximately $4.5\nmillion of the cash consideration was placed into an indemnification escrow account until April 29, 2025 to settle certain claims for\nindemnification for breaches or inaccuracies in RedWave’s representations and warranties, covenants, and agreements.

Under this method, the value of an asset is a function of several components,\nincluding the forecasted revenue, earnings generated by the asset, expected economic life of the asset, contributory asset charges and\na discount rate. The fair value of the customer relationships was calculated using a distributor method, a form of the income\napproach, which incorporates a variation of the multi-period excess earnings method that uses market-based inputs to value an asset.\nUnder this method, the value of the asset is a function of several components, including revenue associated with the existing\ncustomers, distributor profit margin, charges for use of other assts and discount rate. Intangible assets acquired have finite life and\nare amortized per our accounting policy. See Note 2 for the amortization periods.\nThe results of RedWave’s operations have been included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements since\nthe date of the acquisition. RedWave contributed $6.3 million in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany has not disclosed RedWave’s net income or loss since the acquisition date because the RedWave business is fully\nintegrated into the condensed consolidated Company’s operations and therefore it was impracticable to determine these amounts.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings which may result from the\nconsolidation of the operations of the Company and RedWave.

Subsequent events\nIn November 2024, the Company announced an organizational restructuring to strengthen operational efficiencies. As part of\nthe organizational restructuring, and to reduce the Company’s annual cash burn, the Company implemented an approximately 11%\nworkforce reduction to rationalize the Company’s bioprocessing and life science instrumentation investments in sales, marketing and\nresearch and development during the current slower growth market environment. In addition, the Company is transitioning\nmanufacturing operations from Boston into North Carolina and Connecticut, to be completed in 2025.

Our devices are used at the point-of-need to interrogate unknown and invisible materials and provide quick,\nactionable answers to directly address some of the most critical problems in forensics, bioprocessing, pharma/biopharma, life science\nresearch and adjacent markets.\nWe create simplified measurement devices that our customers can use as accurate tools where and when their work needs to be\ndone, rather than overly complex and centralized analytical instrumentation. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide\nwill accelerate workflows, reduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users.\nFront-line workers rely upon our handheld devices to combat the opioid crisis and detect counterfeit pharmaceuticals and illicit\nmaterials in the air or on surfaces at levels 1,000 times below their lethal dose. First responders also utilize our handheld devices to\ndetect and identify thousands of hazardous bulk materials. Our desktop devices are accelerating development and production of\nbiotherapeutics by identifying and quantifying extracellular species in bioprocessing critical to cell health and productivity. They sit\nalongside or are directly connected to bioreactors and fermenters producing drug candidates, functional proteins, cell and gene\ntherapies, and synthetic biology derived products. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide accelerate workflows,\nreduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users. The term “products” as used in this “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” refers to the MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, XplorIR,\nRebel, ZipChip Interface, Maverick, Maven and related sampling devices.\nOn April 29, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with CAM2\nTechnologies, LLC (d/b/a RedWave Technology) (“RedWave”), CAM3 HoldCo, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company\n(“Seller Entity”), each of the holders of outstanding equity interests of Seller Entity (the “Beneficial Sellers”), and the other parties\nthereto, pursuant to which the Company purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of RedWave, and the transaction closed on\nthe same day. The purchase price included an initial payment of $45.0 million in cash and 1,497,171 unregistered shares of the\nCompany’s common stock, which reflects closing adjustments relating to working capital, cash and debt adjustments. The cash\nconsideration is subject to additional working capital, cash, debt, and transaction expense adjustments. RedWave is a leading\nprovider of portable FTIR spectroscopic analyzers for rapid chemical identification of bulk materials. FTIR (Fourier Transform\nInfrared), an optical spectroscopy technology, is highly regarded for its specific substance identification abilities across a broad range\nof bulk materials. This acquisition provides the Company with an expanded portfolio of handheld chemical analysis devices for\nforensic workflows that quickly detect and identify unknown solids, liquids, vapors, and aerosols at the point of need. In addition,\nRedWave bolsters the Company’s desktop portfolio with a line of accessories for pharma Process Analytical Technology (PAT) and\nindustrial QC applications.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve\nprofitability will depend on the successful further development and commercialization of our products. We generated revenue of\n$40.8 million and $35.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and incurred net losses of\n$52.8 million and $29.0 million for those same periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $223.4 million.\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses as we focus on growing sales of our products in both the United States and international\nmarkets, including expanding our sales teams as we grow, scaling our manufacturing operations,\n29\nTable of Contents\ncontinuing research and development efforts to develop new products and further enhance our existing products. Further, we expect\nto incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. As a result, we may need additional funding for expenses\nrelated to our operating activities, including selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to\naccurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue sufficient to achieve profitability, we expect to finance our operations\nthrough a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and strategic alliances. We may be unable to raise additional funds or\nenter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital or enter\ninto such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the further development\nand commercialization efforts of one or more of our products, or may be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and revenue from product and service will enable us to fund our\noperating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next 12 months. We have based this\nestimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect.\nSee “(cid:0)/ (cid:0)L(cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)V .”\n(cid:0)* (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)E (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V\nWe are continuing to closely monitor macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, continued inflationary and interest\nrate pressures, challenging capital market conditions and the limited availability of financing alternatives, which may have an impact\non our business, results of operations and financial results.\nWe are closely monitoring continued economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad, including volatility in the global\nmarkets and the rise and fluctuations in inflation and interest rates. These developments and the potential worsening of other macro-\neconomic conditions present risks for us, and our suppliers and customers. For example, general inflation in the United States,\nEMEA and other geographies has recently been at levels not experienced in recent decades, which has led to higher prices for our\nraw materials and other inputs, as well as higher salaries and travel expenses, which could continue to negatively impact our business\nby increasing our cost of sales and operating expenses. General inflation could also negatively impact our business if it leads to\nspending pressure and decreased available capital for our customers to deploy to purchase our products and services.\nIn addition, while the United States Federal Reserve has recently begun to lower interest rates, it has over the past couple of\nyears raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Inflation, together with increased interest\nrates, may cause our customers to reduce or delay orders for our goods and services thereby causing a decrease in or change in\ntiming of sales of our products and services. The impact of future inflation and interest rate fluctuations on the results of our\noperations cannot be accurately predicted.\nChallenging capital market conditions and the limited availability of financing alternatives, together with inflationary and\ninterest rates pressures, may contribute to more cautious spending by our customers. Certain of our pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology customers, including bioprocessing customers, may evaluate their inventory levels, cash on hand and path to\nprofitability, and institute cost controls and take other actions to reduce or delay purchases of our products and services. We cannot\naccurately predict the full impact of current macroeconomic factors on the budgets and capital expenditures of our customers, or the\ntiming of the normalization of customer purchasing patterns.\nWe are closely monitoring the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing hostilities in Israel,\nLebanon, and the Gaza Strip and other locations in the Middle East. Although we do not directly source any material products or\nsupplies from Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Lebanon or the Gaza Strip, our customers in Europe and the Middle East could be impacted by\nextended conflicts or an escalation of these conflicts into neighboring countries.\nWhile it is difficult to predict all of the impacts these global economic events and continued inflationary and interest rate\npressures will have on our business and to predict the effects of these factors on our customers’ spending in the near term, we believe\nthe long-term opportunity that we see for our products and services remain unchanged.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFor further discussion of the possible impacts of these global factors and other risks on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk\nFactors,” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our financial performance has been and in the foreseeable future will continue to be primarily driven by the\nfollowing factors. While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges\nthat we must successfully address to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations. Our ability to successfully address the\nfactors below is subject to various risks and uncertainties.\n(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)V (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nOur financial performance has largely been driven by, and in the future will continue to be impacted by, the rate of sales of our\nhandheld and desktop devices. Management focuses on device sales as an indicator of current business success and a leading\nindicator of likely future recurring revenue from consumables and services. We expect our device sales to continue to grow as we\nincrease penetration in our existing markets and expand into, or offer new features and solutions that appeal to, new markets.\nWe plan to grow our device sales in the coming years through multiple strategies including expanding our sales efforts\ndomestically and globally and continuing to enhance the underlying technology and applications for bioprocessing and life sciences\nresearch related to our Maverick, Rebel, ZipChip Interface, and Maven and related sampling devices. We regularly solicit feedback\nfrom our customers and focus our research and development efforts on enhancing our devices and enabling our customers to use\nadditional applications that address their needs, which we believe in turn helps to drive additional sales of our devices and\nconsumables.\nOur sales process varies considerably depending upon the type of customer to whom we are selling. Our handheld device orders\nrelate to our MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR, as well as components for the Aerosol and Vapor Chemical Agent Detectors\n(“AVCAD”) sold to our channel partner. Historically, our handheld devices have been used by municipal, state, federal and foreign\ngovernments and governmental agencies. Our sales process with government customers is often long and involves multiple levels of\napprovals, testing and, in some cases, trials. Device orders from a government customer are typically large orders and can be\nimpacted by the timing of their capital budgets. As a result, the revenue for our handheld devices can vary significantly from period-\nto-period and has been and may continue to be concentrated in a small number of customers in any given period.\nOur desktop devices are typically used by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academia markets. Our sales cycles within\nthese markets tend to vary based on the size of the customer and the number of devices they purchase. Our shortest sales cycles are\ntypically for small laboratories and individual researchers where, in some cases, we receive purchase orders from these customers\nwithin three months. Our sales process with other institutions can be longer with most customers submitting purchase orders within\nsix to twelve months. Given the variability of our sales cycle, we have in the past experienced, and likely will in the future\nexperience, fluctuations in our desktop device sales on a period-to-period basis.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nWe regularly assess trends relating to recurring revenue which includes consumables, accessories and services based on our\nproduct offerings, our customer base and our understanding of how our customers use our products. Recurring revenue was 39% and\n33% of total product and service revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our recurring\nrevenue as a percentage of total product and service revenue will vary based upon new device placements in the period. As our\ndevice installed base expands, recurring revenue on an absolute basis is expected to increase and over time should be an increasingly\nimportant contributor to our revenue.\nRevenue from the sales of consumables will vary by type of device. We expect that recurring revenue as a percentage of the\noriginal device price to be higher for our desktop devices (Rebel, ZipChip Interface, Maverick, Maven and related sampling devices)\nthan for our handheld devices (MX908, ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR). While we sell single-use swab samplers for MX908 to be\nused in liquid and solid materials analysis, there are a number of other applications that the MX908 can be used for that do not\nrequire consumables. ThreatID, ProtectIR, and XplorIR do not have consumables. Rebel and ZipChip\n31\nTable of Contents\nInterface require consumables kits for all areas of operations. Currently, Rebel customers, who are actively utilizing the device, are\nconsuming on average approximately half a 200-sample kit per month; however, Rebel is a relatively new product and purchasing\npatterns related to our consumables kits are evolving. We expect that the number of kits sold per month will vary over the short term.\nIn time, we expect Rebel consumables kits sales to become more consistent as our installed base grows and our customers establish\nusage patterns. At maximum potential capacity, with continuous operation, the Rebel can consume approximately one 200-sample kit\nper day. Maverick devices require consumables, probes and standards for all areas of operations. Maven and related sampling devices\nrequire consumable sets of buffers, probes and biosensors for all areas of operations.\n(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)[ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)J (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)J (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q\nOur revenue is derived from sales of our devices, consumables, accessories and services. There will be fluctuations in mix\nbetween devices and recurring from period-to-period. Over time, as our device installed base grows and we see adoption of Rebel,\nwe expect consumables revenue to constitute a larger percentage of product and service revenue. However, the percentage will be\nsubject to fluctuation based upon our handheld sales in a period. In addition, our selling price and, consequently, our margins, are\nhigher for those devices and recurring revenue that we sell directly to customers as compared to those that we sell through channel\npartners. While we expect the mix of direct sales as compared to sales through channel partners to remain relatively constant in the\nnear term, we are currently evaluating increasing our direct sales capabilities in certain geographies.\nFuture device and recurring selling prices and gross margins may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including the introduction\nby others of competing products and solutions. We aim to mitigate downward pressure on our average selling prices by increasing\nthe value proposition offered by our devices and consumables and accessories, primarily by expanding the applications for our\ndevices and increasing the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained using our consumables.\n(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)G (cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q\nWe monitor our customers’ stages of adoption of our products to provide insight into the timing of future potential sales and to\nhelp us formulate financial projections. Typical stages of adoption include testing, trials, pilot and deployment as follows:\n● Testing - a customer is actively engaged with internal or external testing of our products. This may include an onsite\nor virtual demonstration with a salesperson, a customer submitting samples for testing in one of our facilities or\ntesting by a third party.\n● Trials - a customer has committed to a trial of one of our products, which may include a defined period to assess\nfunctionality of the device in their operational environment (in the field or onsite within the customer’s facility).\n● Pilot - a customer commits to the purchase of an initial quantity of devices to deploy in their operational environment\nto assess a broader opportunity that may grow to tens or hundreds of devices.\n● Deployment - a customer has completed testing, a trial, and/or a pilot and intends to roll out the technology across\ntheir enterprise (either at a site or throughout the entire organization).\nKey Business Metrics\nWe regularly review the number of product placements and cumulative product placement as key metrics to evaluate our\nbusiness, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections, and make strategic\ndecisions. We believe that these metrics are representative of our current business; however, we anticipate these will change or may\nbe substituted for additional or different metrics as our business grows.\n32\nTable of Contents\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our product placements (units recognized as revenue) were as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProduct Placements:\nHandheld 178 117 374 286\nDesktop 8 7 26 38\nThe number of product placements vary considerably from period-to-period due to the type and size of our customers and\nconcentrations among larger government customers as described above.

Device sales accounted for 61% and 67% of our product and service revenue for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recurring revenue accounted for 39% and 33% of our product and service revenue for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur current device offerings include:\n● Handheld devices— MX908 ThreatID, ProtectIR, XplorIR and AVCAD components; and\n● Desktop devices—Rebel and ZipChip Interface, Maverick, and Maven and related sampling devices.\nWe sell our devices directly to customers and through channel partners. Each of our device sales drives various streams of\nrecurring revenue comprised of consumable and accessory product sales and service revenue.\nOur consumables consist of:\n● MX908—accessories and swabs;\n● Rebel—consumables kit with a microfluidic chip and standards;\n● ZipChip Interface—microfluidic chip, reagent and assay kits;\n● Maverick—calibration kits and accessories; and\n● Maven and related sampling devices—probes, tubing sets and accessories.\nRebel and ZipChip Interface consumables can only be used with our devices and there are no alternative after-market options\nthat can be used as a substitute. Each chip is used for a defined number of samples (or runs). We recognize revenue from the sale of\nconsumables as the consumable products are shipped.\nWe also offer our customers extended warranty and service plans. Our extended warranty and service plans are offered for\nperiods beyond the standard one-year warranty that all of our customers receive. These extended warranty and service plans\n33\nTable of Contents\ngenerally have fixed fees and terms ranging from one additional year to four additional years. We recognize revenue from the sale of\nextended warranty and service plans over the respective coverage period, which approximates the service effort provided by us.\nWe expect consumables and service revenue to increase in future periods as our installed base grows and we are able to generate\nrecurring sales.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nContract agreements are arrangements whereby we provide engineering services for the development of our technology platform\nfor specific programs or new and expanding applications of our technologies for future commercial endeavors.

Gross profit margin is gross profit expressed as a percentage of\nrevenue. Our gross profit in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, including: market conditions that may impact our\npricing, sales mix among devices, sales mix changes among consumables, excess and obsolete inventories, our cost structure for\nmanufacturing operations relative to volume, and product warranty obligations. Our gross profit in future periods will vary based\nupon our channel mix and may decrease based upon our distribution channels and the potential to establish original equipment\nmanufacturing channels for certain components of our technology platform which would have a lower gross margin.\nWe expect that our gross profit margin for product and service will increase over the long term as our sales and production\nvolumes increase and our cost per unit decreases due to efficiencies of scale. We intend to use our design, engineering and\nmanufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing, which we believe will reduce costs\nand increase our gross margin.

To date, we have funded our operations primarily with\nproceeds from sales of redeemable preferred stock, borrowings under loan agreements and revenue from sales of our products and\nservices and contract revenue, proceeds from our initial public offering in December 2020, and with proceeds from an underwritten\npublic offering in November 2021. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.7\nmillion. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses,\ncapital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least the next twelve months.\nWe have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources\nsooner than we expect. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n● market uptake of our products and growth into new and existing markets;\n● the cost of our research and development efforts to expand the applications of our current devices and to create enhanced\nproducts with our platform of technologies;\n● the cost of expanding our commercial operations, including distribution capabilities, and accelerating planned investments,\nsuch as hiring additional support, service, and sales management in Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, bolstering our\ninfrastructure in these regions;\n● the cost of acquiring complementary businesses, products, services or technologies, when and if required;\n44\nTable of Contents\n● the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to enter additional collaborations in the future;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n● the level of our selling, general and administrative expenses.\nOn November 2, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the 2022 Revolver, with Silicon Valley Bank, or the\nLender.\nThe 2022 Revolver provided for a revolving line of credit of up to $35.0 million. We were permitted to make interest-only\npayments on the revolving line of credit through November 2, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness would be\nimmediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance accrued interest at a floating rate per annum equal to\nthe greater of (i) three and one-half percent (3.50%) and (ii) the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal for the relevant\nperiod minus one-half percent (0.50%). Our obligations under the 2022 Revolver were secured by substantially all of our assets,\nexcluding our intellectual property, which was subject to a negative pledge. The revolving line of credit under the 2022 Revolver was\nscheduled to terminate on November 2, 2025.\nThe 2022 Revolver also contained certain financial covenants, including a requirement that the amount of unrestricted and\nunencumbered cash minus advances under the 2022 Revolver was not less than the amount equal to the greater of (i) $10.0 million or\n(ii) nine (9) months of cash burn. The 2022 Revolver contained customary representations and warranties, as well as certain non-\nfinancial covenants, including limitations on, among other things, our ability to change the principal nature of our business, dispose\nof our business or property, engage in any change of control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or to acquire all\nor substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness or liens, pay dividends or make other\ndistributions on capital stock, redeem our capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates or otherwise encumber our intellectual\nproperty, in each case, subject to customary exceptions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no balances outstanding under the 2022 Revolver. As of December 31, 2022, the\noutstanding principal balance under the 2022 Revolver was $15.0 million, which was repaid in full on January 4, 2023. The interest\nrate applicable to borrowing under the 2022 Revolver was 7.0% as of December 31, 2022.\nOn March 10, 2023, the Lender, also one of our financial institutions, was closed by the California Department of Financial\nProtection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, as receiver.\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities away\nfrom the Lender and deposited the funds with new financial institutions. As a result of the transfer of the Company’s cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities, the Company was in default, of its financial covenants under the 2022 Revolver. The\nCompany recorded a loss on extinguishment of $0.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2023, which was included in\ninterest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 4, 2023, we entered into a Default Waiver and First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement with the Lender, or\nthe Amended 2022 Revolver, in which the Lender waived its rights and remedies against the Company and amended the 2022\nRevolver. The Amended 2022 Revolver provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $10.0 million. The Company is permitted to\nmake interest-only payments on the revolving line of credit through November 3, 2025, at which time all outstanding indebtedness\nshall be immediately due and payable. The outstanding principal amount of any advance shall accrue interest at a floating rate per\nannum equal to the greater of (i) four and one-half percent (4.50%) and (ii) the “prime rate” as published in The Wall Street Journal\nfor the relevant period minus one-half percent (0.50%). The Company’s obligations under the Amended 2022 Revolver are secured\nby substantially all of the Company’s assets, excluding its intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge. The revolving\nline of credit under the Amended 2022 Revolver terminates on November 3, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, there were no balances\noutstanding under the Amended 2022 Revolver.\nPursuant to the Amended 2022 Revolver, the Lender waived filing any legal action or instituting or enforcing any rights and\nremedies it may have had against the Company in connection with the Company’s failing to maintain all of its operating accounts,\ndepository accounts and excess cash with the Lender, as previously required under the 2022 Revolver.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on\nacceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience\ndilution. Future debt financing, if available, may involve covenants, in addition to our existing covenants, restricting our operations\nor our ability to incur additional debt or potentially limiting our ability to obtain new debt financing or the refinance of our existing\ndebt. Any debt or equity financing that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise\nadditional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to\nour technologies or our products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not have or are not able to obtain\nsufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products.

The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to\nmake estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience,\nknown trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nFor a further discussion of our critical accounting policies, please refer to Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Report on Form 10-K. There were no significant\nchanges to our critical accounting policies for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of\noperations is disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q and is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 3.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in\nRules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls\nand procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a\ncompany in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures,\nno matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management\nnecessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the\nevaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures\nwere effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired RedWave Technology on April 29, 2024.

As this acquisition occurred in\nthe second quarter of 2024, the scope of our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting does not include RedWave\nTechnology. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC’s general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may\nbe omitted from the scope of our assessment in the year such business is acquired.\nOther than the foregoing, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently\ncompleted fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

          "content": "Analysis at the\nspeed of life\nNOVEMBER 2024\nForward looking statements / Non-GAAP financial measures\nThis presentation and the accompanying oral presentation (this “presentation”) contain forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of\nSection 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements may relate to, but are not limited to, expectations of future\nresults of operations or financial performance of 908 Devices Inc. (“908 Devices,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or similar terms), market size and growth opportunities, the\ncalculation of certain of our key financial and operating metrics, capital expenditures, plans for future operations, technological capabilities, and strategic relationships, as well as\nassumptions relating to the foregoing. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and you should not put undue reliance on\nany forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made and/or management’s good faith beliefs and assumptions as of that time\nwith respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by\nthe forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include our ability to achieve profitability for any period in the future; our expectations regarding our operating\nresults, our addressable market, market growth, trends, future revenue, key performance indicators, expenses, capital requirements and our needs for additional financing; our\nability to hire and retain key personnel, including sales and marketing personnel, and to manage our future growth effectively; competitive companies and technologies and our\nindustry; our ability to establish and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and workflows or avoid or defend claims of infringement; the severity and impact\nof COVID-19 and actions taken in response to it; the potential effects of government regulation; and other risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. These factors and others could cause actual results, performance or achievement to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-\nlooking statements. Except as required by law, 908 Devices does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of\nnew information, future developments or otherwise.\nThis presentation contains statistical data, estimates and forecasts that are based on independent industry publications or other publicly available information, as well as other\ninformation based on our internal sources. This information involves many assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to these estimates. We\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in these industry publications and other publicly available information. Accordingly, we make\nno representations as to the accuracy or completeness of that data nor do we undertake to update such data after the date of this presentation.\nIn addition, projections, assumptions, and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the markets in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high\ndegree of uncertainty and risk.\nLastly, this presentation incudes certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), including adjusted gross margin\npercentage and adjusted EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to and not a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations\nto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found inthis presentation.\n2\nOUR MISSION\nVALIDATED BROAD CUSTOMER BASE STRONG\nTECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND GLOBAL PRESENCE FINANCIAL PROFILE\nWe make chemical\n3,200+ 15,000+ $55M\nanalysis simple,\nUnits Sold Trained Users Revenue LTM as of Sept 30th\nsmart, and speedy\n850+ 55+ $72M\nAccounts Countries Cash as of Sept 30th\nOUR VISION\nTo empower\npeople to take\nswift action in\nlife-altering\napplications\n3\nProven Track Record\nAWARDS\n2024\nwith Strong Momentum\nAcquires\nRedWave\n2023\nTechnology\nADDING 3\nHANDHE L D\n2022 Launches P RODU C TS\nAcquires\nTRACE Launches\n2020\nAnalytics\nGmbH\nInitial Public\nOffering TE C HNOL OGY\n2019 AC QU ISITION\nStock: MASS\nNASDAQ\n2017 Launches\n2016 Launches\n2012 Launches\n2023 Analytics\n908 Devices\nSolution Provider\nisfounded\nofthe Year\nin Boston\n4\nCompleted Acquisition (4/29/24)\nHigher Growth, Improved Margins, Faster Path to Profitability\nAcquired high growth & profitable RedWave Technology\nFY23: Revenues of $13.8M (20%+ YoY) at 53% GMs and +15% operating margin\nExpansion of 908’s Forensics toolbox\nProduct suite now includes market leading, complementary handheld technologies for high-\nfidelity trace detection and expansive bulk unknown identification\nImmediate plug-in for 908’s direct sales & apps team\n908 bolsters RedWave growth trajectory with robust commercial platform and global reach\nComplementary tech to support Bioprocess applications\nFTIR technology is complementary to MAVERICK device and used in QA/QC and pharma PAT\nMore MASS: Accelerates topline growth and profitability\nSales leverage and forecasted annual cost synergies are projected to accelerate cash-flow\nbreakeven with improved long-term profit potential.\n5\nAddressing the Challenges of Chemical Analysis\nChallenge 908 Devices Solutions\nSlow Turn-Around-Time – Our devices provide ‘answers’ in seconds to minutes.\nlong lab wait times limit utility No waiting days or weeks for central lab results.
