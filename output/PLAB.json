          "content": "In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in the Company's most recent Form 10-K, the following\nare important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those\ncontained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe text set forth below is an excerpt from the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company on\nDecember 17, 2021 for its fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and has not been updated for any\nsubsequent events. Any cross reference or defined terms used in the text below are to corresponding\nsections or definitions, in the Form 10-K.\nConcentration Related Risk Factors\nOur dependency on the microelectronics industry, which as a whole is volatile, could create volatility\nin our demand and have a negative material impact on our business.\nWe sell substantially all of our photomasks to semiconductor or FPD designers, manufacturers and\nfoundries, as well as to other high-performance electronics manufacturers. We believe that the demand\nfor photomasks depends primarily on design activity rather than sales volume from products using\nphotomask technologies. Consequently, an increase in semiconductor or FPD sales does not necessarily\nresult in a corresponding increase in photomask sales. In addition, the reduced use of customized ICs, a\nreduction in design complexity, other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing or\ndesigning semiconductors or FPDs, or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor or FPD\ndesigns could reduce demand for photomasks ‒ even if the demand for semiconductors and FPDs\nincreases. Historically, the microelectronics industry has been volatile, with sharp periodic downturns\nand slowdowns. These negative trends have been characterized by, among other things, diminished\nproduct demand, excess production capacity, and accelerated erosion of selling prices with a\nconcomitant effect on revenue and profitability.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for equipment and raw materials and, if those suppliers\nfail to timely deliver their products to us, we may be unable to fulfill orders from our customers,\nwhich could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of photomask equipment manufacturers to develop, supply, and repair the\nequipment we use. These equipment manufacturers usually require lead times of twelve months or\nlonger between the order date and the delivery of certain photomask imaging and inspection\nequipment. The failure of our suppliers to develop or deliver such equipment on a timely basis could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the manufacturing\nequipment necessary to produce advanced photomasks could become prohibitively expensive, which\ncould similarly affect us.\nWe use high-precision quartz photomask blanks, pellicles, and electronic grade chemicals in our\nmanufacturing processes. There are a limited number of suppliers of these raw materials, and we do not\nhave long-term contracts with these suppliers. Any delays or quality problems in connection with\nsignificant raw materials, particularly photomask blanks, could cause delays in the shipments of\nphotomasks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The\nfluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates, with respect to prices of equipment and raw materials\nused in manufacturing, could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe have been dependent on sales to a limited number of large customers; the loss of any of these\ncustomers or a significant reduction in orders from these customers could have a material adverse\neffect on our revenues and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have sold a significant proportion of photomasks to a limited number of IC and FPD\nmanufacturers. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, our two largest customers accounted for 29%, 29% and\n31%, respectively, of our revenue. Our five largest customers accounted for 43%, 45% and 46% of our\nrevenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loss of a significant customer, a significant reduction\nor delay in orders from any significant customer (including reductions or delays due to customer\ndepartures from recent buying patterns), or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions in the\nsemiconductor or FPD industries could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and\nbusiness prospects. The consolidation of semiconductor manufacturers, or an economic downturn in the\nsemiconductor industry, may increase the likelihood of losing a significant customer and could also have\nan adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.\nFinancing Related Risk Factors\nOur cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash may not be adequate for our current and\nlong-term needs.\nOur liquidity, as we operate in a high fixed-cost environment, is highly dependent on our revenue\nvolume and the timing of our capital expenditures, which can vary significantly from period to period.\nDepending on conditions in the semiconductor and FPD markets, our cash flows from operations and\ncurrent holdings of cash may not be adequate to meet our current and long-term needs for capital\nexpenditures, operations, and debt repayments. Historically, in certain years, we have used external\nfinancing to fund these needs. Due to conditions in the credit markets and covenant restrictions on our\nexisting debt, some financing instruments used by us in the past may not be available. Therefore, we\ncannot provide assurance that additional sources of financing would be available to us on commercially\nfavorable terms, if at all, should our cash requirements exceed our existing cash, operating cash flows,\nand cash available under our credit agreements.\nOur credit facility restricts our business activities, limits our ability to obtain additional financing or\npay cash dividends, and may obligate us to repay debt before its maturity.\nFinancial covenants related to our credit facility, which expires in September 2023, include a total\nleverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, and minimum unrestricted cash balances. Our credit\nfacility may also limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry,\nwhich may place us at a disadvantage with our competitors. We are also subject to covenants that limit\nour financing flexibility, such as a limit on the amount we can spend to repurchase shares of our\ncommon stock. Existing covenant restrictions, and noncompliance with covenants or cross-default\nprovisions could limit our ability to draw down on current facilities or our ability to obtain additional\ndebt financing, and limit the amounts of dividends, distributions, and redemptions we can pay on our\ncommon stock to an annual amount of $50 million. Should we be unable to meet one or more of these\ncovenants, our lenders may require us to repay any outstanding balance prior to the expiration date of\nour agreements. Our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants in our credit agreements\nmay be affected by deteriorating economic or business conditions, or other events. We cannot assure\nthat, under such circumstances, additional sources of financing would be available to fund operating\nrequirements or repay any long-term borrowings, to avoid default.\nOur operations will continue to require substantial capital expenditures, for which we may be unable\nto provide or obtain funding.\nThe manufacture of leading-edge photomasks requires us to make substantial investments in high-end\nmanufacturing capability. We expect that we will be required to continue to make substantial capital\nexpenditures to meet the technological demands of our customers and to position us for future growth.\nOur capital expenditure payments for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $100 million, of\nwhich approximately $9.7 million was included in Accounts payable and Accrued liabilities on our\nOctober 31, 2021, consolidated balance sheet. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to\nobtain the additional capital required to fund our operations or capital expenditures on reasonable\nterms, if at all, or that any such inability will not have a material adverse effect on our business and\nresults of operations.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not generate sufficient cash\nflows from our operations to pay our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of debt principal and interest, or to refinance our indebtedness,\ndepends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other\nfactors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flows from\noperations to fund operations, service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are\nunable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as\nselling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or\nhighly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness would depend upon the conditions in the\ncapital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these\nactivities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt\nobligations.\nIndustry and Competitive Related Risk Factors\nOur business depends on managerial and technical personnel, who are in great demand, and our\ninability to attract and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon key managerial and technical personnel, as well as our ability to\ncontinue to attract and retain additional qualified personnel. The loss of certain key personnel (for\nexample, our chief executive officer and chief technology officer) could have a material adverse effect\non our business and results of operations. We cannot offer assurance that we can retain our key\nmanagerial and technical employees, or that we can attract similar additional employees in the future.\nThe photomask industry is dependent on the semiconductor and display industries, which are subject\nto rapid technological change and fluctuations in capacity needs. Consequently, we might fail to\nadequately time our capabilities to market needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nThe photomask industry has been, and we expect it to continue to be, characterized by technological\nchange and evolving industry requirements, which recent supply chain regionalization efforts have\naccelerated. In order to remain competitive, we will be required to continually anticipate, respond to,\nand scale technologies of increasing complexity in both traditional and emerging markets that we serve.\nIn particular, we believe that, as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller and FPDs\nbecome larger or otherwise more advanced, we will be required to manufacture increasingly challenging\nphotomasks. Moreover, the demand for photomasks in non-leading-edge nodes may increase beyond\nour ability to meet our customers’ requirements within adequate response times. Additionally, the\ndemand for photomasks has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by changes in\nsemiconductor and high-performance electronics fabrication methods that affect the type or quantity of\nphotomasks utilized, such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field-programmable gate\narrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application-specific ICs. Furthermore, evidence of\nthe viability and the corresponding market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring IC designs\nonto semiconductor wafers could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks in the production of\nsemiconductors. As of the end of 2021, one alternative method, direct-write lithography, has not been\nproven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks, as it is considered to be too slow for\nhigh-volume semiconductor wafer production. However, should direct-write or any other alternative\nmethod of transferring IC or FPD designs without the use of photomasks achieve market acceptance,\nand if we are unable to anticipate, respond to, or utilize these or other technological changes, due to\nresource, technological, or other constraints, our business and results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected.\nThe risk of loss of our intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive business or customer\nconfidential information or disruption of operations due to cyberattacks or data breaches could\nnegatively impact our financial results.\nCyberattacks or data breaches could compromise confidential, business-critical information, cause\ndisruptions in our operations, expose us to potential litigation, or harm our reputation. We have\nimportant assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive, business-critical\nand/or confidential information which may be vulnerable to such incidents. While we have a\ncomprehensive cybersecurity program that is continually reviewed, maintained, and upgraded, we\ncannot assure that we are invulnerable to cyberattacks and data breaches which, if significant, could\nnegatively impact our business and financial results.\nWe may be unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of proprietary technology, and the\nutilization of unprotected company developed technology by our competitors could adversely affect\nour business, results of operations, and financial position.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends more on proprietary technology, information and\nprocesses, and know-how than on our patents or trademarks. Much of our proprietary information and\ntechnology related to manufacturing processes is not patented and may not be patentable. We cannot\noffer assurance that:\n• We will be able to adequately protect our technology;\n• Competitors will not independently develop similar technology;\n• International intellectual property laws will adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe may become the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties with respect to\ncurrent or future products or processes. Any such claims, with or without merit, or litigation to enforce\nor protect our intellectual property rights that require us to defend against claimed infringements of the\nrights of others, could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, and product shipment delays or\ncould force us to enter into royalty or license agreements, rather than dispute the merits of these\nclaims. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\nand financial position.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and, should we be unable to meet our customers’\nrequirements for product quality, timeliness of delivery or technical capabilities, our revenue could be\nadversely affected.\nThe photomask industry is highly competitive, and most of our customers utilize more than one\nphotomask supplier. Our competitors include Compugraphics International, Ltd., Dai Nippon Printing\nCo., Ltd (outside of Taiwan and China), Hoya Corporation, LG Innotek Co., Ltd., Shenzhen New Way\nPhotomask Making Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Qingyi Photomask, Ltd., SK-Electronics Co. Ltd., Taiwan Mask\nCorporation, and Toppan Electronics Products Co., Ltd. We also compete with semiconductor and FPD\nmanufacturers' captive photomask manufacturing operations, some of which market their photomask\nmanufacturing services to outside customers. We expect to face continued competition from these and\nother suppliers in the future. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, sales,\nmarketing, or other resources than we do. Also, when producing smaller geometry photomasks, some of\nour competitors may be able to more rapidly develop and produce such masks and achieve higher\nmanufacturing yields than we can. We believe that consistency of product quality, timeliness of delivery,\ncompetitive pricing, technical capability and service are the principal factors considered by customers\nwhen selecting their photomask suppliers. Our inability to meet these competitive requirements could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In the past, competition has\nled to pressure to reduce prices and the need to invest in advanced manufacturing technology, which\nwe believe contributed to the decrease in the number of independent photomask suppliers. These\npressures may continue in the future.\nInvestment Related Risk Factors\nJoint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their\nobligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and compel us to dedicate additional\nresources to these joint ventures.\nThe nature of a joint venture requires us to share control in certain areas with unaffiliated third parties.\nIf our joint venture partner does not fulfill its obligations, the affected joint venture may not be able to\noperate in accordance with its business plan. Under such a scenario, our results of operations may be\nadversely affected, and we may be compelled to increase the level of our resources devoted to the joint\nventure. Also, differing views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, or\nfailures to agree on major issues. If such differences caused a joint venture to deviate from its business\nplan, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur expansion into China entails substantial risks.\nIn 2019, we commenced operations at our two newly constructed manufacturing facilities in China.\nThese investments are subject to substantial risks which may include, but are not limited to: the inability\nto protect our intellectual property rights under Chinese law, which may not offer as high a level of\nprotection as U.S. law; unexpectedly long negotiation periods with Chinese suppliers and customers;\nquality issues related to materials sourced from local vendors; limited access to electricity; unexpectedly\nhigh labor costs due to a tight labor supply; and difficulty in repatriating funds and selling or transferring\nassets. Our investments in China also exposed us to a significant additional foreign currency exchange\nrisk, which we had not been subject to in prior years. In addition, as tensions have, from time to time,\nescalated between the U.S. and China, we believe there is an enhanced risk that our substantial\ninvestments in China may be subject to unforeseen restrictions, which may include expropriation of the\ninvestments by the Chinese government. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return\non, or losing some, or all, of our investments in China, which would have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition and financial performance.\nWe may incur unforeseen charges related to possible future facility closures or restructurings.\nWe cannot provide assurance that there will not be facility closures or restructurings in the near or long\nterm, nor can we assure that we will not incur significant charges should there be any future facility\nclosures or restructurings.\nWe may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or joint ventures or integrate acquisitions into\nour business, which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses.\nAs part of our business growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in\nthe past, and we may pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future. Our future\nefforts to grow the Company may include expanding into new or related markets or industries. Our\nability to implement this component of our growth strategy may be limited by both our ability to\nidentify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources, including our\navailable cash and borrowing capacity. The expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering\ninto joint ventures, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition, or our failure to integrate businesses\nsuccessfully, could result in unanticipated expenses and losses. Furthermore, we may not be able to\nrealize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures.\nThe process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen\noperating difficulties, and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available\nfor the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Some of the risks associated with the\nintegration of acquisitions include: potential disruption of our ongoing business; distraction of\nmanagement; unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures;\nunforeseen adjustments, taxes, charges and write-offs; problems enforcing the indemnification\nobligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities; unexpected losses\nof customers of, or suppliers to, the acquired business; difficulty in conforming the acquired business’\nstandards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations; variability in financial performance\narising from the implementation of acquisition accounting; inability to coordinate new product and\nprocess development; loss of senior managers and other critical personnel; problems with new labor\nunions; and challenges arising from the increased scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our\noperations.\nOperations Related Risk Factors\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, and we anticipate that such\nfluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future. Fluctuations in operating results may result\nin volatility in the prices of our common stock and financial instruments linked to its value. Operating\nresults may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including the size and timing of orders and shipments,\nthe loss of significant customers, changes in product mix, the flow of customer design releases,\ntechnological change, fluctuations in manufacturing yields, the actions of our competitors, and general\neconomic conditions. We operate in a high fixed-cost environment and, should our revenues and asset\nutilization decrease, our operating margins could be negatively impacted.\nOur customers generally order photomasks on an as-needed basis; thus, our revenue in any quarter is\ndependent primarily on orders received during that quarter. Since we operate with little backlog, and\nthe rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, our capital expenditures and\nconsequential expense levels are, to some extent, based primarily on sales forecasts and technological\nadvancements in photomask manufacturing equipment. Consequently, if anticipated revenues in any\nquarter do not occur when expected, our capital investments could result in underutilized capacity and\ndisproportionately high expense levels, causing operating results to be adversely affected. Due to the\nforegoing factors, we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results cannot be\nrelied upon as indicators of future performance. In addition, in future quarters, our operating results\ncould be below guidance we may provide or the expectations of public market analysts and investors,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur substantial non-U.S. operations are subject to additional risks.\nRevenues from our non-U.S. operations were approximately 84%, 83% and 81% of our total revenues in\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that maintaining significant international operations\nrequires us to have, among other things, a local presence in the geographic markets that we supply. This\nrequires significant investments in financial, managerial, operational, and other resources. Since 1996,\nwe have significantly expanded our operations in international markets by acquiring existing businesses\nin Europe and Asia, and building manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and China. In order to enable us to\noptimize our investments and other resources, we closely monitor the semiconductor and FPD\nmanufacturing markets for indications of geographic movement and, in conjunction with these efforts,\ncontinue to assess the locations of our manufacturing facilities. These assessments may result in the\nopening or closing of facilities.\nOperations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including: fluctuations in currency\nexchange rates; unstable political and economic conditions in various countries; changes in economic\nalliances; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; compliance with a variety of burdensome\nforeign laws and regulations; compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (such as the Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act); tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in staffing and managing international\noperations; and longer accounts receivable collection cycles. In addition: foreign countries may enact\nother restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including: currency exchange controls; trade sanctions\nwhich result in our losing access to customers and suppliers; legislation which renders agreements to be\ndifficult to enforce; impositions on the movement of funds or other assets; or we may be subject to\nadverse tax consequences. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our costs or our ability\nto generate revenues outside of the United States and, consequently, on our business and results of\noperations.\nWe could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers, or lose\ncustomers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications.\nOur products provide important performance attributes to our customers’ products. If a product fails to\nperform in a manner consistent with quality specifications, or has a shorter useful life than warrantied, a\ncustomer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the\nproduct failing to perform, particularly if such products are sold under agreements that contain limited\nperformance and life cycle warranties. Our customers often require us to guarantee that our products\nconform to certain product specifications that they provide. Any failure to comply with such\nspecifications could result in claims or legal action. A successful claim, or series of claims, against us\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result\nin a loss of one or more customers.\nWe face risks associated with the use of sophisticated equipment and complex manufacturing\nprocesses and technologies. Our inability to effectively utilize such equipment and technologies and\nperform such processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of\noperations.\nOur complex manufacturing processes require the use of expensive and technologically sophisticated\nequipment and materials, and are continually modified in an effort to improve manufacturing yields and\nproduct quality. Minute impurities, defects, or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower\nmanufacturing yields and render products unmarketable. Moreover, the manufacture of leading-edge\nphotomasks is more complex and time consuming than manufacturing less advanced photomasks, and\ntheir fabrication may result in delays in the manufacture of all levels of photomasks. We have, on\noccasion, experienced manufacturing difficulties and capacity limitations that have delayed our ability to\ndeliver products within the time frames contracted for by our customers. We cannot provide assurance\nthat we will not experience these or other manufacturing difficulties, or be subject to increased costs,\nwhich could result in a loss of customers or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations.\nWe have a high level of fixed costs.\nBecause of the capital-intensive nature of the photomask manufacturing business, we have a high level\nof fixed costs and a high degree of operating leverage. Accordingly, should our sales volumes decline as\na result of a decrease in design releases from our customers or for any other reason, we may have\nexcess or underutilized production capacity which could significantly impact our operating margins or\nresult in write-offs from asset impairments.\nRegulatory Related Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 vaccination mandates could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain employees.\nIn response to COVID-19, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best\ninterest of our employees and which comply with government orders in all the states and countries\nwhere we operate. In an effort to keep our employees safe and to maintain operations during COVID-19,\nwe have implemented a number of new health-related measures including the requirement to wear\ncompany provided facemasks at all times while on company property, temperature taking protocols,\nincreased hygiene, cleaning and sanitizing procedures at all locations, social-distancing, restrictions on\nvisitors to our facilities, and limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings. Additionally, we are\nfollowing government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and for\nUS employees we required vaccinations against COVID-19. We may not be able to attract or retain\nemployees as a result of this mandate, and though we believe these actions are appropriate and\nprudent to safeguard our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers while allowing us to safely\ncontinue operations, we cannot predict how the steps we, our team members, government entities,\nsuppliers or customers take in response to COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business, outlook, or\nresults of operations.\nAdditional taxes could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur tax filings are subject to audits by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do\nbusiness. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with\nthe taxing authorities or through the courts. Currently, we believe there are no outstanding assessments\nwhose resolution would result in a material adverse financial result. However, we cannot offer\nassurances that unasserted or potential future assessments would not have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products and technology could be subject to and negatively impacted by the recent expansion of\nthe foreign-produced direct product rule.\nIn May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) amended\nexport administration regulations by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”) and certain\naffiliates to the “Entity List” for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of\nthe United States, imposing significant new restrictions on export, re-export and transfer of U.S.\nregulated technologies and products to Huawei. On August 17, 2020, BIS issued a final rule adding\nadditional Huawei non-U.S. affiliates to the Entity List, confirming the expiration of a temporary general\nlicense applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign-produced direct product rule in a manner that\nrepresents a significant expansion of its application to Huawei.\nExpansion of the foreign-produced direct product rule and additional companies being added to the\nentity list may adversely affect our business in various ways, including by: increasing the cost of\nregulatory compliance for the export of our products, equipment, services, and technology from the\nUnited States and abroad; increasing the time necessary to obtain required authorizations; increasing\nthe risk of monetary fines and other penalties for non-compliance, and negatively impacting our\ncustomers who may no longer be able to supply their customers and thereby reducing demand for their\nor our products. Any of these effects could result in lost revenue, additional product costs, increased\nlead times and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships.\nOur products and technology could be subject to U.S. export control laws and the export control laws\nof the foreign jurisdictions where we operate.\nWe are subject to various laws relating to the export of products we manufacture, and the technology\nrelated thereto, and our failure to comply with these laws could subject us to substantial fines,\npenalties, and even injunctions, the imposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the\nsuccess of our business.\nWe are subject to the export control laws of the United States and the export control laws of the foreign\njurisdictions where we operate. On April 28, 2020, the U.S. administration significantly expanded the\nreach of U.S. export controls over certain products and certain countries. The U.S. Department of\nCommerce has, among other things: expanded license requirements to China, Russia and Venezuela;\nbroadened the list of products covered by these expanded license requirements; expanded the\ndefinition of “military end use”; created a new “reason for control”; created a new review policy for\ncertain items to certain countries; added substantial electronic export information filing requirements;\neliminated the license exception for civil end use for certain countries, including China, Russia and\nVenezuela; and proposed to remove those same countries from the list of those eligible for additional\nre-exports license exceptions. The final rules relating to most of these changes were effective June 29,\n2020. Application of these laws may adversely affect our business in various ways, including by\nregulating the export of our products, equipment, services, and technology from the United States and\nabroad, increasing the time necessary to obtain required authorizations, and the possibility of monetary\nfines and other penalties for non-compliance.\nWe may be unprepared for changes to environmental laws and regulations and may incur liabilities\narising from environmental matters.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that impose various environmental\ncontrols on, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the handling,\nuse, storage, disposal, and cleanup of solid and hazardous wastes. Changes in these laws and regulations\nmay have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and inadequate\ncompliance with their requirements could give rise to significant liabilities.\nIf we violate environmental, health or safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct\nsuch violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, and substantial\nfines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities\nassociated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury,\nproperty damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such\nhazardous substances, may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or\nregulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party\nmay be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss). Such liabilities\nmay also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue,\nincluding, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous\nsubstances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected\nproperty, as well as entities that currently own or operate such property. The nature of our business,\nincluding historical operations at our current and former facilities, exposes us to risks of liability under\nthese laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that\ncan cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. Additional information\nmay arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites\nand additional sites that may be identified, for which we are alleged to be liable.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIneffective internal controls could impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their\ninherent limitations in detecting human errors, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud;\neven effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation\nand fair presentation of financial statements. If we: fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls; otherwise fail to\nprevent financial reporting misstatements; or experience difficulties in implementing internal controls,\nour business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting\nobligations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by global or regional catastrophic events.\nOur business could be adversely affected by terrorist acts, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases\n(such as COVID-19), government responses such as shelter-in-place directives to limit the impact of\ninfectious diseases, or the outbreak or escalation of wars, especially in the Asian markets in which we\ngenerate a significant portion of our sales and in Japan where we purchase raw materials and capital\nequipment. Such events in the geographic regions in which we do business, including escalations of\npolitical tensions and military conflicts within the Korean Peninsula, or between the People’s Republic of\nChina and the U.S. or the Republic of China (Taiwan), could have material adverse impacts on our\nrevenue, cost and availability of raw materials, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur production facilities could be damaged or disrupted by natural disasters or labor strikes, either of\nwhich could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA major catastrophe, such as an earthquake or other natural disaster, labor strike, or work stoppage at\nany of our manufacturing facilities, or a manufacturing facility of our suppliers or customers, could result\nin a prolonged interruption of our business. A disruption resulting from any one of these events could\ncause significant delays in shipments of our products and the loss of revenue and customers, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our\nfacilities in Taiwan are located in a seismically-active area.\nOur sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the U.S. or other countries in which we or our customers\nconduct business may have the effect of reducing the demand for photomasks. Economic downturns\nmay lead to a decrease in demand for end products whose manufacturing processes involve the use of\nphotomasks, which may result in a reduction in new product design and development by semiconductor\nor FPD manufacturers, and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store, and protect electronic\ninformation. For example, a significant portion of the communications between our personnel,\ncustomers, and suppliers depends on information technology. Our information technology systems may\nbe vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our control, including, but not limited\nto, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers, and\nother security issues. Although we have technology and information security processes and disaster\nrecovery plans in place to mitigate our risks to these vulnerabilities, these measures may not be\nadequate to ensure that our operations will not be disrupted, should such an event occur.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in the European Union (EU) on\nMay 25, 2018, applies to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally\nidentifiable information of residents of EU countries. The GDPR created a range of new compliance\nobligations and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. It is possible that the GDPR may be\ninterpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to, or unforeseen by us, including requirements that\nare inconsistent with our practices, or that we may otherwise fail to construe its requirements in ways\nthat are satisfactory to the EU authorities. Upon leaving the E.U. on January 31, 2021, the U.K. enacted a\nnew domestic data privacy law called the “U.K. – General Data Protection Regulation” (“UK-GDPR”).\nAlthough somewhat less restrictive than the GDPR, the UK-GDPR is similar to the GDPR with respect to\nboth an entity’s obligation to protect personal information and the imposition of significant fines for\nviolations.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR or the UK-GDPR, or with any applicable\nregulatory requirements or orders, including but not limited to privacy, data protection, information\nsecurity, or consumer protection related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions\nwithin the EU, the U.K. or elsewhere, could: result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental\nentities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change\nour business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries, or otherwise\nadversely affect our business, as we would be at risk to lose both customers and revenue, and incur\nsubstantial costs.\nWe may, in the future, incur net losses.\nAlthough the Company has been profitable since fiscal 2010, it has, in the past, incurred net losses. We\ncannot provide assurance that the Company will not incur net losses in the future.\nMarket Related Risk Factors\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are reported in\nU.S. dollars. Our operations have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar; primarily the South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, euro,\nSingapore dollar, and the British pound sterling. In 2021, we recorded a net gain from changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates of $8.0 million in our statement of income, while our net assets increased by\n$8.5 million as a result of the translation of foreign currency financial statements to U.S. dollars.\nSignificant foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations, financial\ncondition, or cash flows.\nOur hedging activity could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may enter into derivatives to manage our exposures to interest rate and currency movements. If we\ndo not accurately forecast our results of operations, execute contracts that do not effectively mitigate\nour economic exposures to interest rates and currency rates, elect to not apply hedge accounting (when\ndoing so would have mitigated our losses), or fail to comply with the complex accounting requirements\nfor hedging transactions, our results of operations and cash flows could be volatile, as well as negatively\nimpacted.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility and could fluctuate widely in response to\nvarious factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFactors that may influence the price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• loss of any of our key customers or suppliers;\n• additions or departures of key personnel;\n• third party sales of common stock;\n• our ability to execute our business plan, including but not limited to, our expansion into China;\n• announcements and consummations of business acquisitions;\n• operating results that fall below or exceed expectations;\n• announcements of forecasted earnings or material transactions;\n• issuances or repurchases of our common stock;\n• intellectual property disputes;\n• industry developments;\n• news or disclosures by competitors or customers;\n• business combinations, divestitures or bankruptcies by customers, suppliers or competitors;\n• economic and other external factors including (but not limited to) recessions, natural disasters,\nmilitary actions, political instability, or social unrest; and\n• period to period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume\nfluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market\nfluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Such\nfluctuations may be the result of imbalances between buy and sell offers, or low trading volume which\ncan magnify the effects of a small number of transactions on the price of a stock.\nWe operate in a global, competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk\nexposure.\nWe sell our products in a competitive, global environment, and compete worldwide for sales on the\nbasis of product quality, price, technology, and customer service. Sales of our products are also subject\nto federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, laws and regulations, trade agreements, import and export\ncontrols, duties, and tariffs. The imposition of additional regulations or controls including export\ncontrols, duties, tariffs, or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements, could negatively impact\nour results of operations."
