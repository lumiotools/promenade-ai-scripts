Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNov 25, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/8136/pdf)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agora, Inc. (NASDAQ: API) (the “Company”), a pioneer and leader in real-time engagement technology, today announced its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Recently, we launched our Conversational AI SDK in collaboration with OpenAI’s Realtime API to allow developers to bring voice-driven AI experiences to any app. We believe multimodal AI agents that can interact with human through natural voice will gain widespread adoption across many use cases such as customer support, education and wellness, and Agora is well positioned to become a key infrastructure provider for real-time conversational AI,” said Tony Zhao, founder, chairman and CEO of Agora. “To support this vision, we recently made some structural changes, aligning our organization to fully leverage the accelerating conversational AI opportunities, and operate in a faster, leaner, and more responsive fashion. These changes will help us build the next generation real-time engagement technology for the Generative AI era and strengthen our position as the leader in real-time engagement space.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Highlights_**\n\n  * **Total revenues** for the quarter were $31.6 million, a decrease of 9.8% from $35.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, which included decreased revenue from certain end-of-sale products of $2.4 million. \n    * **Agora** : $15.7 million for the quarter, an increase of 2.6% from $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n    * **Shengwang** : RMB112.9 million ($15.9 million) for the quarter, a decrease of 20.0% from RMB141.2 million ($19.7 million) in the third quarter of 2023, which included decreased revenue from certain end-of-sale products of RMB17.5 million ($2.4 million).\n  * **Active Customers**\n    * **Agora** : 1,762 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.9% from 1,664 as of September 30, 2023.\n    * **Shengwang** : 3,641 as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of 9.7% from 4,034 as of September 30, 2023.\n  * **Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate**\n    * **Agora** : 94% for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n    * **Shengwang** : 78% for the trailing 12-month period ended September 30, 2024.\n  * **Net loss** for the quarter was $24.2 million, which included expenses of $11.4 million in relation to the cancellation of certain employees’ equity awards, severance expenses of $4.8 million, and losses from equity in affiliates of $4.2 million, compared to net loss of $22.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.

Revenues of Agora were $15.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2.6% from $15.3 million in the same period last year, primarily due to our business expansion and usage growth in sectors such as live shopping. Revenues of Shengwang were RMB112.9 million ($15.9 million) in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 20.0% from RMB141.2 million ($19.7 million) in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in revenues of RMB 17.5 million ($2.4 million) due to the end-of-sale of certain products and reduced usage from customers in certain sectors such as social and entertainment as a result of challenging macroeconomic and regulatory environment.\n\n**Cost of Revenues** Cost of revenues was $10.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 16.4% from $12.6 million in the same period last year, primarily due to the end-of-sale of certain products and the decrease in bandwidth usage and costs, which was offset partially by severance expenses for customer support teams of $0.3 million.\n\n**Gross Profit and Gross Margin** Gross profit was $21.0 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 6.1% from $22.4 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was 66.7% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2.7% from 64.0% in the same period last year, mainly due to the end-of-sale of certain low-margin products, which was offset partially by higher severance expenses in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Operating Expenses** Operating expenses were $45.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 24.3% from $36.9 million in the same period last year, primarily due to the increase in restructuring and severance expenses in the third quarter of 2024, which included share-based compensation of $11.4 million as a result of the cancellation of certain employees’ equity awards and immediate recognition of relevant remaining unrecognized compensation expenses, as well as severance expenses of $4.4 million.\n\n  * **Research and development** expenses were $29.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 46.1% from $20.0 million in the same period last year, primarily due to restructuring and severance expenses in the third quarter of 2024, including share-based compensation of $9.0 million due to equity award cancellation and severance expenses of $3.6 million.\n  * **Sales and marketing** expenses were $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 11.9% from $7.8 million in the same period last year, primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs as the Company optimized its global workforce, which was offset partially by severance expenses of $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **General and administrative** expenses were $9.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 7.4% from $9.1 million in the same period last year, primarily due to restructuring and severance expenses in the third quarter of 2024, including share-based compensation of $2.4 million as a result of the equity award cancellation, which was offset partially by a decrease in personnel costs as the Company optimized its global workforce.\n\n\n\n**Loss from Operations** Loss from operations was $24.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $13.9 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Interest Income** Interest income was $3.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.9 million in the same period last year, primarily due to the decrease in the average balance of cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits and financial products issued by banks and the decrease in average interest rate realized.\n\n**Losses from equity in affiliates** Losses from equity in affiliates were $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to an impairment loss on an investment in certain private company of $4.1 million.\n\n**Net Loss** Net loss was $24.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.5 million in the same period last year.\n\n**Net Loss per American Depositary Share attributable to ordinary shareholders** Net loss per American Depositary Share (“ADS”)1 attributable to ordinary shareholders was $0.26 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.23 in the same period last year.\n\n_____________\n\n1 One ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Program_**\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased approximately 6.8 million of its Class A ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 1.7 million ADSs) for approximately US$3.9 million under its share repurchase program, representing 1.9% of its US$200 million share repurchase program.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased approximately 129.4 million of its Class A ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 32.3 million ADSs) for approximately US$113.7 million under its share repurchase program, representing 57% of its US$200 million share repurchase program.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 368.3 million ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 92.1 million ADSs) outstanding, compared to 449.8 million ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 112.5 million ADSs) outstanding as of January 31, 2022 before the share repurchase program commenced.\n\nThe current share repurchase program will expire at the end of February 2025.\n\n**_Executive Leadership Update_**\n\nToday the Company announced that Chief Security Officer Roger Hale will be leaving the Company, effective immediately. Mr. Hale has served in this role for the past 2.5 years, during which he made significant contributions to enhancing the Company’s security, compliance, and data protection protocols.\n\nMr. Hale will work closely with senior leadership to ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities. Moving forward, Patrick Ferriter and Robbin Liu will assume responsibility for security and compliance, reflecting the Company’s commitment to maintaining a strong and effective security framework. Mr. Hale will continue to provide strategic advice as an advisor to the Company.\n\n“We are grateful for Roger’s dedication and expertise over the past two and a half years. His leadership has been invaluable in strengthening our security & compliance foundation,” said Tony Zhao, founder, chairman and CEO of Agora. “Security and compliance remain top priorities for Agora, and we will continue to uphold the highest standards to protect our customers and stakeholders.”\n\n**_Financial Outlook_**\n\nBased on currently available information, the Company expects total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 to be between $34 million and $36 million, compared to $31.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, and $33.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 if revenues from certain end-of-sale low-margin products were excluded. The Company also expects significant improvement in net income / (loss) in the fourth quarter. This outlook reflects the Company's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change.\n\n**_Earnings Call_**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss the financial results at 5 p.m. Pacific Time / 8 p.m. Eastern Time on November 25, 2024.

The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Besides free cash flow (as defined below), each of these non-GAAP financial measures represents the corresponding GAAP financial measure before share-based compensation expenses, acquisition related expenses, amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets, income tax related to acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill. The Company believes that such non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be distorted by the effects of such share-based compensation expenses, acquisition related expenses, amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets, income tax related to acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill that it includes in its cost of revenues, total operating expenses and net income (loss). The Company believes that all such non-GAAP financial measures also provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of its historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the tables captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” included at the end of this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nDefinitions of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release are presented below.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)_**\n\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expenses, acquisition related expenses, amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets, income tax related to acquired intangible assets and impairment of goodwill.\n\n**_Free Cash Flow_**\n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment (excluding the acquisition of land use right and the payment for the headquarters project). The Company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors regarding net cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow the business.\n\n**_Operating Metrics_**\n\nThe Company also uses other operating metrics included in this press release and defined below to assess the performance of its business.\n\n**_Active Customers_**\n\nAn active customer at the end of any period is defined as an organization or individual developer from which the Company generated more than $100 of revenue during the preceding 12 months. Customers are counted based on unique customer account identifiers. Generally, one software application uses the same customer account identifier throughout its life cycle while one account may be used for multiple applications.\n\n**_Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate_**\n\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate is calculated for a trailing 12-month period by first identifying all customers in the prior 12-month period, and then calculating the quotient from dividing the revenue generated from such customers in the trailing 12-month period by the revenue generated from the same group of customers in the prior 12-month period. As the vast majority of revenue generated from Agora’s customers is denominated in U.S. dollars, while the vast majority of revenue generated from Shengwang’s customers is denominated in Renminbi, Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate is calculated in U.S. dollars for Agora and in Renminbi for Shengwang, which has substantially removed the impact of foreign currency translations. Shengwang excluded the revenues from certain end-of-sale products, Easemob’s CEC business and K12 academic tutoring sector. The Company believes Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis.\n\n**_Safe Harbor Statements_**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/240347/agora_inc_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/240347/agora_inc_logo.html)\n\n\"Real-time conversational AI is the next step in helping consumers and organizations across the world realize the benefits of this seismic and revolutionary technology,\" said Tony Zhao, CEO and Co-Founder of Agora. \"With OpenAI, our Conversational AI SDK will allow developers everywhere to increase interactivity in their apps by implementing natural voice interaction with the conversational intelligence of OpenAI, thanks to Agora's robust real-time audio streaming capabilities.\"\n\nThe Conversational AI SDK leverages Agora's intelligent routing and ultra-low latency real-time network – which powers 60 billion minutes of real-time interaction per month in over 200 countries and regions globally – to enable human-like voice interactions with OpenAI via the OpenAI Realtime API. The SDK incorporates AI echo cancellation and background noise suppression to deliver accurate voice processing in any environment, making it easy for developers to provide reliable connections with OpenAI's GPT models.\n\n\"By integrating lifelike, interactive AI learning assistants into our platform, we can enhance personalized skill assessments, improve the learning experience for developers, optimize online testing, and create new opportunities to expand our skill assessment and educational services globally,\" said Samuel Lim, CEO & Founder of Agora customer Grepp.\n\nThe new integration will allow developers to quickly build robust AI voice agents for use cases including 24/7 customer support, concierge services, health and wellness, education and language learning, gaming, voice interfaces and many more.\n\n\"Agora's Conversational AI SDK will make it easy for us to integrate real-time voice interaction with AI into our IoT products,\" said Yun Zhang, CEO & Co-founder of Wyze, an emerging Home Intelligence platform with scalable IoT devices that is also an Agora customer. \"Agora's network is a game changer, with the ultra-low latency response time necessary for truly natural voice interaction with AI-powered smart devices.\"\n\n\"The integration with OpenAI will unleash a wave of creativity and utility in the AI space unlike anything we have seen to date,\" concluded Zhao. \"Whether it's wellness coaching in the healthcare space, a 24/7 customer support agent, or a language tutoring app that can help students practice their speaking skills, our Conversational AI SDK and OpenAI's Realtime API will allow developers to imagine and build apps that would have been inconceivable only a few years ago. It will also help end users leverage AI in their daily lives in entirely new ways – and Agora is thrilled to integrate with OpenAI to make it all possible.\"\n\nFor more info on Agora's Conversational AI SDK for OpenAI, check out the webpage:[ ](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4269784-1&h=804561411&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agora.io%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fagora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpress%26utm_medium%3Dwebsite%26utm_campaign%3Dagora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk-launch%26utm_content%3Dpress-release&a=%C2%A0)[https://www.agora.io/en/products/agora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4269784-1&h=2911764304&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agora.io%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fagora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpress%26utm_medium%3Dwebsite%26utm_campaign%3Dagora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk-launch%26utm_content%3Dpress-release&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agora.io%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fagora-openai-conversational-ai-sdk%2F)\n\n**_About Agora_**\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agora is a pioneer and global leader in Real-Time Engagement Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), providing developers with simple, flexible, and powerful application programming interfaces, or APIs, to embed real-time voice, video, interactive live-streaming, chat, whiteboard, and artificial intelligence capabilities into their applications.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA22348&sd=2024-10-03) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agora-integrates-with-openai-to-enable-real-time-conversational-ai-302266291.html>\n\nSOURCE Agora, Inc.\n\nChris Clemens, Nexios Communications Strategies, LLC, chris@nexioscomms.com, 801-824-0032; Krystle Cajas, Crenshaw Communications, krystle@crenshawcomm.com, 917-667-5606\n"
