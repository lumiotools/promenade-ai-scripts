Guidance also incorporates all announced investment and disposition activity, as well as announced\nactivity under the at-the-market equity offering program. Guidance does not assume additional investment, disposition\nor capital transactions beyond those already disclosed.\nThe foregoing guidance ranges reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions.

Except as\notherwise required by law, the Company assumes no, and hereby disclaims any, obligation to update any of the\nforegoing guidance ranges as a result of new information or new or future developments.\nCommenting on the third quarter’s results, Rick Matros, CEO and Chair, said, “It feels good to be providing essentially the\nsame update as the last several quarters. Skilled nursing and managed senior housing continue to see higher occupancy and\nmargins. EBITDARM coverage for our skilled nursing portfolio has surpassed 2019 levels, while our triple net senior housing\nportfolio is approaching that milestone. Among our key triple-net relationships, the only tenant that saw a sequential coverage\ndecline was Avamere, but that was specifically due to the percentage rent we have been collecting as performance improves.\nAvamere’s coverage remains healthy, and the lease restructure has worked out exactly as anticipated.\nLeverage continues to tick down. Investments for the quarter and subsequent to quarter end totaled roughly $100 million,\nincluding those previously announced. Our investment pipeline has seen increased activity, and we are currently reviewing\nmore potential investments than we have seen all year.\nAdditionally, we have increased the midpoint of our guidance, which implies year-over-year earnings growth of more than 6%\nfor the full year.”\n2\nLIQUIDITY\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $947.8 million of liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash\nequivalents of $63.0 million, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $847.4 million and $37.4 million\nrelated to shares outstanding under forward sale agreements under our ATM program. As of September 30, 2024, we also had\n$386.7 million available under the ATM program.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND COMPANY INFORMATION\nA conference call with a simultaneous webcast to discuss the 2024 third quarter results will be held on Friday, November 1,\n2024, at 10:00 am Pacific Time.

EBITDA*\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) excluding the\nimpact of merger-related costs, stock-based compensation expense under the Company’s long-term equity award program, and\nloan loss reserves. Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance.\nBehavioral Health\nIncludes behavioral hospitals that provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients with mental health conditions, chemical\ndependence or substance addictions and addiction treatment centers that provide treatment services for chemical dependence\nand substance addictions, which may include inpatient care, outpatient care, medical detoxification, therapy and counseling.\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”)\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers\nCash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the\noperating performance of its investments. The Company defines Cash NOI as total revenues less operating expenses and non-\ncash revenues and expenses. Cash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nEBITDARM\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) for a particular facility\naccruing to the operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDARM in\ndetermining EBITDARM Coverage. EBITDARM has limitations as an analytical tool. EBITDARM does not reflect historical\ncash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition,\nEBITDARM does not represent a property’s net income or cash flows from operations and should not be considered an\nalternative to those indicators. The Company utilizes EBITDARM to evaluate the core operations of the properties by\neliminating management fees, which may vary by operator/tenant and operating structure, and as a supplemental measure of the\nability of the Company’s operators/tenants and relevant guarantors to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to\nthe Company.\nEBITDARM Coverage\nRepresents the ratio of EBITDARM to cash rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed communities) for\nthe period presented. EBITDARM Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property’s ability to generate cash flows for the\noperator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator’s/tenant’s related cash rent and other obligations to the Company.\nHowever, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDARM.\nEBITDARM Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also\nbelieves that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO (and related per share amounts) are\nimportant non-GAAP supplemental measures of the Company’s operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting\nconvention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies\nthat the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or\nfallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical\ncost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, Nareit created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating\nperformance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items,\nfrom net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or\nlosses from real estate dispositions and the Company’s share of gains or losses from real estate dispositions related to its\nunconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests,\nplus the Company’s share of depreciation and amortization related to its unconsolidated joint ventures, and real estate\nimpairment charges of both consolidated and unconsolidated entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases\nin the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding stock-based compensation expense,\nnon-cash rental and related revenues, non-cash interest income, non-cash interest expense, non-cash portion of loss on\nextinguishment of debt, provision for (recovery of) loan losses and other reserves, non-cash lease termination income and\ndeferred income taxes, as well as other non-cash revenue and expense items (including noncapitalizable acquisition costs,\ntransaction costs related to operator transitions and organizational or other restructuring activities, ineffectiveness gain/loss on\nderivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests) and the Company’s\n10\nREPORTING DEFINITIONS\nshare of non-cash adjustments related to its unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the use of FFO and\nAFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of the\nCompany’s operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among real estate investment trusts\nmore meaningful. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and\nfinancial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare the\noperating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant\nand widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flows from\noperations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the\nCompany’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital\nexpenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the\nCompany’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO\nand AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition\nor that interpret the current Nareit definition or define AFFO differently than the Company does.\nInvestment\nRepresents the carrying amount of real estate assets after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and excludes\nnet intangible assets and liabilities.\nNet Debt*\nThe principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness\nas reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, net of cash and cash equivalents as reported in the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA*\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, which is Adjusted\nEBITDA, as adjusted for annualizing adjustments that give effect to the acquisitions and dispositions completed during the\nrespective period as though such acquisitions and dispositions were completed as of the beginning of the period presented.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers\nNOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating\nperformance of its investments. The Company defines NOI as total revenues less operating expenses. NOI excludes all other\nfinancial statement amounts included in net income.\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO*\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO represent FFO and AFFO, respectively, adjusted for certain income and expense items\nthat the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results. The Company considers Normalized FFO and\nNormalized AFFO to be useful measures to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense\nitems to help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other\ncompanies. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by\nGAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating\nperformance. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures\nrelated to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future\ncash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO may not be comparable to\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance\nwith the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition or define FFO and AFFO or Normalized FFO\nand Normalized AFFO differently than the Company does.\nSenior Housing\nSenior Housing communities include independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement and memory care\ncommunities.\nSenior Housing - Managed\nSenior Housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements.\n11\nREPORTING DEFINITIONS\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities include skilled nursing, transitional care, multi-license designation and mental\nhealth facilities.\nSpecialty Hospitals and Other\nIncludes acute care, long-term acute care and rehabilitation hospitals, facilities that provide residential services, which may\ninclude assistance with activities of daily living, and other facilities not classified as Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care, Senior\nHousing or Behavioral Health.\nStabilized Facility\nAt the time of acquisition, the Company classifies each facility as either stabilized or non-stabilized. In addition, the Company\nmay classify a facility as non-stabilized after acquisition. Circumstances that could result in a facility being classified as non-\nstabilized include newly completed developments, facilities undergoing major renovations or additions, facilities being\nrepositioned or transitioned to new operators, and significant transitions within the tenants’ business model. Such facilities are\ntypically reclassified to stabilized upon the earlier of maintaining consistent performance or 24 months after the date of\nclassification as non-stabilized. Stabilized Facilities generally exclude (i) facilities held for sale, (ii) strategic disposition\ncandidates, (iii) facilities being transitioned to a new operator, (iv) facilities being transitioned from being leased by the\nCompany to being operated by the Company and (v) leased facilities acquired during the three months preceding the period\npresented.\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations, definitions and important discussions regarding the usefulness and limitations of the Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures used in this release can be found at https://ir.sabrahealth.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results.\n12"

These measures may be different than non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and the\npresentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures is\nincluded under “Reporting Definitions” in this supplement and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the GAAP financial\nmeasures we consider most comparable are included on the Investors section of our website at https://ir.sabrahealth.com/investors/\nfinancials/quarterly-results.\nTenant and Borrower Information\nThis supplement includes information regarding our tenants that lease properties from us and our borrowers, most of which are not\nsubject to SEC reporting requirements. The information related to our tenants and borrowers that is provided in this supplement has been\nprovided by, or derived from information provided by, such tenants and borrowers. We have not independently verified this information.\nWe have no reason to believe that such information is inaccurate in any material respect.

Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating performance.\nAnnualized Cash Net Operating Income (“Annualized Cash NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers\nAnnualized Cash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the\noperating performance of its investments. The Company defines Annualized Cash NOI as Annualized Revenues less operating expenses\nand non-cash revenues and expenses. Annualized Cash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nAnnualized Revenues\nThe annual contractual rental revenues under leases and interest and other income generated by the Company’s loans receivable and\nother investments based on amounts invested and applicable terms as of the end of the period presented. Annualized Revenues do not\ninclude tenant recoveries or additional rents and are adjusted to reflect actual payments received related to the twelve months ended\nat the end of the respective period for leases no longer accounted for on an accrual basis.\nBehavioral Health\nIncludes behavioral hospitals that provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients with mental health conditions, chemical\ndependence or substance addictions and addiction treatment centers that provide treatment services for chemical dependence and\nsubstance addictions, which may include inpatient care, outpatient care, medical detoxification, therapy and counseling.\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers Cash NOI\nan important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance\nof its investments. The Company defines Cash NOI as total revenues less operating expenses and non-cash revenues and expenses.\nCash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nCash NOI Margin\nCash NOI Margin is calculated as Cash NOI divided by resident fees and services.\nConsolidated Debt\nThe principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness as\nreported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Debt, Net\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness, as\nreported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Enterprise Value\nThe Company believes Consolidated Enterprise Value is an important measurement as it is a measure of a company’s value. The\nCompany calculates Consolidated Enterprise Value as market equity capitalization plus Consolidated Debt. Market equity capitalization\nis calculated as (i) the number of shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the last\nday of the period presented plus (ii) the number of shares of preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s preferred\nstock on the last day of the period presented. Consolidated Enterprise Value includes the Company’s market equity capitalization and\nConsolidated Debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\nEBITDARM\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) for a particular facility accruing to\nthe operator/tenant of the property (not the Company), for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDARM in determining EBITDARM\nCoverage. EBITDARM has limitations as an analytical tool. EBITDARM does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash\nrequirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In addition, EBITDARM does not represent a property’s net\nincome or cash flows from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. The Company utilizes EBITDARM to\nevaluate the core operations of the properties by eliminating management fees, which may vary by operator/tenant and operating\nstructure, and as a supplemental measure of the ability of the Company’s operators/tenants and relevant guarantors to generate\nsufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the Company.\nEBITDARM Coverage\nRepresents the ratio of EBITDARM to cash rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed communities) for the period\npresented. EBITDARM Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property’s ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the\nCompany) to meet the operator’s/tenant’s related cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by,\namong other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness of EBITDARM. EBITDARM Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and\nexcludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\n25 SABRA 3Q 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION September 30, 2024\nAPPENDIX\nReporting Definitions\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company also believes that\nfunds from operations, or FFO, as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment\nTrusts (“Nareit”), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO (and related per share amounts) are important non-GAAP supplemental\nmeasures of the Company’s operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets\nrequires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes\npredictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations\nof operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative.\nThus, Nareit created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical\ncost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in\naccordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and the Company’s share of gains or losses from real\nestate dispositions related to its unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to\nnoncontrolling interests, plus the Company’s share of depreciation and amortization related to its unconsolidated joint ventures, and real\nestate impairment charges of both consolidated and unconsolidated entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases\nin the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-cash\nrental and related revenues, non-cash interest income, non-cash interest expense, non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt,\nprovision for (recovery of) loan losses and other reserves, non-cash lease termination income and deferred income taxes, as well as\nother non-cash revenue and expense items (including noncapitalizable acquisition costs, transaction costs related to operator\ntransitions and organizational or other restructuring activities, ineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash\nrevenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests) and the Company’s share of non-cash adjustments related to its\nunconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the use of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with\nthe required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of the Company’s operating results among investors and makes\ncomparisons of operating results among real estate investment trusts more meaningful. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be\nuseful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed\nabove, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other\ncompanies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, they\ndo not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those\nmeasures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with\ncapital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the\nCompany’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO\nreported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret\nthe current Nareit definition or define AFFO differently than the Company does.\nGrant Income\nGrant income consists of funds specifically paid to communities in our Senior Housing - Managed portfolio from state or federal\ngovernments related to the pandemic and were incremental to the amounts that would have otherwise been received for providing\ncare to residents.\nInvestment\nRepresents the carrying amount of real estate assets after adding back accumulated depreciation and amortization and excludes net\nintangible assets and liabilities.\nMarket Capitalization\nTotal common shares of Sabra outstanding multiplied by the closing price per common share as of a given period.\nNet Debt*\nThe principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness as\nreported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, net of cash and cash equivalents as reported in the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA*\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, which is Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for\nannualizing adjustments that give effect to the acquisitions and dispositions completed during the respective period as though such\nacquisitions and dispositions were completed as of the beginning of the period presented.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”)*\nThe Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers NOI an\nimportant supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of\nits investments. The Company defines NOI as total revenues less operating expenses. NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts\nincluded in net income.\n26 SABRA 3Q 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION September 30, 2024\nAPPENDIX\nReporting Definitions\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO*\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO represent FFO and AFFO, respectively, adjusted for certain income and expense items that the\nCompany does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results. The Company considers Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO\nto be useful measures to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors\ncompare the operating performance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. Normalized FFO and\nNormalized AFFO do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an\nalternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO\nalso do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be\nindicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of Normalized FFO\nand Normalized AFFO may not be comparable to Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts\nthat do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition or define FFO and\nAFFO or Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO differently than the Company does.\nOccupancy Percentage\nOccupancy Percentage represents the facilities’ average operating occupancy for the period indicated. The percentages are calculated\nby dividing the actual census from the period presented by the available beds/units for the same period. Occupancy includes only\nStabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nREVPOR\nREVPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied unit per month at Senior Housing - Managed communities for the\nperiod indicated. It is calculated as resident fees and services revenues, excluding Grant Income, divided by average monthly occupied\nunit days. REVPOR includes only Stabilized Facilities.\nSenior Housing\nSenior Housing communities include independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement and memory care communities.\nSenior Housing - Managed\nSenior Housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements.\nSkilled Mix\nSkilled Mix is defined as the total Medicare and non-Medicaid managed care patient revenue at Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care\nfacilities divided by the total revenues at Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities for the period indicated. Skilled Mix includes only\nStabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities include skilled nursing, transitional care, multi-license designation and mental health facilities.\nSpecialty Hospitals and Other\nIncludes acute care, long-term acute care and rehabilitation hospitals, facilities that provide residential services, which may include\nassistance with activities of daily living, and other facilities not classified as Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care, Senior Housing or Behavioral\nHealth.\nStabilized Facility\nAt the time of acquisition, the Company classifies each facility as either stabilized or non-stabilized. In addition, the Company may\nclassify a facility as non-stabilized after acquisition. Circumstances that could result in a facility being classified as non-stabilized\ninclude newly completed developments, facilities undergoing major renovations or additions, facilities being repositioned or transitioned\nto new operators, and significant transitions within the tenants’ business model. Such facilities are typically reclassified to stabilized upon\nthe earlier of maintaining consistent performance or 24 months after the date of classification as non-stabilized. Stabilized Facilities\ngenerally exclude (i) facilities held for sale, (ii) strategic disposition candidates, (iii) facilities being transitioned to a new operator, (iv)\nfacilities being transitioned from being leased by the Company to being operated by the Company and (v) leased facilities acquired\nduring the three months preceding the period presented.\n*Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations, definitions and important discussions regarding the usefulness and limitations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures used\nin this supplement can be found at https://ir.sabrahealth.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results.\n27 SABRA 3Q 2024 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION September 30, 2024"

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(unaudited)\n1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nSabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (“Sabra” or the “Company”) was incorporated on May 10, 2010 as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (“Sun”) and commenced operations on November 15, 2010 following Sabra’s\nseparation from Sun. Sabra elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with the filing of its United States\n(“U.S.”) federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. Sabra believes that it has been organized and\noperated, and it intends to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. Sabra’s primary business consists of acquiring,\nfinancing and owning real estate property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. Sabra primarily generates\nrevenues by leasing properties to tenants throughout the U.S. and Canada. Sabra owns substantially all of its assets and\nproperties and conducts its operations through Sabra Health Care Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the\n“Operating Partnership”), of which Sabra is the sole general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sabra is currently the\nonly limited partner, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Company’s investment portfolio is primarily\ncomprised of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, senior housing communities (“Senior Housing - Leased”), behavioral\nhealth facilities and specialty hospitals and other facilities, in each case leased to tenants who are responsible for the operations\nof these facilities; senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management\nagreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”); investments in joint ventures; investments in loans receivable; and preferred equity\ninvestments.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sabra and its wholly owned subsidiaries as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nAll significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information as contained within the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification and the rules and regulations of the SEC, including the\ninstructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the unaudited consolidated financial statements do\nnot include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for financial statements. In the opinion of management, the\nfinancial statements for the unaudited interim periods presented include all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring\nnature, necessary for a fair statement of the results for such periods. Operating results for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.\nFor further information, refer to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.\nGAAP requires the Company to identify entities for which control is achieved through voting rights or other means and to\ndetermine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is broadly defined\nas an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the\nentity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk\nlack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the\nexpected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors\nhave voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either\ninvolve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. If the Company were\ndetermined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Company would consolidate investments in the VIE. The Company\nmay change its original assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the\ncharacteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the\nprimary beneficiary.\nThe Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or\n10\nTable of Contents\nthe right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. The Company performs this analysis on an\nongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.\nAs it relates to investments in loans, in addition to the Company’s assessment of VIEs and whether the Company is the\nprimary beneficiary of those VIEs, the Company evaluates the loan terms and other pertinent facts to determine whether the\nloan investment should be accounted for as a loan or as a real estate joint venture. If an investment has the characteristics of a\nreal estate joint venture, including if the Company participates in the majority of the borrower’s expected residual profit, the\nCompany would account for the investment as an investment in a real estate joint venture and not as a loan investment.\nExpected residual profit is defined as the amount of profit, whether called interest or another name, such as an equity kicker,\nabove a reasonable amount of interest and fees expected to be earned by a lender. At September 30, 2024, none of the\nCompany’s investments in loans were accounted for as real estate joint ventures.\nAs it relates to investments in joint ventures, the Company assesses any partners’ rights and their impact on the\npresumption of control of the partnership by any single partner. The Company also applies this guidance to managing member\ninterests in limited liability companies. The Company reassesses its determination of which entity controls the joint venture if:\nthere is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of any partners or members, the general partner or managing\nmember increases or decreases its ownership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding\nownership interests. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s determination of which entity controls its investments in joint\nventures has not changed as a result of any reassessment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nActual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Updates\nAdopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”). ASU 2020-04 provides\ntemporary optional guidance that provides transition relief for reference rate reform, including optional expedients and\nexceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform if\ncertain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance, and the provisions generally can be applied prospectively as of\nJanuary 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to\nprobability and the assessments of effectiveness for future Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”)-indexed cash flows to\nassume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives.\nFor all derivatives in hedge accounting relationships, the Company will utilize the effective relief in Topic 848 that allows for\nthe continuation of hedge accounting throughout the transition process. Application of these expedients preserves the\npresentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate\nReform (Topic 848): Scope, which refines the scope of Topic 848 and clarifies some of its guidance. In December 2022, the\nFASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which defers the\nsunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASUs 2020-04, 2021-01 and\n2022-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIssued but Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”).

These commitments are principally for\nimprovements to its facilities.\nSenior Housing - Managed Communities\nThe Company’s Senior Housing - Managed communities offer residents certain ancillary services that are not\ncontemplated in the lease with each resident (i.e., housekeeping, laundry, guest meals, etc.). These services are provided and\npaid for in addition to the standard services included in each resident lease (i.e., room and board, standard meals, etc.). The\nCompany bills residents for ancillary services one month in arrears and recognizes revenue as the services are provided, as the\nCompany has no continuing performance obligation related to those services. Resident fees and services include ancillary\nservice revenue of $1.1 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and\n$0.4 million and $1.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company received insurance proceeds related to a fire that occurred at one of the Company’s Senior Housing -\nManaged communities of $0.1 million and $1.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, and $1.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded business\ninterruption income, which is included in other income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss), of\n$0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and $0.5 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. No business interruption income was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The\nremaining proceeds were recorded as expense reimbursements in Senior Housing - Managed portfolio operating expenses on\nthe accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).\n13\nTable of Contents\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures (dollars in thousands):\nNumber of Book Value\nProperties as of Ownership as of\nProperty Type September 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 (1) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nSenior Housing\nSienna Joint Venture - Managed 12 50 % $ 115,299 $ 119,724\nSenior Housing\nMarlin Spring Joint Venture - Managed 4 85 % 15,512 17,119\n$ 130,811 $ 136,843\n(1) These investments are not consolidated because the Company does not control, through voting rights or other means, the joint ventures.\n5. IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE AND DISPOSITIONS\nImpairment of Real Estate\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized real estate impairment of $18.5\nmillion primarily related to four skilled nursing/transitional care facilities that have sold and two non-operational facilities, and\n$7.1 million related to one skilled nursing/transitional care facility that has sold, respectively.\nTo estimate the fair value of the impaired facilities, the Company utilized a market approach which considered binding\nsale agreements, non-binding offers from unrelated third parties or model-derived valuations with significant unobservable\ninputs, including comparable sales and other local and national industry market data (Level 3 measurements), as applicable. The\nCompany utilized sales price per square foot values ranging from $4 to $73 in its fair value calculations for the two non-\noperational facilities impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Company continues to evaluate additional assets for sale as part of its initiative to recycle capital and further improve\nits portfolio quality. This could lead to a shorter hold period and could result in the determination that the full amount of the\nCompany’s investment is not recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge or loss on sale which could be material.\nDispositions\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s dispositions for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNumber of facilities 8 27\nConsideration, net of closing costs $ 40.5 $ 256.2\nNet carrying value 44.5 332.1\nNet loss on sale $ (4.0) $ (75.9)\nRelated to these facilities, the Company recognized net loss of $8.2 million and $79.6 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which includes (i) impairment of $5.7 million and $7.1 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and (ii) net loss on sale.\nThe sale of the disposition facilities does not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the\nCompany’s operations and financial results, and therefore the results of operations attributable to these facilities have remained\nin continuing operations.\n6. OPERATING LEASES\nLessor Accounting\nAs of September 30, 2024, the substantial majority of the Company’s real estate properties (excluding 68 Senior Housing\n- Managed communities) were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from less than one year to 19\nyears. As of September 30, 2024, the leases had a weighted average remaining term of seven years. The leases generally include\n14\nTable of Contents\nprovisions to extend the lease terms and other negotiated terms and conditions. The Company, through its subsidiaries, retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to the tenants. The Company may receive\nadditional security under these operating leases in the form of letters of credit and security deposits from the lessee or\nguarantees from the parent of the lessee. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in accounts\npayable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $8.7 million and $16.4 million as\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and letters of credit deposited with the Company totaled\napproximately $64 million and $56 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, the\nCompany’s tenants have deposited with the Company $10.8 million and $12.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, for future real estate taxes, insurance expenditures and tenant improvements related to the\nCompany’s properties and their operations, and these amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nLessor costs that are paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessee are included in the measurement of variable lease\nrevenue and the associated expense. As a result, the Company recognized variable lease revenue and the associated expense of\n$3.5 million and $10.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $3.8 million and\n$11.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company monitors the creditworthiness of its tenants by evaluating the ability of the tenants to meet their lease\nobligations to the Company based on the tenants’ financial performance, including, as applicable and appropriate, the\nevaluation of any parent guarantees (or the guarantees of other related parties) of such lease obligations. The primary basis for\nthe Company’s evaluation of the credit quality of its tenants (and more specifically the tenant’s ability to pay their rent\nobligations to the Company) is the tenant’s lease coverage ratio as supplemented by the parent’s fixed charge coverage ratio for\nthose entities with a parent guarantee. These coverage ratios include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization\nand rent (“EBITDAR”) to rent and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees\n(“EBITDARM”) to rent at the lease level and consolidated EBITDAR to total fixed charges at the parent guarantor level when\nsuch a guarantee exists. The Company obtains various financial and operational information from the majority of its tenants\neach month and reviews this information in conjunction with the above-described coverage metrics to identify financial and\noperational trends, evaluate the impact of the industry’s operational and financial environment (including the impact of\ngovernment reimbursement), and evaluate the management of the tenant’s operations. These metrics help the Company identify\npotential areas of concern relative to its tenants’ credit quality and ultimately the tenant’s ability to generate sufficient liquidity\nto meet its obligations, including its obligation to continue to pay the rent due to the Company.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no tenant relationship represented 10% or more of the\nCompany’s total revenues.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the future minimum rental payments from the Company’s properties held for investment\nunder non-cancelable operating leases were as follows and may materially differ from actual future rental payments received (in\nthousands):\nOctober 1 through December 31, 2024 $ 92,198\n2025 371,685\n2026 358,650\n2027 342,012\n2028 319,885\nThereafter 1,422,310\n$ 2,906,740\nLessee Accounting\nFor operating leases greater than 12 months for which the Company is the lessee, such as corporate office leases and\nground leases, the Company recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and related lease liability on its consolidated balance\nsheets at inception of the lease. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease\nliabilities are determined based on the estimated present value of the Company’s minimum lease payments under the\nagreements. The discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities is based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate on a\nlease-by-lease basis. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements have options to extend or terminate the contract terms upon\nmeeting certain criteria. The lease term utilized in the calculation of the lease liability includes these options if exercise is\nconsidered reasonably certain. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $7.2 million and\n$11.6 million of ROU assets included in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net, and $8.4 million and\n15\nTable of Contents\n$12.5 million of lease liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, respectively, on its consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe Company incurred lease expense of $0.3 million and $1.1 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate were 13 years and\n8%, respectively, and the future minimum lease payments under the operating leases included in the Company’s lease liability\nwere as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 1 through December 31, 2024 $ 294\n2025 1,518\n2026 1,032\n2027 1,047\n2028 1,021\nThereafter 8,938\nUndiscounted minimum lease payments included in the lease liability 13,850\nLess: imputed interest (5,454)\nPresent value of lease liability $ 8,396\n7.

See Note 9, “Derivative\nand Hedging Instruments,” for further information.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that include restrictions or limitations on the ability to pay\ndividends, incur additional indebtedness, engage in non-healthcare related business activities, enter into transactions with\naffiliates and sell or otherwise transfer certain assets as well as customary events of default. The Credit Agreement also requires\nSabra, through the Operating Partnership, to comply with specified financial covenants, which include a maximum total\nleverage ratio, a maximum secured debt leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unsecured leverage\nratio, a minimum tangible net worth requirement and a minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nInterest Expense\nThe Company incurred interest expense of $29.5 million and $87.2 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, and $28.2 million and $85.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023, respectively. Interest expense includes non-cash interest expense of $2.6 million and $8.8 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $3.1 million and $9.2 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $23.3 million and\n$16.5 million, respectively, of accrued interest included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nMaturities\nThe following is a schedule of maturities for the Company’s outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nSecured Revolving Credit\nIndebtedness Facility (1) Term Loans Senior Notes Total\nOctober 1 through December 31, 2024 $ 513 $ — $ — $ — $ 513\n2025 2,089 — — — 2,089\n2026 2,147 — — 500,000 502,147\n2027 2,206 152,558 — 100,000 254,764\n2028 2,266 — 540,985 — 543,251\nThereafter 37,402 — — 1,150,000 1,187,402\nTotal Debt 46,623 152,558 540,985 1,750,000 2,490,166\nDiscount, net — — — (4,826) (4,826)\nDeferred financing costs, net (806) — (5,001) (9,326) (15,133)\nTotal Debt, Net $ 45,817 $ 152,558 $ 535,984 $ 1,735,848 $ 2,470,207\n(1) Revolving Credit Facility is subject to two six-month extension options.\n9. DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company is exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest\nrates and foreign exchange rates. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from\nbusiness activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are\ndetermined by interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage\ndifferences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments\nprincipally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.\nCertain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange\nrates. These fluctuations may impact the value in the Company’s functional currency, the U.S. dollar, of the Company’s\n19\nTable of Contents\ninvestment in foreign operations, the cash receipts and payments related to these foreign operations and payments of interest\nand principal under Canadian dollar denominated debt. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to protect the\nvalue of its foreign investments and fix a portion of the interest payments for certain debt obligations. The Company does not\nenter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its\nexposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and\ncollars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $3.3 million of gains,\nwhich are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12\nmonths.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in Canada. The Company uses\ncross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on these foreign investments.\nThe following presents the notional amount of derivative instruments as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nDenominated in U.S. Dollars $ 430,000 $ 753,750\nDenominated in Canadian Dollars $ 150,000 $ 300,000\nDerivatives designated as net investment hedges:\nDenominated in Canadian Dollars $ 47,358 $ 55,335\nFinancial instruments designated as net investment hedges:\nDenominated in Canadian Dollars $ 191,300 $ 194,300\nDerivatives not designated as net investment hedges:\nDenominated in Canadian Dollars $ 8,942 $ 965\nDerivative and Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe following is a summary of the derivative and financial instruments designated as hedging instruments held by the\nCompany at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFair Value as of Maturity Dates\nCount as of as of\nSeptember 30, September 30, December 31, September 30,\nType Designation 2024 2024 2023 2024 Balance Sheet Location\nAssets:\nAccounts receivable, prepaid\nInterest rate swaps Cash flow 4 $ 5,884 $ 6,002 2028 expenses and other assets, net\nAccounts receivable, prepaid\nInterest rate collars Cash flow — — 3,216 — expenses and other assets, net\nForward starting Accounts receivable, prepaid\ninterest rate swaps Cash flow — — 6,736 — expenses and other assets, net\nCross currency Net Accounts receivable, prepaid\ninterest rate swaps investment 2 3,824 2,964 2025 expenses and other assets, net\n$ 9,708 $ 18,918\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued\nInterest rate swaps Cash flow 1 $ 292 $ — 2028 liabilities\nCAD borrowings\nunder Revolving Net\nCredit Facility investment 1 30,558 33,429 2027 Revolving credit facility\nNet\nCAD Term Loan investment 1 110,985 113,190 2028 Term loans, net\n$ 141,835 $ 146,619\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following presents the effect of the Company’s derivative and financial instruments designated as hedging\ninstruments on the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the consolidated statements of equity for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n(Loss) Gain Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash Flow Hedges:\nInterest rate products $ (12,932) $ 11,373 $ 1,609 $ 28,462\nNet Investment Hedges:\nForeign currency products (312) 1,140 982 349\nCAD borrowings under Revolving\nCredit Facility (699) 42 (1,156) (2,650)\nCAD Term Loan (1,320) 2,760 2,205 265\n$ (15,263) $ 15,315 $ 3,640 $ 26,426\nGain Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nIncome Statement Location 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCash Flow Hedges:\nInterest rate products Interest expense $ 2,531 $ 2,369 $ 7,369 $ 5,848\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no cash flow hedges were determined to be\nineffective.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had one outstanding cross currency interest rate swap, of which a portion was\nnot designated as a hedging instrument, in an asset position with a fair value of $0.6 million that is included in accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company recorded $0.1 million of other expense and $0.1 million of other income, respectively,\nrelated to the portion of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and no such expense was recorded during each of the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOffsetting Derivatives\nThe Company enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. The table below presents a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net\npresentation of the Company’s derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the\nNet Amounts of Balance Sheet\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Assets / Liabilities\nRecognized Offset in the presented in the Financial Cash Collateral\nAssets / Liabilities Balance Sheet Balance Sheet Instruments Received Net Amount\nOffsetting Assets:\nDerivatives $ 9,708 $ — $ 9,708 $ — $ — $ 9,708\nOffsetting Liabilities:\nDerivatives $ 292 $ — $ 292 $ — $ — $ 292\n21\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the\nNet Amounts of Balance Sheet\nGross Amounts of Gross Amounts Assets / Liabilities\nRecognized Offset in the presented in the Financial Cash Collateral\nAssets / Liabilities Balance Sheet Balance Sheet Instruments Received Net Amount\nOffsetting Assets:\nDerivatives $ 18,918 $ — $ 18,918 $ — $ — $ 18,918\nOffsetting Liabilities:\nDerivatives $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCredit Risk-related Contingent Features\nThe Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision pursuant to which the\nCompany could be declared in default on the derivative obligation if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including\na default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value\nof derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk,\nrelated to these agreements was $0.3 million. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not posted any collateral related to\nthese agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2024, it could have been required to\nsettle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $0.3 million.\n10. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\nUnder GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In\naddition, the Company is required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis\n(e.g., carrying value of impaired loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be\nreceived upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and\ndisclosed in one of the following three categories:\n• Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets\nor liabilities;\n• Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in\nmarkets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers\nare observable in active markets; and\n• Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both\nsignificant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other\nvaluation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key\ndeterminant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.\nFinancial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and whose markets contain\norderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments whose markets are\ninactive or consist of non-orderly trades. The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or\nwhen market transactions are not orderly. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable,\naccrued liabilities and the Credit Agreement are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short-term maturities of these\ninstruments. Fair values for other financial instruments are derived as follows:\nLoans receivable: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their amortized\ncost and not at fair value. The fair values of the loans receivable were estimated using an internal valuation model that\nconsidered the expected cash flows for the loans receivable, as well as the underlying collateral value and other credit\nenhancements as applicable. The Company utilized discount rates ranging from 6% to 13% with a weighted average rate of 6%\nin its fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.\nPreferred equity investments: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their\ncost and not at fair value. The fair values of the preferred equity investments were estimated using an internal valuation model\n22\nTable of Contents\nthat considered the expected future cash flows for the preferred equity investments, the underlying collateral value and other\ncredit enhancements. The Company utilized discount rates ranging from 10% to 15% with a weighted average rate of 11% in\nits fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.\nDerivative instruments: The Company’s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates the fair value of derivative instruments, including its interest rate swaps,\ninterest rate collars and cross currency swaps, using the assistance of a third party using inputs that are observable in the\nmarket, which include forward yield curves and other relevant information. Although the Company has determined that the\nmajority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit\nvaluation adjustments associated with its derivative financial instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current\ncredit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance\nof the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the\ncredit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. As a result, the\nCompany has determined that its derivative financial instruments valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nSenior Notes: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their outstanding\nprincipal balance, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums/discounts and not at fair value. The fair values of\nthe Senior Notes were determined using third-party market quotes derived from orderly trades. As such, the Company classifies\nthese instruments as Level 2.\nSecured indebtedness: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their\noutstanding principal balance, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums/discounts and not at fair value. The\nfair values of the Company’s secured debt were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s\nestimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-\nvalue ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. The Company utilized a rate of 6% in its fair value calculation. As\nsuch, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.\nThe following are the face values, carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 whose carrying amounts do not approximate their fair value (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nFace Carrying Fair Face Carrying Fair\nValue (1) Amount (2) Value Value (1) Amount (2) Value\nFinancial assets:\nLoans receivable $ 391,685 $ 382,017 $ 403,673 $ 372,873 $ 362,775 $ 383,141\nPreferred equity investments 59,611 59,808 61,606 57,681 57,849 59,526\nFinancial liabilities:\nSenior Notes 1,750,000 1,735,848 1,644,025 1,750,000 1,735,253 1,567,428\nSecured indebtedness 46,623 45,817 36,431 48,143 47,301 36,279\n(1) Face value represents amounts contractually due under the terms of the respective agreements.\n(2)Carrying amount represents the book value of financial instruments, including unamortized premiums/discounts and deferred financing costs.\nThe Company determined the fair value of financial instruments as of September 30, 2024 whose carrying amounts do\nnot approximate their fair value with valuation methods utilizing the following types of inputs (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nTotal (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets:\nLoans receivable $ 403,673 $ — $ — $ 403,673\nPreferred equity investments 61,606 — — 61,606\nFinancial liabilities:\nSenior Notes 1,644,025 — 1,644,025 —\nSecured indebtedness 36,431 — — 36,431\n23\nTable of Contents\nDisclosure of the fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company at the\napplicable dates and requires a significant amount of judgment. Transaction volume for certain of the Company’s financial\ninstruments remains relatively low, which has made the estimation of fair values difficult. Therefore, both the actual results and\nthe Company’s estimate of fair value at a future date could be materially different.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded the following amounts measured at fair value\n(in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant Other Significant\nIdentical Assets Observable Inputs Unobservable Inputs\nTotal (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nRecurring Basis:\nFinancial assets:\nInterest rate swaps $ 5,884 $ — $ 5,884 $ —\nCross currency interest rate swaps 3,824 — 3,824 —\nFinancial liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps 292 — 292 —\n11. EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nOn February 23, 2023, the Company established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”)\npursuant to which shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million may be sold from\ntime to time (i) by the Company through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as\nprincipals or (ii) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward\nsale agreement. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares at\nthe time the agreement is effective, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of the shares until a later date. The Company\nmay also elect to cash settle or net share settle all or a portion of its obligations under any forward sale agreement. The forward\nsale agreements have a one year term during which time the Company may settle the forward sales by delivery of physical\nshares of common stock to the forward purchasers or, at the Company’s election, in cash or net shares. The forward sale price\nthat the Company expects to receive upon settlement will be the initial forward price established upon the effective date, subject\nto adjustments for (i) the forward purchasers’ stock borrowing costs and (ii) certain fixed price reductions during the term of the\nagreement.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to\nallow for the sale of up to 4.2 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial weighted average price of $16.10 per\nshare, net of commissions, and the Company settled 2.3 million shares at a weighted average net price of $15.13 per share, after\ncommissions and fees, resulting in net proceeds of $35.1 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to\nallow for the sale of up to 7.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial weighted average price of $15.41 per\nshare, net of commissions, and the Company settled 5.0 million shares at a weighted average net price of $14.70 per share, after\ncommissions and fees, resulting in net proceeds of $74.2 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 2.2 million shares remained outstanding under the forward sale agreements, with an initial\nweighted average price of $16.77 per share, net of commissions.\nNo other shares were sold under the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $386.7 million available under the ATM Program.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe following table lists the cash dividends on common stock declared and paid by the Company during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024:\nDeclaration Date Record Date Amount Per Share Dividend Payable Date\nFebruary 1, 2024 February 13, 2024 $ 0.30 February 29, 2024\nMay 8, 2024 May 20, 2024 $ 0.30 May 31, 2024\nAugust 7, 2024 August 19, 2024 $ 0.30 August 30, 2024\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 0.3 million shares of common stock as a result\nof restricted stock unit vestings.\nUpon any payment of shares to team members as a result of restricted stock unit vestings, the team members’ related tax\nwithholding obligation will generally be satisfied by the Company reducing the number of shares to be delivered by a number\nof shares necessary to satisfy the related applicable tax withholding obligation. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in tax withholding obligations on behalf of\nits team members that were satisfied through a reduction in the number of shares delivered to those participants.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nForeign currency translation (loss) gain $ (263) $ 963\nUnrealized gain on cash flow hedges 17,202 22,782\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive income $ 16,939 $ 23,745\n12.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 800 restricted stock units and 5,200 shares related\nto forward equity sale agreements were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because they were considered anti-\ndilutive. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 1.6 million and 1.4 million restricted\nstock units, respectively, were not included in computing diluted earnings per share because they were considered anti-dilutive.\n25\nTable of Contents\n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental\nAs an owner of real estate, the Company is subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.\nThe Company is not aware of any environmental liability that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or\nresults of operations. However, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, the uses and conditions of properties\nin the vicinity of the Company’s properties, the activities of its tenants and other environmental conditions of which the\nCompany is unaware with respect to the properties could result in future environmental liabilities. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Company does not expect that compliance with existing environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are party to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its\nbusiness. Management is not aware of any legal proceedings where the likelihood of a loss contingency is reasonably possible\nand the amount or range of reasonably possible losses is material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or\ncash flows.\n14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluates subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.\nDividend Declaration\nOn October 31, 2024, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common\nstock. The dividend will be paid on November 29, 2024 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on\nNovember 15, 2024.\n26\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe discussion below contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those\nwhich are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Also see\n“Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying unaudited consolidated\nfinancial statements and the notes thereto.\nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:\n• Overview\n• Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n• Recently Issued Accounting Standards Update\n• Results of Operations\n• Liquidity and Capital Resources\n• Concentration of Credit Risk\n• Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates\nOverview\nWe operate as a self-administered, self-managed REIT that, through our subsidiaries, owns and invests in real estate\nserving the healthcare industry.\nOur primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real property to be leased to third party tenants in the\nhealthcare sector. We primarily generate revenues by leasing properties to tenants and owning properties operated by third-\nparty property managers throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada.\nOur investment portfolio is primarily comprised of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, senior housing communities\n(“Senior Housing - Leased”), behavioral health facilities, and specialty hospitals and other facilities, in each case leased to\nthird-party operators; senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management\nagreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”); investments in joint ventures; loans receivable; and preferred equity investments.\nWe expect to grow our investment portfolio while diversifying our portfolio by tenant, facility type and geography within\nthe healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in\nhealthcare real estate, including the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers. We also intend to\nachieve our objective of diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type through select asset sales and other arrangements\nwith our tenants.\nWe employ a disciplined approach in our healthcare real estate investment strategy by investing in assets that provide\nattractive opportunities for earnings growth and appreciation of asset values, while maintaining balance sheet strength and\nliquidity, thereby creating long-term stockholder value.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning\nJanuary 1, 2011. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner\nto qualify as a REIT. We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which\nsubstantially all of our properties and assets are held by Sabra Health Care Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership\n(the “Operating Partnership”), of which we are the sole general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours is currently the\nonly limited partner, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.\nMarket Trends and Uncertainties\nOur operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. Increases in\ninterest rates, labor shortages, inflation and increased volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased\ncosts and limited the availability of capital.\nThe above factors, together with the impact of COVID-19, have resulted in decreased occupancy and increased operating\ncosts for our tenants and borrowers, which have negatively impacted their operating results and may adversely impact their\nability to make full and timely rental payments and debt service payments, respectively, to us. Our Senior Housing - Managed\nportfolio has been similarly impacted, and we expect that decreased occupancy and increased operating costs will continue to\n27\nTable of Contents\nnegatively impact the operating results of these investments. While our tenants, borrowers and Senior Housing - Managed\nportfolio have experienced increases in occupancy, certain of those occupancy rates are still below pre-pandemic levels. On the\nlabor front, our tenants, borrowers and Senior Housing - Managed portfolio have significantly reduced their reliance on agency\nstaffing which was a mainstay in the wake of COVID-19, and while they continue to experience improvements in both\npermanent labor availability and overall costs from the worst points of the pandemic, permanent labor supply remains lower\nand costs remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. We are, however, encouraged by increases our tenants are receiving in\nreimbursement rates in our skilled nursing/transitional care portfolio, as those increases have led to margin recovery despite\noccupancy being below pre-pandemic levels.\nIn some cases, we may have to restructure or temporarily defer tenants’ long-term rent obligations and may not be able to\ndo so on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place. Reduced or modified rental and debt service amounts\ncould result in the determination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an\nimpairment charge. If our tenants and borrowers default on these obligations, such defaults could materially and adversely\naffect our results of operations and liquidity, in addition to resulting in potential impairment charges. Further, prolonged\ndeterioration in the operating results for our investments in our Senior Housing - Managed portfolio could result in the\ndetermination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an impairment charge.\nWe regularly monitor the effects of economic and market conditions on our operations and financial position, as well as\non the operations and financial position of our tenants and borrowers, in order to respond and adapt to the ongoing changes in\nour operating environment.\nAcquisitions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired two Senior Housing - Managed communities and one\nSenior Housing - Leased community for aggregate consideration of $112.2 million, including acquisition costs. See Note 3,\n“Recent Real Estate Acquisitions (Consolidated),” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\nregarding these investments.\nDispositions\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the sale of eight skilled nursing/transitional care\nfacilities for aggregate consideration, net of closing costs, of $40.5 million. The net carrying value of the assets and liabilities of\nthese facilities was $44.5 million, which resulted in an aggregate $4.0 million net loss on sale. We continue to evaluate\nadditional assets for sale as part of our initiative to recycle capital and further improve our portfolio quality.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”) and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”). The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported\nin our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of\nour results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management\nconsiders critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that\nare inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results is\nincluded in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. There have been no significant\nchanges to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Update\nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for\ninformation concerning recently issued accounting standards updates.\nResults of Operations\nAs of September 30, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of 373 real estate properties held for investment, 14\ninvestments in loans receivable, five preferred equity investments and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of\nSeptember 30, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of 377 real estate properties held for investment, 12 investments in\nloans receivable, five preferred equity investments and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In general, we expect\nthat income and expenses related to our portfolio will fluctuate in future periods in comparison to the corresponding prior\nperiods as a result of investment and disposition activity and anticipated future changes in our portfolio. The results of\n28\nTable of Contents\noperations presented are not directly comparable due to ongoing acquisition and disposition activity, including our capital\nrecycling initiative.\nComparison of results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nVariance due to\nAcquisitions,\nThree Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease / Percentage Originations and Remaining\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Difference Dispositions (1) Variance (2)\nRevenues:\nRental and related revenues $ 94,555 $ 93,085 $ 1,470 2 % $ (176) $ 1,646\nResident fees and services 73,746 59,748 13,998 23 % 4,180 9,818\nInterest and other income 9,700 8,794 906 10 % 439 467\nExpenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 42,720 43,242 (522) (1) % 595 (1,117)\nInterest 29,467 28,156 1,311 5 % — 1,311\nTriple-net portfolio operating\nexpenses 4,270 4,304 (34) (1) % (48) 14\nSenior housing - managed\nportfolio operating expenses 54,234 44,523 9,711 22 % 2,507 7,204\nGeneral and administrative 12,404 10,759 1,645 15 % — 1,645\n(Recovery of) provision for\nloan losses (148) 328 (476) (145) % (483) 7\nOther expense:\nOther income — 2,229 (2,229) (100) % — (2,229)\nNet loss on sales of real estate (5,745) (46,545) 40,800 (88) % 40,800 —\nIncome (loss) from\nunconsolidated joint ventures 214 (645) 859 (133) % — 859\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 265 (455) 720 (158) % — 720\n(1) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as\na result of investments/dispositions made after July 1, 2023.\n(2) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nthat is not a direct result of investments/dispositions made after July 1, 2023.\nRental and Related Revenues\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $94.6 million of rental income compared to $93.1\nmillion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $1.5 million net increase in rental income is related to (i) a $1.9\nmillion increase from properties acquired after July 1, 2023, (ii) a $1.5 million net increase in rental and related revenues related\nto leases that are no longer accounted for on an accrual basis, (iii) a $0.8 million increase due to lease amendments and annual\nrental increases based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, (iv) a $0.8 million increase from properties that were\ntransitioned to new operators and (v) a $0.6 million increase due to incremental revenue related to capital expenditures. These\nincreases are partially offset by an increase of $2.4 million in cash and non-cash rent receivable write-offs related to leases that\nare no longer accounted for on an accrual basis and a $2.1 million decrease from properties disposed of after July 1, 2023.\nOur reported rental and related revenues may be subject to increased variability in the future as a result of lease\naccounting standards. If at any time we cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are\ncollectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received and all receivables associated with the\nlease will be written off, irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. However, there can be no assurances regarding the\ntiming and amount of these revenues. Amounts due under the terms of all of our lease agreements are subject to contractual\nincreases, and contingent rental income may be derived from certain lease agreements. No material contingent rental income\nwas derived during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nResident Fees and Services\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $73.7 million of resident fees and services compared\nto $59.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $14.0 million net increase is due to a $5.3 million\nincrease related to five facilities that were transitioned to Senior Housing - Managed communities after July 1, 2023, a $4.2\n29\nTable of Contents\nmillion increase related to two Senior Housing - Managed communities acquired after July 1, 2023 and the remaining increase\nis primarily related to increased occupancy and an increase in rates.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest and other income primarily consists of income earned on our loans receivable investments and preferred returns\nearned on our preferred equity investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $9.7 million of\ninterest and other income compared to $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase of $0.9\nmillion is due to (i) a $0.4 million increase from investments made after July 1, 2023, (ii) a $0.2 million lease termination\npayment primarily related to one skilled nursing/transitional care facility, (iii) a $0.1 million increase due to increased fundings\nfor existing investments and (iv) a $0.1 million increase in bank interest income.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $42.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense\ncompared to $43.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net decrease of $0.5 million is due to a $1.5\nmillion decrease due to assets that have been fully depreciated and a $1.3 million decrease from properties disposed of after\nJuly 1, 2023. These decreases are partially offset by a $1.9 million increase from properties acquired after July 1, 2023 and a\n$0.5 million increase from additions to real estate.\nInterest Expense\nWe incur interest expense comprised of costs of borrowings plus the amortization of deferred financing costs related to\nour indebtedness. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $29.5 million of interest expense compared\nto $28.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $1.3 million net increase is primarily related to a $1.8\nmillion increase in interest expense related to borrowings under the Credit Agreement (as defined below), partially offset by a\n$0.5 million decrease in non-cash interest expense related to our interest rate hedges.\nTriple-Net Portfolio Operating Expenses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $4.3 million of triple-net portfolio operating expenses\ncompared to $4.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $34,000 net decrease is primarily due to\nfacilities that have since transitioned to new operators who are now paying the property taxes directly and adjustments to our\nestimates related to property taxes.\nSenior Housing - Managed Portfolio Operating Expenses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $54.2 million of Senior Housing - Managed portfolio\noperating expenses compared to $44.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $9.7 million net increase is\ndue to (i) a $4.6 million increase related to five facilities that were transitioned to Senior Housing - Managed communities after\nJuly 1, 2023, (ii) a $2.5 million increase related to two Senior Housing - Managed communities acquired after July 1, 2023, (iii)\na $1.4 million increase in employee compensation primarily due to increased labor rates and staffing, (iv) a $0.6 million\nincrease in management fees, dining expenses and housekeeping costs due to increased occupancy and (v) a $0.5 million\nincrease in marketing, administrative and corporate overhead expense.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation-related expenses as well as professional services, office costs,\nother costs associated with asset management, and acquisition costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ngeneral and administrative expenses were $12.4 million compared to $10.8 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The $1.6 million net increase is primarily related to a $2.1 million increase in compensation, including a\n$0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation, for our teammates as a result of changes in performance-based payout\nassumptions on compensation and annual salary adjustments, partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in insurance expense.\n(Recovery of) Provision for Loan Losses\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a $0.1 million recovery of and a $0.3\nmillion provision for loan losses, respectively, associated with our loans receivable investments.\nOther Income\nNo other income was recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

This income is partially offset by $1.4 million of\ntransition-related expenses related to the transition of 14 Senior Housing - Managed communities to new operators in 2023.\nNet Loss on Sales of Real Estate\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $5.7 million related to the\ndisposition of four skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we\nrecognized an aggregate net loss of $46.5 million related to the disposition of 13 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and\ntwo Senior Housing - Leased communities.\nIncome (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $0.2 million of income from our unconsolidated joint\nventures compared to $0.6 million of loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $0.9 million net improvement is\nprimarily related to a $0.8 million increase in revenues net of operating expenses primarily due to increased occupancy.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $0.3 million of income tax benefit compared to $0.5\nmillion of income tax expense during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The $0.7 million change is due to lower\ntaxable income during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nComparison of results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 (dollars in thousands):\nVariance due to\nAcquisitions,\nNine Months Ended September 30,\nIncrease / Percentage Originations and Remaining\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Difference Dispositions (1) Variance (2)\nRevenues:\nRental and related revenues $ 285,427 $ 283,229 $ 2,198 1 % $ (2,207) $ 4,405\nResident fees and services 207,716 174,897 32,819 19 % 5,849 26,970\nInterest and other income 27,746 25,991 1,755 7 % 370 1,385\nExpenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 127,315 140,211 (12,896) (9) % (2,411) (10,485)\nInterest 87,189 85,024 2,165 3 % — 2,165\nTriple-net portfolio operating\nexpenses 12,992 13,243 (251) (2) % (159) (92)\nSenior housing - managed\nportfolio operating expenses 154,258 132,124 22,134 17 % 2,923 19,211\nGeneral and administrative 37,035 30,793 6,242 20 % — 6,242\n(Recovery of) provision for\nloan losses (446) 549 (995) (181) % (487) (508)\nImpairment of real estate 18,472 7,064 11,408 161 % (1,385) 12,793\nOther income (expense):\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — (1,541) 1,541 (100) % — 1,541\nOther income 838 2,570 (1,732) (67) % 82 (1,814)\nNet loss on sales of real estate (3,969) (75,893) 71,924 (95) % 71,924 —\nLoss from unconsolidated joint\nventures (301) (2,136) 1,835 (86) % 143 1,692\nIncome tax expense (625) (1,509) 884 (59) % — 884\n(1) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as\na result of investments/dispositions made after January 1, 2023.\n(2) Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nthat is not a direct result of investments/dispositions made after January 1, 2023.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRental and Related Revenues\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $285.4 million of rental income compared to $283.2\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $27.7 million of\ninterest and other income compared to $26.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The $0.9 million decrease is due to lower taxable income during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFunds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nWe believe that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds\nfrom operations (“FFO”), as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (“Nareit”), and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) (and related per share amounts) are important non-\nGAAP supplemental measures of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real\nestate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real\nestate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market\nand other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be\nless informative. Thus, Nareit created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes\nhistorical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net\nincome, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and our share of gains or\nlosses from real estate dispositions related to our unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization,\nnet of amounts related to noncontrolling interests, plus our share of depreciation and amortization related to our unconsolidated\njoint ventures, and real estate impairment charges of both consolidated and unconsolidated entities when the impairment is\ndirectly attributable to decreases in the value of the depreciable real estate held by the entity. AFFO is defined as FFO\nexcluding stock-based compensation expense, non-cash rental and related revenues, non-cash interest income, non-cash interest\nexpense, non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for (recovery of) loan losses and other reserves, non-\ncash lease termination income and deferred income taxes, as well as other non-cash revenue and expense items (including\nnoncapitalizable acquisition costs, transaction costs related to operator transitions and organizational or other restructuring\nactivities, ineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to\nnoncontrolling interests) and our share of non-cash adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the\nuse of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the\nunderstanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among REITs more\nmeaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance\nbecause, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance\nbetween periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating\nperformance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be\nconsidered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not\nconsider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of\ncash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to\nFFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that\ninterpret the current Nareit definition or define AFFO differently than we do.\n34\nTable of Contents\nThe following table reconciles our calculations of FFO and AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for the same periods (in thousands,\nexcept share and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income (loss) $ 29,788 $ (15,101) $ 80,017 $ (3,400)\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets 42,720 43,242 127,315 140,211\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment of real estate assets\nrelated to unconsolidated joint ventures 2,243 2,255 6,680 6,505\nNet loss on sales of real estate 5,745 46,545 3,969 75,893\nImpairment of real estate — — 18,472 7,064\nFFO 80,496 76,941 236,453 226,273\nStock-based compensation expense 2,586 2,235 6,448 5,468\nNon-cash rental and related revenues (433) (1,312) (2,229) (6,781)\nNon-cash interest income 12 8 24 (380)\nNon-cash interest expense 2,611 3,088 8,750 9,179\nNon-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt — — — 1,541\n(Recovery of) provision for loan losses (148) 328 (446) 549\nOther adjustments related to unconsolidated joint ventures 113 133 401 371\nOther adjustments 353 256 1,192 950\nAFFO $ 85,590 $ 81,677 $ 250,593 $ 237,170\nFFO per diluted common share $ 0.34 $ 0.33 $ 1.01 $ 0.97\nAFFO per diluted common share $ 0.36 $ 0.35 $ 1.06 $ 1.01\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding,\ndiluted:\nFFO 237,043,400 232,835,849 234,777,101 232,566,392\nAFFO 237,940,868 233,988,463 235,890,966 233,878,874\nThe following table sets forth additional information related to certain other items included in net income above, and the\nportions of each that are included in FFO and AFFO, which may be helpful in assessing our operating results.

The\n35\nTable of Contents\nCredit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.75 billion (from U.S.\n$1.4 billion plus CAD $150.0 million), subject to terms and conditions.\nWe have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that expires in November 2025, which allows us to offer and\nsell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units, and certain of our subsidiaries to offer and sell debt\nsecurities, through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at\nprices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions.\nOn February 23, 2023, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant to which\nshares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million may be sold from time to time (i) by\nus through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals or (ii) by a consortium of\nbanks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward sale agreement.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to allow for the\nsale of up to 4.2 million shares of our common stock at an initial weighted average price of $16.10 per share, net of\ncommissions, and we settled 2.3 million shares at a weighted average net price of $15.13 per share, after commissions and fees,\nresulting in net proceeds of $35.1 million.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to allow for the\nsale of up to 7.3 million shares of our common stock at an initial weighted average price of $15.41 per share, net of\ncommissions, and we settled 5.0 million shares at a weighted average net price of $14.70 per share, after commissions and fees,\nresulting in net proceeds of $74.2 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, 2.2 million shares remained outstanding under the forward sale agreements, with an initial\nweighted average price of $16.77 per share, net of commissions.\nNo other shares were sold under the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $386.7 million available under the ATM Program. Subject to market conditions, we\nexpect to use proceeds from our ATM Program to finance future investments in properties.\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, including our planned capital expenditures\nand funding commitments, interest expense, scheduled debt service payments under our loan agreements, dividend\nrequirements, general and administrative expenses and other requirements described under “Material Cash Requirements”\nbelow. Based on our current assessment, we believe that our available cash, operating cash flows and borrowings available to us\nunder our Revolving Credit Facility provide sufficient funds for such requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, we\ndo not believe that the restrictions under our Senior Notes Indentures (as defined below) or Credit Agreement significantly limit\nour ability to use our available liquidity for these purposes.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of future investments in properties, including any improvements\nor renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, as well as scheduled debt maturities. We expect to meet these liquidity\nneeds using the sources above as well as the proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities,\nadditional borrowings, including mortgage debt or a new or refinanced credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of properties.\nIn addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S.\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $230.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating\ncash inflows were derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, resident fees and services\nnet of the corresponding operating expenses, and interest payments from borrowers under our loan and preferred equity\ninvestments. Operating cash outflows consisted primarily of interest payments on borrowings and payment of general and\nadministrative expenses, including corporate overhead. Increases to operating cash flows primarily relate to completed\ninvestment activity, and decreases to operating cash flows primarily relate to disposition activity and interest expense from\nincreased borrowing activity and higher interest rates. In addition, the change in operating cash flows was impacted by the\ntiming of collections from our tenants and borrowers and fluctuations in the operating results of our Senior Housing - Managed\ncommunities. We expect our annualized cash flows provided by operating activities to fluctuate as a result of such activity.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $127.6 million and included\n$112.2 million used for the acquisition of three facilities, $39.2 million used for additions to real estate, $21.5 million used to\n36\nTable of Contents\nprovide funding for loans receivable, $2.5 million used to provide funding for a preferred equity investment and $0.7 million\nused for the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by $40.5 million in net proceeds from the sales of\nreal estate, $5.3 million in repayments of preferred equity investments and $2.8 million in repayments of loans receivable.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $80.6 million and included\n$209.2 million of dividends paid to stockholders, $1.5 million of principal repayments on secured debt and $0.1 million of\npayments of deferred financing costs related to the Credit Agreement, partially offset by $71.4 million of proceeds from shares\nsold through our ATM Program, net of related costs and payroll costs related to the issuance of common stock pursuant to\nequity compensation arrangements, and $58.8 million of net proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility.\nPlease see the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for details of our operating, investing and financing\ncash activities.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nSenior Unsecured Notes. Our senior unsecured notes consisted of the following (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nTitle Maturity Date Principal Balance (1)\n5.125% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) August 15, 2026 $ 500,000\n5.88% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) May 17, 2027 100,000\n3.90% senior unsecured notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) October 15, 2029 350,000\n3.20% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) December 1, 2031 800,000\n$ 1,750,000\n(1) Principal balance does not include discount, net of $4.8 million and deferred financing costs, net of $9.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\nSee Note 8, “Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and “Subsidiary Issuer and Guarantor Financial\nInformation” below for additional information concerning the Senior Notes, including information regarding the indentures and\nagreements governing the Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes Indentures”). As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance\nwith all applicable covenants under the Senior Notes Indentures.\nCredit Agreement. Effective January 4, 2023, the Operating Partnership and Sabra Canadian Holdings, LLC (together, the\n“Borrowers”), and the other parties thereto entered into a sixth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement (the “Credit\nAgreement”). The Credit Agreement includes a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), a\n$430.0 million U.S. dollar term loan and a CAD $150.0 million Canadian dollar term loan (collectively, the “Term Loans”).\nFurther, up to $350.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for borrowings in certain foreign currencies. The\nCredit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.75 billion, subject to\nterms and conditions.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of January 4, 2027, and includes two six-month extension options. The\nTerm Loans have a maturity date of January 4, 2028.\nThe obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries.\nSee Note 8, “Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Credit\nAgreement, including information regarding covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we were\nin compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nSecured Indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, eight of our properties held for investment were subject to secured\nindebtedness to third parties, and our secured debt consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nInterest Rate Type Principal Balance (1) Weighted Average Interest Rate Maturity Date\nMay 2031 -\nFixed Rate $ 46,623 2.85 % August 2051\n(1) Principal balance does not include deferred financing costs, net of $0.8 million as of September 30, 2024.\n37\nTable of Contents\nInterest. Our estimated interest and facility fee payments based on principal amounts of debt outstanding as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, applicable interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2024, and including the impact of interest rate swaps\nand collars are $31.6 million for the remainder of 2024, $106.5 million in 2025, $106.5 million in 2026, $66.1 million in 2027,\n$40.6 million in 2028 and $100.9 million thereafter.\nCapital and Other Expenditures and Funding Commitments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nour aggregate capital expenditures were $39.2 million and $63.8 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate\ncommitment for future capital and other expenditures related to facilities leased under triple-net operating leases was\napproximately $15 million, of which $12 million will directly result in incremental rental income, and approximately $5 million\nwill be spent over the next 12 months. We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our Senior Housing - Managed\ncommunities.\nIn addition, as of September 30, 2024, we have committed to provide up to $1.5 million of future funding related to two\nloan receivable investments.\nDividends. To maintain REIT status, we are required each year to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our annual\nREIT taxable income after certain adjustments. All distributions will be made by us at the discretion of our board of directors\nand will depend on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants (which include\nlimits on distributions by us), applicable law, and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe paid dividends of $209.2 million on our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. On\nOctober 31, 2024, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock. The dividend\nwill be paid on November 29, 2024 to common stockholders of record as of November 15, 2024.\nSubsidiary Issuer and Guarantor Financial Information. In connection with the Operating Partnership’s assumption of\nthe 2026 Notes, we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2026 Notes. The 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes are issued by\nthe Operating Partnership and guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, by us.\nThese guarantees are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and senior guarantees of us, as guarantor, and are\nunsecured. We conduct all of our business through and derive virtually all of our income from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our\nability to make required payments with respect to our indebtedness (including the Senior Notes) and other obligations depends\non the financial results and condition of our subsidiaries and our ability to receive funds from our subsidiaries.\nIn accordance with Regulation S-X, the following aggregate summarized financial information is provided for Sabra and\nthe Operating Partnership. This aggregate summarized financial information has been prepared from the books and records\nmaintained by us and the Operating Partnership. The aggregate summarized financial information does not include the\ninvestments in, nor the earnings from, subsidiaries other than the Operating Partnership and therefore is not necessarily\nindicative of the results of operations or financial position had the Operating Partnership operated as an independent entity.\nIntercompany transactions have been eliminated. The aggregate summarized balance sheet information as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023 and aggregate summarized statement of loss information for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal assets $ 86,948 $ 72,730\nTotal liabilities 2,336,978 2,272,119\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal revenues $ 851\nTotal expenses 113,086\nNet loss (112,403)\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants or obligors related to our investments are engaged in similar\nbusiness activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability\nto meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We regularly\nmonitor our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks.\n38\nTable of Contents\nManagement believes our current portfolio is reasonably diversified across healthcare related real estate and geographical\nlocation and does not contain any other significant concentration of credit risks. Our portfolio of 373 real estate properties held\nfor investment as of September 30, 2024 is diversified by location across the U.S. and Canada.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, no tenant relationship represented 10% or more of our total\nrevenues.\nSkilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 39.6% of our revenues was derived directly or indirectly from skilled\nnursing/transitional care facilities. Medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities for Medicare Part A services under the\nProspective Payment System (“PPS”), as implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and modified pursuant to\nsubsequent laws, most recently the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. PPS regulations predetermine a\npayment amount per patient, per day, based on a market basket index calculated for all covered costs.\nOn October 1, 2019, a case-mix classification system called the skilled nursing facility Patient-Driven Payment Model\n(“PDPM”) became effective pursuant to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) final rule. PDPM focuses on\nclinically relevant factors, rather than volume-based service, for determining Medicare payment. PDPM adjusts Medicare\npayments based on each aspect of a resident’s care, most notably for non-therapy ancillaries, which are items and services not\nrelated to the provision of therapy such as drugs and medical supplies, thereby more accurately addressing costs associated with\nmedically complex patients. It further adjusts the skilled nursing facility per diem payments to reflect varying costs throughout\nthe stay and incorporates safeguards against potential financial incentives to ensure that beneficiaries receive care consistent\nwith their unique needs and goals.\nOn July 31, 2023, CMS issued a final rule regarding fiscal year 2024 Medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities\nproviding an estimated net increase of 4.0% compared to fiscal year 2023 comprised of an increase as a result of an update to\nthe payment rates of 6.4% (which is based on (i) a market basket increase of 3.0% plus (ii) a market basket forecast error\nadjustment of 3.6% and less (iii) a productivity adjustment of 0.2%), partially offset by the second phase of the recalibrated\nPDPM parity adjustment of 2.3%. These figures do not incorporate any of the estimated value-based purchasing reductions for\nskilled nursing facilities. The new payment rates became effective on October 1, 2023.\nOn April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule that establishes minimum nurse staffing requirements for long-term care\nfacilities (the “Minimum Staffing Standards”). The Minimum Staffing Standards will require a total nurse staffing standard of\n3.48 hours per resident day (“HPRD”), which must include at least 0.55 HPRD of direct registered nurse care and 2.45 HPRD\nof direct nurse aide care. Facilities may use any combination of nurse staff (registered nurse, licensed practical nurse and\nlicensed vocational nurse, or nurse aide) to account for the additional 0.48 HPRD needed to comply with the total nurse staffing\nstandard. Additionally, the Minimum Staffing Standards will require facilities to meet new facility assessment requirements and\nhave a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide skilled nursing care. The Minimum Staffing\nStandards became effective on June 21, 2024, with a compliance deadline for the new facility assessment requirements of\nAugust 8, 2024 and a phase-in period consisting of three phases over three years for non-rural facilities and over five years for\nrural facilities for the staffing requirements. We believe the Minimum Staffing Standards, as implemented in its current form,\nwill exacerbate the staffing challenges already faced by our tenants. The Minimum Staffing Standards are currently being\nchallenged in federal court, however there can be no assurance that the outcome of such challenges will be favorable to us.\nOn July 31, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding fiscal year 2025 Medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities\nproviding an estimated net increase of 4.2% compared to fiscal year 2024 (comprised of (i) a market basket increase of 3.0%\nplus (ii) a market basket forecast error adjustment of 1.7% and less (iii) a productivity adjustment of 0.5%). These figures do\nnot incorporate any of the estimated value-based purchasing reductions for skilled nursing facilities. The new payment rates\nbecame effective on October 1, 2024. Additionally, the proposed rule expands the civil monetary penalties (“CMP”) that can be\nimposed for noncompliance to allow for more CMPs per instance and per day.\nITEM 3.

Any statements that do not relate to historical or\ncurrent facts or matters are forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of “expects,” “believes,” “intends,” “should” or\ncomparable terms or the negative thereof. Examples of forward-looking statements include all statements regarding our expectations regarding earnings growth; population\nand demand growth; and our other expectations regarding our future financial position, results of operations (including our earnings guidance for 2024, as well as the\nassumptions set forth therein), our expectations regarding Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement trends and rate increases, cash flows, liquidity, business strategy, growth\nopportunities, potential investments and dispositions, plans and objectives for future operations and capital raising activity. Our actual results may differ materially from those\nprojected or contemplated by our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, among others, the following: increased labor costs and historically low\nunemployment; increases in market interest rates and inflation; pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, and the related impact on our tenants, borrowers and senior\nhousing - managed communities; operational risks with respect to our senior housing - managed communities; competitive conditions in our industry; the loss of key\nmanagement personnel; uninsured or underinsured losses affecting our properties; potential impairment charges and adjustments related to the accounting of our assets; the\npotential variability of our reported rental and related revenues as a result of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases, as amended by subsequent ASUs; risks\nassociated with our investment in our unconsolidated joint ventures; catastrophic weather and other natural or man-made disasters, the effects of climate change on our\nproperties and a failure to implement sustainable and energy-efficient measures; increased operating costs and competition for our tenants, borrowers and senior housing -\nmanaged communities; increased healthcare regulation and enforcement; our tenants’ dependency on reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payor\nprograms; the effect of our tenants, operators or borrowers declaring bankruptcy or becoming insolvent; our ability to find replacement tenants and the impact of unforeseen\ncosts in acquiring new properties; the impact of litigation and rising insurance costs on the business of our tenants; the impact of required regulatory approvals of transfers of\nhealthcare properties; environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties we own; our tenants’, borrowers’ or operators’ failure to adhere to\napplicable privacy and data security laws, or a material breach of our or our tenants’, borrowers’ or operators’ information technology; our concentration in the healthcare\nproperty sector, particularly in skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and senior housing communities, which makes our profitability more vulnerable to a downturn in a\nspecific sector than if we were investing in multiple industries; the significant amount of and our ability to service our indebtedness; covenants in our debt agreements that may\nrestrict our ability to pay dividends, make investments, incur additional indebtedness and refinance indebtedness on favorable terms; adverse changes in our credit ratings; our\nability to make dividend distributions at expected levels; our ability to raise capital through equity and debt financings; changes and uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions\nand disruptions in the financial markets; risks associated with our ownership of property outside the U.S., including currency fluctuations; the relatively illiquid nature of real\nestate investments; our ability to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the federal tax laws; compliance with REIT requirements and certain tax and\ntax regulatory matters related to our status as a REIT; changes in tax laws and regulations affecting REITs; the ownership limits and takeover defenses in our governing\ndocuments and under Maryland law, which may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities; and the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws.\nAdditional information concerning risks and uncertainties that could affect our business can be found in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),\nincluding in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA is an important non-\nGAAP supplemental measure of operating performance.\nAnnualized Cash Net Operating Income (“Annualized Cash NOI”).* The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings\nmeasure. The Company considers Annualized Cash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate\nthe operating performance of its investments. The Company defines Annualized Cash NOI as Annualized Revenues less operating expenses and non-cash revenues\nand expenses. Annualized Cash NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nAnnualized Revenues. The annual contractual rental revenues under leases and interest and other income generated by the Company’s loans receivable and other\ninvestments based on amounts invested and applicable terms as of the end of the period presented. Annualized Revenues do not include tenant recoveries or\nadditional rents and are adjusted to reflect actual payments received related to the twelve months ended at the end of the respective period for leases no longer\naccounted for on an accrual basis.\nBehavioral Health. Includes behavioral hospitals that provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients with mental health conditions, chemical dependence or\nsubstance addictions and addiction treatment centers that provide treatment services for chemical dependence and substance addictions, which may include\ninpatient care, outpatient care, medical detoxification, therapy and counseling.\nCash Net Operating Income (“Cash NOI”).* The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company\nconsiders Cash NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of its\ninvestments. The Company defines Cash NOI as total revenues less operating expenses and non-cash revenues and expenses. Cash NOI excludes all other financial\nstatement amounts included in net income.\nConsolidated Debt. The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness as reported in\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Enterprise Value. The Company believes Consolidated Enterprise Value is an important measurement as it is a measure of a company’s value. The\nCompany calculates Consolidated Enterprise Value as market equity capitalization plus Consolidated Debt. Market equity capitalization is calculated as (i) the\nnumber of shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the period presented plus (ii) the number of\nshares of preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s preferred stock on the last day of the period presented. Consolidated Enterprise Value\nincludes the Company’s market equity capitalization and Consolidated Debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\nEBITDARM. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) for a particular facility accruing to the operator/tenant\nof the property (not the Company), for the period presented. The Company uses EBITDARM in determining EBITDARM Coverage. EBITDARM has limitations as an\nanalytical tool. EBITDARM does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments. In\naddition, EBITDARM does not represent a property’s net income or cash flows from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators. The\nCompany utilizes EBITDARM to evaluate the core operations of the properties by eliminating management fees, which may vary by operator/tenant and operating\nstructure, and as a supplemental measure of the ability of the Company’s operators/tenants and relevant guarantors to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related\nobligations to the Company.\nEBITDARM Coverage. Represents the ratio of EBITDARM to cash rent for owned facilities (excluding Senior Housing - Managed communities) for the period presented.\nEBITDARM Coverage is a supplemental measure of a property’s ability to generate cash flows for the operator/tenant (not the Company) to meet the operator’s/\ntenant’s related cash rent and other obligations to the Company. However, its usefulness is limited by, among other things, the same factors that limit the usefulness\nof EBITDARM. EBITDARM Coverage includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nOctober 31, 2024 Investor Presentation 30\nAPPENDIX\nDefinitions\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted FFO (“AFFO”).* The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure.\nThe Company also believes that funds from operations, or FFO, as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (“Nareit”), and adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO (and related per share amounts) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of the\nCompany’s operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on\nland), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically\nrisen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for\ndepreciation could be less informative. Thus, Nareit created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that\nexcludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in\naccordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and the Company’s share of gains or losses from real estate dispositions related to its\nunconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests, plus the Company’s share of\ndepreciation and amortization related to its unconsolidated joint ventures, and real estate impairment charges of both consolidated and unconsolidated entities\nwhen the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding stock-based\ncompensation expense, non-cash rental and related revenues, non-cash interest income, non-cash interest expense, non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of\ndebt, provision for (recovery of) loan losses and other reserves, non-cash lease termination income and deferred income taxes, as well as other non-cash revenue\nand expense items (including noncapitalizable acquisition costs, transaction costs related to operator transitions and organizational or other restructuring activities,\nineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests) and the Company’s share of\nnon-cash adjustments related to its unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the use of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts),\ncombined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of the Company’s operating results among investors and makes comparisons of\noperating results among real estate investment trusts more meaningful. The Company considers FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative\noperating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare the operating\nperformance of the Company between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating\nperformance of real estate investment trusts, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an\nalternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital\nexpenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements.\nFurther, the Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO\nin accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition or define AFFO differently than the Company does.\nNet Debt.* The principal balances of the Company’s revolving credit facility, term loans, senior unsecured notes, and secured indebtedness as reported in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements, net of cash and cash equivalents as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA.* Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net Debt divided by Annualized Adjusted EBITDA, which is Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted for\nannualizing adjustments that give effect to the acquisitions and dispositions completed during the respective period as though such acquisitions and dispositions\nwere completed as of the beginning of the period presented.\nNet Operating Income (“NOI”)* The Company believes that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. The Company considers NOI\nan important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of its investments. The\nCompany defines NOI as total revenues less operating expenses. NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income.\nOctober 31, 2024 Investor Presentation 31\nAPPENDIX\nDefinitions\nNormalized FFO and Normalized AFFO.* Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO represent FFO and AFFO, respectively, adjusted for certain income and expense items\nthat the Company does not believe are indicative of its ongoing operating results. The Company considers Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO to be useful\nmeasures to evaluate the Company’s operating results excluding these income and expense items to help investors compare the operating performance of the\nCompany between periods or as compared to other companies. Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as\ndefined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the Company’s liquidity or operating performance. Normalized FFO\nand Normalized AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the Company’s real estate assets nor do they purport to be\nindicative of cash available to fund the Company’s future cash requirements. Further, the Company’s computation of Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO may not\nbe comparable to Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit\ndefinition or that interpret the current Nareit definition or define FFO and AFFO or Normalized FFO and Normalized AFFO differently than the Company does.\nOccupancy Percentage. Occupancy Percentage represents the facilities’ average operating occupancy for the period indicated. The percentages are calculated by\ndividing the actual census from the period presented by the available beds/units for the same period. Occupancy includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes\nfacilities for which data is not available or meaningful.\nSenior Housing. Senior Housing communities include independent living, assisted living, continuing care retirement and memory care communities.\nSenior Housing - Managed. Senior Housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements.\nSkilled Mix. Skilled Mix is defined as the total Medicare and non-Medicaid managed care patient revenue at Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities divided by the\ntotal revenues at Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities for the period indicated. Skilled Mix includes only Stabilized Facilities and excludes facilities for which data\nis not available or meaningful.\nSkilled Nursing/Transitional Care. Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care facilities include skilled nursing, transitional care, multi-license designation and mental health\nfacilities.\nSpecialty Hospitals and Other. Includes acute care, long-term acute care and rehabilitation hospitals, facilities that provide residential services, which may include\nassistance with activities of daily living, and other facilities not classified as Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care, Senior Housing or Behavioral Health.\nStabilized Facility. At the time of acquisition, the Company classifies each facility as either stabilized or non-stabilized. In addition, the Company may classify a facility\nas non-stabilized after acquisition. Circumstances that could result in a facility being classified as non-stabilized include newly completed developments, facilities\nundergoing major renovations or additions, facilities being repositioned or transitioned to new operators, and significant transitions within the tenants’ business\nmodel. Such facilities are typically reclassified to stabilized upon the earlier of maintaining consistent performance or 24 months after the date of classification as\nnon-stabilized. Stabilized Facilities generally exclude (i) facilities held for sale, (ii) strategic disposition candidates, (iii) facilities being transitioned to a new operator,\n(iv) facilities being transitioned from being leased by the Company to being operated by the Company and (v) leased facilities acquired during the three months\npreceding the period presented.\n* Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Reconciliations, definitions and important discussions regarding the usefulness and limitations of the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nused in this presentation can be found at https://ir.sabrahealth.com/investors/financials/quarterly-results.\nOctober 31, 2024 Investor Presentation 32"

These proxy materials are first being sent or made available to\nour stockholders on or about April 26, 2024.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING INTERNET\nAVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS\nThis Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023\n(“2023 Annual Report”) are posted in the Investors—Financials section of our website at\nwww.sabrahealth.com.

On or about April 26, 2024, we mailed to each of our stockholders (other than those\nwho previously requested electronic delivery or to whom we are mailing a paper copy of the proxy\nmaterials) a Notice of Internet Availability containing instructions on how to access and review the\nproxy materials via the Internet and how to submit a proxy electronically using the Internet. The\nNotice of Internet Availability also contains instructions on how to receive, free of charge, paper\ncopies of the proxy materials. If you received the Notice of Internet Availability, you will not receive\na paper copy of the proxy materials unless you request one.\nWe believe the delivery options that we have chosen will allow us to provide our stockholders with\nthe proxy materials they need, while lowering the cost of the delivery of the materials and reducing\nthe environmental impact of printing and mailing paper copies.\n1\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nQ: What items will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?\nA: The items of business scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are:\n(cid:129) the election of eight nominees to the Board of Directors to serve until the 2025 annual meeting\nof stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal\nNo. 1);\n(cid:129) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as Sabra’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024\n(Proposal No. 2); and\n(cid:129) the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (as\nhereinafter defined) (Proposal No. 3).\nWe will also consider any other business that properly comes before the Annual Meeting or any\nadjournments or postponements thereof. See “—How will voting on any other business be\nconducted?” below.\nQ: How does the Board recommend I vote on these items?\nA: The Board of Directors recommends that you vote your shares:\n(cid:129) FOR the election to the Board of Directors of each of the following eight nominees: Craig A.\nBarbarosh, Katie Cusack, Michael J. Foster, Lynne S. Katzmann, Ann Kono, Jeffrey A.\nMalehorn, Richard K. Matros and Clifton J. Porter II (Proposal No. 1);\n(cid:129) FOR the ratification of the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public\naccounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 (Proposal No. 2); and\n(cid:129) FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers\n(Proposal No. 3).\nQ: Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nA: The record date for the Annual Meeting is the close of business on April 16, 2024. Stockholders of\nrecord of Sabra’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “common stock”), as of the close\nof business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting.\nQ: What options are available to me to vote my shares?\nA: Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or through a bank, broker or other\nnominee (that is, in “street name”), your shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting by following\nany of the voting options available to you below:\nYou may authorize a proxy to vote via the Internet.\n(1) If you received a Notice of Internet Availability or a copy of the proxy materials electronically\nby email, you can submit your proxy or voting instructions over the Internet by following the\ninstructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability or the electronic copy of the proxy\nmaterials you received; or\n2\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\n(2) If you received a printed set of the proxy materials by mail, including a paper copy of the\nproxy card or voting instruction form, you may submit your proxy or voting instructions over\nthe Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction form, as\napplicable.\nYou may authorize a proxy to vote via telephone. If you are a stockholder of record, you can\nsubmit your proxy by calling the telephone number specified on the paper copy of the proxy card\nyou received if you received a printed set of the proxy materials. You must have the control\nnumber that appears on your proxy card available when submitting your proxy over the telephone.\nMost stockholders who hold their shares in street name may submit voting instructions by calling\nthe telephone number specified on the voting instruction form provided by their bank, broker or\nother nominee. Those stockholders should check the voting instruction form for telephone voting\navailability.\nYou may authorize a proxy to vote by mail. If you received a printed set of the proxy materials, you\nmay submit your proxy or voting instructions by completing and signing the separate proxy card or\nvoting instruction form you received and mailing it in the accompanying prepaid and addressed\nenvelope.\nYou may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders of record may vote in person at\nthe Annual Meeting. Written ballots will be passed out to anyone who wants to vote at the Annual\nMeeting. However, if you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name through a bank,\nbroker or other nominee, you may not vote your shares at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a\n“legal proxy” from the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to\nvote the shares at the Annual Meeting.\nEven if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy or voting\ninstructions in advance to authorize the voting of your shares at the Annual Meeting so that your\nvote will be counted if you later are unable to attend the Annual Meeting.\nQ: What is the deadline for voting my shares?\nA: If you are a stockholder of record, your proxy must be received by telephone or the Internet by\n11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 12, 2024 in order for your shares to be voted at the Annual\nMeeting. However, if you are a stockholder of record and you received a copy of the proxy\nmaterials by mail, you may instead mark, sign and date the proxy card you received and return it in\nthe accompanying prepaid and addressed envelope so that it is received by Sabra before voting\nbegins at the Annual Meeting in order for your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting. If you\nhold your shares in street name, please provide your voting instructions by the deadline specified\nby the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares.\nQ: Once I have submitted my proxy, is it possible for me to change or revoke my proxy?\nA: Yes. Any stockholder of record has the power to change or revoke a previously submitted proxy at\nany time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by:\n(cid:129) submitting to our Secretary, before the voting begins at the Annual Meeting, a written notice of\nrevocation bearing a later date than the proxy;\n3\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\n(cid:129) properly submitting a proxy on a later date prior to the deadlines specified in “—What is the\ndeadline for voting my shares?” above (only the latest proxy submitted by a stockholder by\nInternet, telephone or mail will be counted); or\n(cid:129) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person; attendance at the Annual Meeting will not\nby itself constitute a revocation of a proxy.\nFor shares held in street name, you may revoke any previous voting instructions by submitting new\nvoting instructions to the bank, broker or other nominee holding your shares by the deadline for\nvoting specified in the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee.\nAlternatively, if your shares are held in street name, you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote\nin person, which will revoke any previous voting instructions you submitted.\nQ: How many shares are eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting?\nA: As of the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2024, there were 231,495,570 shares of\ncommon stock outstanding and eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting. There is no other class of\nvoting securities outstanding. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote at the\nAnnual Meeting.\nQ: How is a quorum determined?\nA: A quorum refers to the number of shares that must be in attendance at an annual meeting of\nstockholders to lawfully conduct business. The representation, in person or by proxy, of holders\nentitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting constitutes a\nquorum at the Annual Meeting. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether a\nquorum exists for the Annual Meeting if you returned a signed and dated proxy card or voting\ninstruction form, if you submitted your proxy or voting instructions by telephone or the Internet, or if\nyou vote in person at the Annual Meeting, even if you abstain from voting on any of the proposals.\nIn addition, if you are a street name holder, your shares may also be counted for purposes of\ndetermining whether a quorum exists for the Annual Meeting even if you do not submit voting\ninstructions to your broker. See “—How will votes be counted at the Annual Meeting?” below.\nQ: What is required to approve each proposal at the Annual Meeting?\nA: Election of Directors (Proposal No. 1). Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) provide for a\nmajority voting standard for the election of directors. Under this majority voting standard, once a\nquorum has been established, each director nominee receiving a majority of the votes cast with\nrespect to his or her election (that is, the number of votes cast FOR the nominee exceeds the\nnumber of votes cast AGAINST the nominee) will be elected as a director. As required by our\nBylaws, each incumbent director has submitted an irrevocable letter of resignation that becomes\neffective if the director is not elected by stockholders in an uncontested election and the Board of\nDirectors accepts the resignation. The majority voting standard does not apply, however, in a\ncontested election where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be\nelected. In such circumstances, directors will instead be elected by a plurality of the votes cast,\nmeaning that the persons receiving the highest number of FOR votes, up to the total number of\ndirectors to be elected at the meeting, will be elected. The majority voting standard is discussed\nfurther under the section entitled “Election of Directors (Proposal No. 1)—Majority Voting\nStandard.”\n4\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nThe election of directors at the Annual Meeting is not contested. Therefore, in accordance with the\nmajority voting standard, director nominees will be elected at the Annual Meeting by a majority of\nthe votes cast. Stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their shares for the purpose of electing\ndirectors.\nOther Items (Proposal Nos. 2 and 3). Once a quorum has been established, pursuant to our\nBylaws, approval of each of the other items to be submitted for a vote of stockholders at the\nAnnual Meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all of the votes cast on the proposal at\nthe Annual Meeting.\nNotwithstanding this vote standard required by our Bylaws, Proposal No. 2 (ratification of the\nappointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024) and Proposal No. 3 (advisory approval of named executive officer\ncompensation) are advisory only and are not binding on Sabra. Our Board of Directors will\nconsider the outcome of the vote on each of these items in considering what action, if any, should\nbe taken in response to the vote by stockholders.\nQ: How will votes be counted at the Annual Meeting?\nA: In the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN with\nrespect to each director nominee. For the proposals to ratify the appointment of PwC as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024\n(Proposal No. 2) and the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 3), you may vote\nFOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. Abstentions with respect to any proposal at the Annual Meeting will\nbe counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum,\nbut will not be counted as a vote cast on the proposal and therefore will not be counted in\ndetermining the outcome of any of the proposals.\nIf you hold your shares in street name through a brokerage account and you do not submit voting\ninstructions to your broker, your broker may generally vote your shares in its discretion on routine\nmatters. However, a broker cannot vote shares held in street name on non-routine matters unless\nthe broker receives voting instructions from the street name holder. The proposal to ratify the\nappointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024 (Proposal No. 2) is expected to be considered routine under applicable rules,\nwhile each of the other items to be submitted for a vote of stockholders at the Annual Meeting is\nconsidered non-routine. Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name through a brokerage\naccount and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, your broker may exercise its\ndiscretion to vote your shares on Proposal No. 2, but will not be permitted to vote your shares on\nany of the other items at the Annual Meeting. If your broker exercises this discretion, your shares\nwill be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual\nMeeting and will be voted on Proposal No. 2 in the manner directed by your broker, but your\nshares will constitute “broker non-votes” on Proposals No. 1 and 3. Broker non-votes will not be\ncounted as a vote cast with respect to Proposals No. 1 and 3 and therefore will not be counted in\ndetermining the outcome of those proposals. You should instruct your broker or nominee how to\nvote your shares by following the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee.\n5\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nQ: How will my shares be voted if I do not give specific voting instructions in the proxy or\nvoting instructions I submit?\nA: If you properly submit a proxy or voting instructions but do not indicate your specific voting\ninstructions on one or more of the items listed above in the Notice of Annual Meeting, your shares\nwill be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors on those items. See “—How does the\nBoard recommend I vote on these items?” above.\nQ: How will voting on any other business be conducted?\nA: Although the Board of Directors does not know of any business to be considered at the Annual\nMeeting other than the items described in this Proxy Statement, if any other business properly\ncomes before the Annual Meeting, a stockholder’s properly submitted proxy gives authority to the\nproxy holders named in the proxies solicited by the Board of Directors to vote on those matters in\ntheir discretion.\nQ: Who will bear the costs of the solicitation of proxies?\nA: The cost of preparing the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, this Proxy Statement, the\nNotice of Internet Availability and the form of proxy, the cost of mailing such materials to\nstockholders or making them available on the Internet and the cost of soliciting proxies will be paid\nby Sabra. In addition to solicitation by mail, certain officers, regular employees and directors of\nSabra, without receiving any additional compensation, may solicit proxies personally or by\ntelephone. Sabra will request brokerage houses, banks and other custodians or nominees holding\nstock in their names for others to forward proxy materials to their customers or principals who are\nthe beneficial owners of shares of our common stock and will reimburse them for their expenses in\ndoing so.\nQ: Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?\nA: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and disclose final voting\nresults in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days\nfollowing the Annual Meeting.\n6\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL\nSTOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of common stock\nas of March 31, 2024 for the following: (i) each of Sabra’s directors and each executive officer of Sabra\nidentified as a “Named Executive Officer” in this Proxy Statement, (ii) all persons who are current\ndirectors and executive officers of Sabra as a group and (iii) any person who is known by Sabra to be\nthe beneficial owner of more than 5% of Sabra’s outstanding common stock.

The Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines direct our Board’s actions with respect to, among other things, Board\ncomposition and director qualifications, selection of the Chair of the Board and the Lead Independent\nDirector, composition of the Board’s standing committees, stockholder communications with the Board,\nsuccession planning and the Board’s annual performance evaluation.\n20\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines underscore our focus on diversity, by explicitly stating that the\nBoard of Directors and the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee are committed to\nactively seeking qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which\nnew Board members or director nominees are selected.\nA current copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is posted in the Investors—Governance\nsection of our website at www.sabrahealth.com.\nPolicy on Director Time Commitments\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our policy on director time commitments, which seeks\nto ensure that directors have sufficient time available to devote to Sabra’s affairs, including in light of\nthe director’s other positions and/or service on other public company boards. The policy provides that\ndirectors may not simultaneously serve on more than three other public company boards (except with\nthe prior approval of the chair of the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee); directors\nwho also serve as chief executive officers, or in equivalent positions, should not serve on more than\none other public company board; and members of our Audit Committee may not simultaneously serve\non the audit committees of more than two other public companies (except with the prior approval of our\nBoard). Our Corporate Governance Guidelines further provide that directors should advise the Chair of\nthe Board and the Chair of the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee in advance of\naccepting an invitation to serve on another board and should only serve on other boards if they have\nsufficient time to devote to Sabra’s affairs. Our directors’ outside board commitments are evaluated\nbased on written responses to annual directors’ and officers’ questionnaires. All directors are currently\nin compliance with our policy on director time commitments, and the Board has not granted any\nexceptions to the policy.\nStockholder Engagement\nOur Board of Directors and management value the input of our stockholders and prioritize engaging\nwith our stockholders to directly receive their feedback. Our Board and management considers and\nevaluates the feedback and insights from our stockholder engagement, in addition to emerging best\npractices, policies at other companies and market standards, to enhance the evolution of our\ndisclosures and practices.\nDirector Independence\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a substantial majority of our Board of Directors\nqualify as “independent directors” under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the\n“Nasdaq rules”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC. In considering the independence of each\ndirector, the Board of Directors reviews information provided by each director and considers whether\nany director has a relationship that would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent judgment\nin carrying out his responsibilities as a director. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined\nthat none of Messrs. Barbarosh, Foster, Malehorn or Porter nor Mses. Cusack, Katzmann or Kono has\na relationship that, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the director’s exercise\n21\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nof independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director and that each such\ndirector is an independent director under the Nasdaq rules. Mr. Matros does not qualify as an\nindependent director because he is employed as our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nProxy Access\nOur Board of Directors has implemented a proxy access provision in our Bylaws, which permits a\nstockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock\ncontinuously for at least three years, to nominate and require us to include in our proxy materials for an\nannual meeting of stockholders director candidates constituting up to 25% of the Board of Directors\n(rounded down to the nearest whole number, but not less than two), provided that the stockholder(s)\nand the nominee(s) satisfy the eligibility and procedural requirements described in our Bylaws.

In addition, each member of the Audit Committee is also\n“independent” under Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”), and satisfies the additional financial literacy requirements of the Nasdaq rules. The\nBoard has designated two members of the Audit Committee, Mr. Foster and Ms. Kono, as “audit\ncommittee financial experts” as defined by SEC rules. The Board based its determination on the\nqualifications and business experience of each of Mr. Foster and Ms. Kono described above under\n“Board of Directors and Executive Officers—Directors of the Company.”\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing Sabra’s accounting and financial reporting\nprocesses and the audit of Sabra’s financial statements, including the integrity of Sabra’s financial\nstatements, the qualifications and independence of Sabra’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm and the performance of Sabra’s independent registered public accounting firm and internal\nauditors. Among other things, the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation\nand retention of Sabra’s independent registered public accounting firm; pre-approval of all audit and\nnon-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm; review of\nSabra’s internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures; oversight of Sabra’s internal audit\nfunction; oversight of Sabra’s legal and regulatory compliance and risk assessment and risk\nmanagement policies; review of Sabra’s risk exposure in the areas of information and cyber security;\nand review and approval of any related party transactions. The Audit Committee is also responsible for\npreparing the Audit Committee Report included in this Proxy Statement. In performing its\nresponsibilities, the Audit Committee meets regularly with management, Sabra’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm and Sabra’s internal auditors.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee is an\n“independent director” under the Nasdaq rules. In making the determination regarding the\nindependence of each member of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors considered\nwhether the director has a relationship with Sabra that is material to the director’s ability to be\nindependent from management in connection with the duties of a member of the Compensation\nCommittee.\nThe Compensation Committee oversees and determines the compensation of Sabra’s Chief Executive\nOfficer and other executive officers, including salaries, bonuses and awards of equity-based\ncompensation, approves all employment and severance agreements for executive officers, makes\nrecommendations to the Board with respect to the adoption or amendment of incentive compensation\nplans and stock-based benefit plans, administers Sabra’s stock-based benefit plans, reviews and\noversees the administration of any compensation “clawback” or similar policy and makes\nrecommendations to the Board of Directors concerning the compensation of directors. The\nCompensation Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nincluded in this Proxy Statement and for preparing the Compensation Committee Report included in\nthis Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee is further responsible for periodically reviewing\nhuman capital management matters, including Sabra’s policies, programs and initiatives focusing on\nCompany culture, talent development, employee retention, diversity, equity and inclusion and\nemployee health, wellness and safety.\n23\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nThe Compensation Committee is solely responsible for making the final decisions on compensation for\nSabra’s executive officers. However, the Compensation Committee takes into account\nrecommendations of Sabra’s Chief Executive Officer in determining the compensation (including stock\nawards) of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. Otherwise, Sabra’s officers do not\nhave any role in determining the form or amount of compensation paid to the executive officers of\nSabra. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains the power to appoint and delegate matters to\na subcommittee comprised of at least one member of the Compensation Committee, except that the\nCompensation Committee may not delegate to a subcommittee any power or authority required by any\nlaw, regulation or listing standard to be exercised by the Compensation Committee as a whole. The\nCompensation Committee does not currently intend to delegate any of its responsibilities to a\nsubcommittee.\nPursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee is authorized to retain compensation consultants\nto assist in the evaluation of compensation to Sabra’s executive officers. As further described under\n“Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis” below, since our becoming a\nseparate publicly traded company, the Compensation Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook &\nCompany, Inc. (“FW Cook”) as its independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation\nCommittee with the design and structure of our executive compensation program and the amounts\npayable thereunder. The Compensation Committee is directly responsible for the appointment,\ncompensation and oversight of FW Cook’s work, and does not believe FW Cook’s work has raised any\nconflicts of interest. FW Cook reports only to the Compensation Committee and does not perform\nservices for us, except for executive compensation-related services on behalf of, and as instructed by,\nthe Compensation Committee. All compensation decisions were made solely by our Compensation\nCommittee.\nCorporate Responsibility and Governance Committee\nThe Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Corporate Responsibility and\nGovernance Committee is an “independent director” under the Nasdaq rules.\nAs further described below under “—Director Nomination Process,” the Corporate Responsibility and\nGovernance Committee assists our Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become\nBoard members and selecting the director nominees for each annual meeting of stockholders. The\nCorporate Responsibility and Governance Committee also makes recommendations to the Board of\nDirectors concerning the structure and operations of the Board and its committees and is responsible\nfor overseeing the Corporate Governance Guidelines, for developing and recommending to the Board\nof Directors any changes to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, for overseeing and monitoring the\nCompany’s policy on director time commitments contained therein, for overseeing new director\norientation and director continuing education, for receiving reports annually from the Chief Executive\nOfficer concerning senior management development and succession plans, and for overseeing the\nCompany’s human capital and environmental, social and governance policies and practices including,\nwithout limitation, related to climate-related risks.\nMeetings and Attendance\nDuring 2023, our Board of Directors held four meetings. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of\nthe aggregate meetings of the Board and the committees of the Board on which the director served\n24\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nduring 2023. In addition, the independent directors meet regularly in executive session without the\npresence of management. Mr. Foster, who has been designated by the independent directors as Lead\nIndependent Director, chairs these executive sessions of the independent directors.\nOur Board of Directors encourages each director to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All of\nour directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in person or by remote communication.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board is free to make its choice for Chair and\nChief Executive Officer in any way that the Board of Directors considers best for Sabra at a given point\nin time. Accordingly, the Chair and Chief Executive Officer positions may be filled by one individual or\nby two different individuals. The Board believes that the appropriate leadership structure for Sabra at\nthis time is for Mr. Matros to serve as both our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, in concert with an\nindependent director serving as our Lead Independent Director.\nOur Board of Directors believes that Mr. Matros, our Chief Executive Officer, is best suited to serve as\nour Chair because he is the director most familiar with Sabra’s business and industry and most capable\nof identifying strategic priorities. In the Board’s view, combining the roles of Chair and Chief Executive\nOfficer facilitates the flow of information between management and the Board, and helps assure that the\nstrategies adopted by the Board will be best positioned for execution by management. While the Chair\nleads the Board in overseeing the management and direction of the Company, any specific actions\ntaken in connection with this oversight responsibility are exercised by the full Board or any Board\ncommittee to which authority has been delegated by the Board, and not by any individual director.\nTo promote the independence of the Board and appropriate oversight of management and to\ndemonstrate our commitment to strong corporate governance, the independent directors designate\nannually an independent, non-employee director to serve as our Lead Independent Director. As noted\nabove, the independent directors have currently designated Mr. Foster to serve as our Lead\nIndependent Director. The Lead Independent Director helps to facilitate free and open discussion and\ncommunication among the independent directors of the Board and between the Board and\nmanagement. The duties of the Lead Independent Director include chairing all meetings of the\nindependent directors when they meet in executive session and chairing all meetings of the full Board\nin the absence of the Chair; representing the Board in meetings with third parties, as appropriate; and\nworking with the Chair to finalize meeting agendas, meeting schedules and other information provided\nto the Board. The Lead Independent Director also sets the agenda for the meetings held in executive\nsession and discusses issues that arise from these meetings with the Chief Executive Officer. The\nnon-employee members of the Board meet in executive session during each regularly scheduled\nBoard meeting and during special meetings of the Board, as appropriate.\nRisk Oversight\nOne of the principal functions of our Board of Directors is to provide oversight concerning the\nassessment and management of risk related to our business. The Board of Directors is involved in risk\noversight through approval authority with respect to fundamental financial and business strategies and\nmajor corporate activities, including material acquisitions and financings, as well as through its\noversight of management and the committees of the Board of Directors. As part of overseeing our\n25\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\ncorporate strategy and our enterprise risk management program, our Board of Directors also monitors\nour environmental practices, sustainability, including climate-related risks, and human capital\nmanagement. Any director may propose a meeting agenda item related to risk or any other topic for\nconsideration and discussion by the Board.\nManagement is responsible for identifying the material short-, intermediate- and long-term risks facing\nSabra implementing appropriate risk management strategies and ensuring that information with\nrespect to material risks is shared with the Board of Directors or the appropriate Board committee. In\nconnection with this responsibility, members of management provide regular reports to the Board of\nDirectors regarding business operations and strategic planning, financial planning and budgeting,\nregulatory matters and information systems and cybersecurity, including any material risk to Sabra\nrelating to such matters. The Board of Directors considers and makes determinations on any action\nwarranted with respect to these risks, which include short-, intermediate- and long-term risks, as well\nas both existing risks and emerging risks. The Board’s oversight standards apply regardless of the\nimmediacy of the risk assessed, and risks are reevaluated regularly.\nWhere appropriate, the Board of Directors also receives input on risk-related topics from third-party\nadvisors and experts who report from time to time to the Board on various risk topics within their area\nof expertise, including with respect to potential future threats and trends. Management also annually\nconducts an enterprise-wide risk assessment with the assistance of an external firm to evaluate the\nrisks facing Sabra and determine their severity, likelihood of occurring in a single year, how quickly\nSabra may be impacted by each risk and the perceived effectiveness of management’s current\nmitigation activities and controls. The results of this enterprise-wide risk assessment are reviewed by\nthe Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and shared with the rest of the Board, and considered by\noutside advisors in connection with the assessment of the material risk factors to disclose in our filings\nwith the SEC.\nThe Board of Directors has delegated oversight for specific areas of risk exposure to committees of the\nBoard of Directors as follows:\n(cid:129) The Audit Committee is responsible for periodically discussing Sabra’s overall risk assessment\nand risk management policies as well as Sabra’s plans to monitor, control and minimize any\nrisk exposure with management, our internal auditors and our independent registered public\naccounting firm. In addition, the Audit Committee periodically reviews Sabra’s risk exposure\nrelated to the Audit Committee’s areas of responsibility, including financial reporting, disclosure\ncontrols and procedures, accounting and internal controls, legal and regulatory compliance\nand information and cyber security. The Audit Committee is also responsible for primary risk\noversight related to our financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, accounting and\ninternal controls and oversees risks related to our compliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements.\n(cid:129) The Compensation Committee oversees, among other things, the assessment and\nmanagement of risks related to Sabra’s compensation plans, policies and overall philosophy,\nequity-based incentive plans, and human capital matters, including Sabra’s culture, talent\ndevelopment, employee retention, diversity, equity and inclusion and employee health,\nwellness and safety.\n(cid:129) The Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee oversees the assessment and\nmanagement of risks related to our governance structure, including our Board leadership\nstructure and management and director succession, as well as our human capital and\nenvironmental, social and governance policies and practices.\n26\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nAll members of our Board of Directors are invited to attend our regularly scheduled committee\nmeetings, and most directors do so attend. Our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and\noutside legal counsel also regularly attend meetings of our standing committees when they are not in\nexecutive session, and often report on matters that may not be otherwise addressed at these\nmeetings. In addition, our directors are encouraged to communicate directly with members of\nmanagement regarding matters of interest, including matters related to risk, at times when meetings\nare not being held.\nOur Board of Directors believes that the processes it has established to administer the Board’s risk\noversight function would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not\nhave a material effect on Sabra’s leadership structure described under “—Board Leadership Structure”\nabove.\nCompensation Risk Assessment\nConsistent with the Compensation Committee’s responsibilities described above, the Compensation\nCommittee takes risk into consideration when reviewing and approving executive compensation,\nincluding when it approved our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee has\nconcluded that the current executive compensation program does not encourage inappropriate or\nexcessive risk-taking. In making its determination, the Compensation Committee noted that each\nNamed Executive Officer’s direct compensation under our executive compensation program consists\nprimarily of a fixed base salary, an annual incentive bonus opportunity and long-term equity incentive\nawards. Long-term incentive awards granted under our long-term equity award program are generally\nsubject to a multi-year vesting schedule, a deferral feature for Named Executive Officers and\nperformance conditions that are not solely dependent on stock price.\nDirector Nomination Process\nIdentifying and Evaluating Director Nominee Candidates\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting potential director nominees for election at each annual meeting\nof stockholders and nominees for directors to be appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies\nand newly created directorships, the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee will\nconsider as potential director nominees candidates recommended by various sources, including any\nmember of the Board, any stockholder of Sabra, senior management or an outside search firm\nengaged by the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee if determined appropriate. All\npotential director nominees, other than potential incumbent director nominees, will be initially reviewed\nby the Chair of the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee or, in the Chair’s absence,\nany other member of the committee delegated to initially review director candidates. If it is determined\nappropriate to proceed, a prospective director candidate may be interviewed by one or more of the\nother members of the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee, other members of the\nBoard of Directors and by the Chief Executive Officer. The Corporate Responsibility and Governance\nCommittee will provide informal progress updates to the Board of Directors and will meet to consider\nand recommend any final director candidates to the full Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is\nresponsible for determining the final director candidates to be nominated for election at each annual\nmeeting of stockholders and for appointing directors to fill vacancies on the Board.\n27\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nIn considering whether to nominate a potential director candidate for election to the Board of Directors,\nthe Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee considers whether the director candidate\nwould meet the definition of independence required by the Nasdaq rules and applicable rules and\nregulations of the SEC. As set forth in Sabra’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee also seeks to elect directors who: (i) are of high character\nand integrity; (ii) are accomplished in their respective fields; (iii) have relevant expertise and\nexperience, and are able to offer advice and guidance to management based on that expertise and\nexperience; (iv) have sufficient time available to devote to Sabra’s affairs, including whether the\ndirector candidate would satisfy Sabra’s policy on director time commitments as set forth in its\nCorporate Governance Guidelines; (v) will represent the long-term interests of Sabra’s stockholders as\na whole; (vi) are not age 80 or older at the time of election; and (vii) will collectively represent a\ndiversity of backgrounds and experiences, including diversity with respect to gender, age and ethnicity.\nOur Board of Directors and the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee are committed to\nactively seeking qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which\nnew Board members or director nominees are selected. The Board of Directors and the Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee evaluate each individual in the context of the Board as a\nwhole, with the objective of building a Board that is effective, collegial and can best represent the\ninterests of Sabra and its stockholders, using its diversity of backgrounds and experiences. On an\nannual basis, as part of the performance evaluation of the Board of Directors, the Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee seeks feedback from members of the Board of Directors\nconcerning whether the overall mix and diversity of Board members is appropriate for the Company.\nStockholder Recommendations\nAs described above, the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee will consider director\ncandidates recommended by stockholders.

In\nperforming these functions, the Chief Executive Officer annually reports to the Corporate Responsibility\nand Governance Committee about developments of senior management personnel and succession\nplans. All members of our Board of Directors are invited to attend our regularly scheduled Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee meetings, and most directors do so attend and have the\nopportunity to review and discuss the succession plans.\nAnnual Board Evaluations\nPursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charter of the Corporate Responsibility and\nGovernance Committee, the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee oversees an annual\nevaluation of the performance of the Board and each committee of the Board. The evaluation process\nis facilitated by outside legal counsel and is designed to assess the overall effectiveness of the Board\nand its committees and to identify opportunities for improving Board and Board committee operations\nand procedures.

Accordingly, our Board has incorporated prohibitions on various hedging activities within\nSabra’s Insider Trading Policy, which applies to all directors, executive officers and employees. The\npolicy prohibits short sales of shares of common stock and trading in “puts” and “calls” or other\nderivative securities that relate to common stock. The policy also prohibits hedging or monetization\ntransactions (such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are\ndesigned to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Sabra securities.\nIn addition, because a margin call or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when a director, executive\nofficer or employee is aware of material non-public information concerning Sabra, directors, executive\nofficers and employees are prohibited from holding Sabra securities in a margin account or pledging\nSabra securities as collateral for a loan. Accordingly, none of our directors or executive officers have\npledged any shares of common stock.\nCode of Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and\nemployees.

Costa\nChief Financial Officer, Secretary\nand Executive Vice President\n31\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\nINITIATIVES\nSustainability Initiatives\nAt Sabra, we take a care-driven approach to our business. We invest in assets where the future of\nhealthcare is being delivered and where leading operators are skillfully and compassionately caring for\nthe residents and tenants. We work actively with our operators and tenants to encourage and support\nbest practices in sustainability, energy efficiency, health, wellness and safety. We believe that these\ninitiatives not only benefit our stakeholders but also contribute to long-term stockholder value creation.\nSustainability starts at the highest level of the organization and is spread throughout as we believe that\nachieving operational excellence goes hand-in-hand with a responsibly run business.\nAs part of overseeing our corporate strategy and our enterprise risk management program, our Board\nof Directors monitors our environmental and social practices as an entire Board. Additionally, specific\ncommittees oversee certain programs related to our sustainability efforts. We have a dedicated\nCorporate Responsibility and Governance Committee which oversees our sustainability program as a\nwhole, including our climate-related disclosures and practices. Our Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing human capital management matters, which include policies, programs and\ninitiatives focusing on the Company’s culture, talent development, employee retention, diversity, equity\nand inclusion and employee health, wellness and safety. We have a formalized management-level\nSustainability Steering Committee. This cross-functional working group of individuals in environmental,\nhealth and safety, facilities, investor relations, finance, legal, human resources and other functions,\nallows us to gather data and insights for focus areas that impact our environmental stewardship, social\ncommitments, and corporate governance. The Sustainability Steering Committee reports to the\nCorporate Responsibility and Governance Committee at least three times per year. Dedicated\nsubgroups within the Sustainability Steering Committee have specific areas of emphasis and each in\nturn contributes by overseeing key performance indicators surrounding the Company’s sustainability\npractices.\nIn 2023, we published our third annual sustainability report, and we are in the process of producing our\nfourth annual report. We utilize aspects of the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board, the Global Real\nEstate Sustainability Benchmark, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to report\non our practices. Our reports and other disclosures can be found on the Investors—Governance section\nof our website at www.sabrahealth.com.\nHuman Capital Management and Engagement\nWe recognize that attracting and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continuing success. We aim\nto attract professionals who will uphold our values. We ensure our teammates receive competitive\ncompensation and conduct pay analyses to review our pay equity. We also invest in our teammates\nthrough high-quality benefits and meaningful health and wellness initiatives. Employee development\nand growth is fundamental to our approach to human capital management. We actively work on our\nteammates’ career development efforts and focus on aligning our talent strategy with our business\nstrategy. When we create a workplace where our teammates are engaged, committed and empowered\nfor the long-term, we are better positioned to create value for the Company, as well as for our\nstockholders. We promote employee engagement through focused surveys and through team\ngatherings, including our employee events and annual retreat.\n32\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nWe believe that a diverse workforce is essential to our continued success, and we strive to maintain a\nfair, healthy and safe workplace, while creating a work environment that promotes diversity, equity and\ninclusion for our teammates. Our current diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is focused on our\nrecruitment and training. We are proactively seeking out partnerships to attract new candidates, and\nwe engaged third-party consultants to conduct inclusivity and bias training for our Board of Directors,\nmanagement and employees. As of December 31, 2023, women comprised 54% of our workforce and\n67% of our management level/leadership roles. As of December 31, 2023, 31% of our teammates self-\nidentified as members of one or more racial and ethnic minorities.\nAs underscored by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors and the Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee are committed to proactively consider a diverse collection\nof backgrounds and relevant experiences in our director candidates to best ensure the continued\nsuccess of our business and represent our stockholder interests. As a part of this commitment, they\nactively seek qualified women and individuals from underrepresented groups as director nominees.\nSince March 2019, we have appointed four new directors with a diverse range of skills, expertise and\nbackgrounds, all of whom are diverse by gender or race and/or ethnicity. The current board\ncomposition is 38% diverse by gender and 25% by race and/or ethnicity.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\nWe believe in implementing measures that support healthy, sustainable and energy efficient spaces.\nAs the substantial majority of Sabra’s properties are leased under long-term, triple-net operating\nleases, the implementation of environmental measures at these properties are managed by our\noperators. We actively engage with our operator teams and encourage them to practice responsible\nproperty management that emphasizes health, safety, energy and water conservation. In late 2022, we\nestablished our Green Links program to benefit and support our triple-net tenants including, where\nappropriate, financing environmentally beneficial improvements. In 2023, we approved the first Green\nLinks lighting retrofitting projects at three of our triple-net skilled nursing facilities. We continue to seek\npotential opportunities for our Green Links program as well as build out a robust assessment of our\nScope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe also monitor environmental risk factors in order to assess the climate resiliency of the properties in\nour portfolio, such as exposure to floods or other natural disasters. We assess these climate-related\nrisks as a part of our enterprise risk assessment, which is overseen by our Board of Directors.\nHealth and Safety\nThe safety and well-being of everyone within the Sabra community is one of our highest priorities. For\nour operators, we are a committed resource to support them in their health, wellness and safety\nmeasures. For instance, we have supported many of our operators as they have achieved certification\nfrom WELL Health-Safety Rating, an evidence-based, third-party-verified rating body that recognizes\ncommitments to promote safer and healthier environments for employees and residents. In addition,\nwe regularly work with operators to identify, pilot and support a number of Medtech (medical\ntechnology) initiatives and solutions to foster a safe and healthy environment for employees and\nresidents.\n33\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\n“Our ESG\nprinciples are\nintrinsically tied\nto our objective\nto drive\nshareholder\nvalue.

Any Non-Employee Director serving as the\nLead Independent Director and each Chairperson of a committee of the Board of Directors is entitled to\nreceive an additional annual retainer, payable in four equal quarterly installments, as follows: $30,000\nfor the Lead Independent Director, $25,000 for Audit Committee Chair, $15,000 for Compensation\nCommittee Chair, and $15,000 for Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee Chair. The\nannual retainer and any additional retainers are each pro-rated for partial years of service.\nThe Non-Employee Directors have the right to elect to receive their annual retainers and any additional\nannual retainers in the form of stock units in lieu of cash, which units would be issued as of the last day\nof the quarter in which the retainers relate and would be valued as of the award date. Under our\ncurrent Directors’ Compensation Policy, each of the Non-Employee Directors is entitled to receive an\nannual award of restricted stock units valued at $135,000 on the date of the award. Each\nNon-Employee Director’s annual award of restricted stock units vests monthly over a period of one\nyear (and will in all events become vested in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders\noccurring in the year following the date of grant), is not distributable as shares of our common stock\nuntil the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the grant date, a change in control or the Non-Employee\nDirector’s separation from service from the Board of Directors, and any unvested restricted stock units\nshall accelerate and vest in full on the occurrence of a change in control or the Non-Employee\nDirector’s death or disability. All stock units are entitled to receive dividend equivalent payments, which\nare either paid in cash on a current basis (if the underlying units have vested) or reinvested into\nadditional stock units. Each Non-Employee Director’s annual award of restricted stock units is\npro-rated for partial years of service.\nEach of our Non-Employee Directors is reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses for attendance at Board\nof Directors and committee meetings.\nStock Ownership Policy Applicable to Non-Employee Directors\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Stock Ownership Policy that requires each Non-Employee\nDirector to own shares of our common stock equal in value to five times the annual Board cash\nretainer. Shares of our common stock subject to stock unit awards that have vested but the payment of\nwhich has been deferred count toward satisfaction of the required ownership level, but shares subject\nto stock options or unvested stock unit awards are not considered owned by the Non-Employee\nDirector for purposes of this policy. The Non-Employee Directors are required to be in compliance with\nthe required ownership level within five years from the date such person is first appointed or elected as\na Non-Employee Director and are required to retain 50% of the net after-tax shares received in respect\nof equity awards until they are in compliance. Each of the Non-Employee Directors is currently in\ncompliance with the required ownership levels or is within the five-year transition period for new\ndirectors.\n36\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nIntroduction\nOur “Named Executive Officers” for 2023 are: Richard K. Matros, our Chief Executive Officer,\nPresident and Chair of the Board; Michael L. Costa, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and\nExecutive Vice President; and Talya Nevo-Hacohen, our Chief Investment Officer, Treasurer and\nExecutive Vice President.\nIn 2023, under the direction of our Board, our Named Executive Officers remained focused on the\nareas where we could create value for our stockholders, including identifying and prudently executing\nstrategies to further enhance the quality of our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet.\nKey highlights from 2023 include:\nŠ Throughout the pandemic, we have looked for opportunities to rebalance our portfolio so that\nwe will be in the most advantageous position as the industry normalizes. In 2023, we\ncompleted dispositions of 29 facilities, including 25 skilled nursing facilities (including one\nleased to a tenant under a sales-type lease), generating $289.3 million in gross proceeds. As a\nresult of these transactions and our investing and repurposing activity, our skilled nursing\nexposure at the end of 2023 was 54.1% of our Annualized Cash NOI—making our portfolio the\nmost diverse and balanced in the Company’s history. Annualized Cash NOI is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure. See Appendix A for an explanation and reconciliation to net income, the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nŠ We successfully transitioned 11 wholly-owned senior housing managed communities formerly\noperated by Enlivant to Inspirit Senior Living. We also successfully transitioned 24 skilled\nnursing facilities formerly operated by North American Health Care to the Ensign Group and\nAvamere Family of Companies. Performance from both of these transitions has exceeded\nexpectations.\nŠ Even with the challenges posed by the disruption in our industry, our team was able to\nstrengthen our balance sheet. In the beginning of 2023, we refinanced our credit facility. This\nrefinancing, combined with our timely execution of hedging arrangements, has resulted in our\nhaving no near-term debt maturities or floating rate debt, excluding borrowings on the revolving\ncredit facility. Our strong balance sheet provides an excellent foundation for growth when the\nright opportunities arise.\nŠ Our focus on internal growth, including enhancing our portfolio and strengthening our balance\nsheet, has resulted in Sabra entering 2024 stronger and more diverse than at any other time in\nthe Company’s history.\nŠ As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $946.9 million in liquidity, consisting of\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 million and available borrowings of\n$905.6 million under our revolving credit facility.\n37\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nSummary of 2023 Compensation Decisions\nThe Compensation Committee continues to believe that the executive compensation program objective\nis to reward our executives for successfully creating long-term stockholder value by executing on our\nstrategic plan, while at the same time holding executives accountable for performance and requiring\nforfeiture of compensation if they are not able to successfully execute our strategic plan and grow\nstockholder value.\nPrimary objective of 2023 compensation decisions\nMotivate Named Executive Officers to create long-term stockholder value\nThe Compensation Committee’s actions to incentivize the Named Executive Officers to create long-\nterm value included the following highlights:\nUtilize approximate 50th The Compensation Committee’s philosophy is to reference the\npercentile compensation 50th percentile of our peer group when setting our Named\nphilosophy for target total direct Executive Officers’ target total direct compensation (base salary\ncompensation + target bonus amount + target grant date value of long-term\nequity awards). This is a guideline and compensation is not\nformulaically set at the 50th percentile, and target total direct\ncompensation for our Named Executive Officers may be above\nor below the 50th percentile depending on performance and\nexperience.\n65% of grant date value of Approximately 65% of the grant date value of our 2023 annual\nannual equity awards is equity awards is subject to performance-vesting conditions.\nperformance-based, with TSR The weighting of the relative total stockholder return-based\nUnits making up approximately awards (“TSR Units”) is approximately 70% of the grant date\n70% of performance-based value of the performance-based annual equity awards, with the\nawards remaining approximately 30% in FFO-based awards (“FFO\nUnits”). The TSR Units are upweighted to align rewards with\nour stockholders and the TSR Units require above-median\nperformance in order for the target shares to be earned,\nsupporting alignment between management and long-term\nstockholders.\nLong-term equity awards are All long-term equity awards granted to the Named Executive\nsubject to a mandatory five-year Officers are subject to a mandatory deferral feature which\ndeferral and one-year post- requires vested awards be held and not become payable until\nvesting holding period the fifth calendar year following the grant date. This deferral\nfeature is in addition to a one-year post-vesting holding period.\nThe mandatory five-year deferral and one-year post-vesting\nholding period help ensure that the interests of the Named\nExecutive Officers remain aligned with our stockholders.\nRobust stock ownership Our Stock Ownership Policy requires our Chief Executive\nrequirements (10x for CEO and Officer to have direct ownership of shares of our common stock\n5x for other executives) having a value equal to at least 10 times his annual base\nsalary, and for the other Named Executive Officers to have\ndirect ownership of shares of our common stock having a value\nequal to at least 5 times his or her annual base salary.\n38\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nNo COVID-19 or other Both the 2020 FFO Unit and the TSR Unit payouts were made\nadjustments for 2020 FFO Units according to their original performance funding schedules,\nand TSR Units; 100% of 2020 without any discretion or adjustment by the Compensation\nFFO Units forfeited and an Committee for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nabove target payout for 2020 skilled nursing and senior housing community during the three-\nTSR Units year performance period ending on December 31, 2023. The\nFFO Units that were eligible to vest for performance through\nDecember 31, 2023 were forfeited by the Named Executive\nOfficers, while the TSR Units paid out at approximately 149%\nof target. The FFO Units originally granted in 2020 were eligible\nto vest based on our adjusted normalized FFO performance for\ncalendar 2023 (the last year of the three-year performance\nperiod), while the 2020 TSR Unit grants were eligible to vest\nbased on our relative shareholder return ranking over a three-\nyear performance period ending on December 31, 2023.\nLargely because of our efforts to enhance the quality of our\nportfolio and strengthen our balance sheet through calculated\ndispositions, our adjusted normalized FFO performance per\nshare for 2023 fell below the threshold performance level, and\nas a result, the Named Executive Officers forfeited 100% of\ntheir 2020 FFO Units without any payment. Our relative TSR\nperformance for the three-year performance period ending on\nDecember 31, 2023 was at approximately the 67th percentile\nrelative to our TSR peer group companies, resulting in a payout\nequal to approximately 149% of their target TSR Units. We\nbelieve the Named Executive Officers’ forfeiture of 100% of\ntheir FFO Units during a three-year performance period where\nour TSR performance exceeded more than two thirds of the\ncompanies comprising our TSR peer group demonstrates the\nrigor of the Compensation Committee’s goal setting process\nand philosophy not to make discretionary adjustments to\npreviously established targets, even though an adjustment to\nour business strategy during the pandemic resulted in lower\nFFO but above median TSR performance during the\nperformance period.\nThe remainder of this section describes our executive compensation program and the material\nelements of compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to the Named Executive Officers during\n2023.\nCompensation Program and Objectives\nOur compensation program for executives is intended to:\nŠ motivate our executive officers to create long-term stockholder value;\nŠ align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders;\n39\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nŠ attract and retain quality executive officers;\nŠ motivate and reward high performance levels; and\nŠ inspire teamwork and collaboration among the executives.\nWe believe that our executive compensation program is appropriately structured to accomplish these\nobjectives. Our executive compensation program consists of four material elements: base salaries,\nannual incentive compensation opportunities, long-term incentive awards and severance benefits.\nEach of these compensation elements is described in more detail below.\nRole of the Compensation Committee\nPursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has the authority to\ndetermine the amount of compensation provided to each of the Named Executive Officers. The\nCompensation Committee approves our executive compensation philosophy and procedures, and is\nresponsible for administering our equity compensation plans, including approving grants of awards\nunder the plans. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for approving employment\nagreements with the Named Executive Officers. In performing its duties, the Compensation Committee\nconsiders the recommendations of our Chair and Chief Executive Officer when determining the\ncompensation of the other Named Executive Officers.\nThe elements of our executive compensation program were each approved by the Compensation\nCommittee. None of the Named Executive Officers is a member of the Compensation Committee or,\nexcept for recommendations made by Mr. Matros with respect to the compensation of the other Named\nExecutive Officers, had any role in determining the compensation of the Named Executive Officers.\nRole of the Compensation Consultant\nSince our becoming a separate publicly traded company, the Compensation Committee has retained\nFW Cook as its independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee is directly\nresponsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of FW Cook’s work and does not believe\nFW Cook’s work has raised any conflict of interest. FW Cook reports only to the Compensation\nCommittee, and does not perform services for us, except for executive and director compensation-\nrelated services on behalf of, and as instructed by, the Compensation Committee.\nAt the end of 2022 and in preparation for making base salary and bonus award decisions for 2023, and\nagain at the end of 2023 in preparation for making 2023 equity award grants and base salary and\nbonus award decisions for 2024, the Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook to conduct an\nindependent review of our executive compensation program to provide a competitive reference on pay\nlevels, structure and performance alignment. As part of its review, FW Cook analyzed the salaries,\ntarget bonus opportunities, target cash compensation opportunities, equity award opportunities and\ntargeted total direct compensation paid by our peer group of companies described below.\nThe Compensation Committee reviewed the reports prepared by FW Cook at the end of both 2022 and\n2023 and used these reports, as applicable, when determining the amount and structure of each\nNamed Executive Officer’s 2023 cash base salary, bonus opportunity and equity award grants.\n40\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nFW Cook also advised on other aspects of executive compensation as requested by the Compensation\nCommittee during 2023. For example, FW Cook provided the Compensation Committee with advice\nwith respect to our peer group used for compensation comparison purposes described below and a\nproposal for an updated group of peer companies to use for TSR comparison purposes for the TSR\nUnits that were granted in December 2023. FW Cook also provided the Compensation Committee with\nadvice regarding the timing of our annual equity awards and advised that continuing to make annual\nequity awards during the fourth quarter of each calendar year better allows us to consider our\nperformance for the year when determining the level of equity awards to be granted for that year. This,\nin turn, allows us to most closely match the value of our executive compensation program with internal\nperformance and stockholder return during the year.\nPeer Companies\nWhen determining the amount of each Named Executive Officer’s 2023 cash base salary and target\nbonus opportunity at the end of 2022, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of FW Cook,\nconsidered the compensation paid by the following peer companies, which we refer to as the 2022\npeer group:\nAcadia Realty Trust National Health Investors, Inc.\nCareTrust REIT, Inc. National Retail Properties, Inc.\nCousins Properties Incorporated Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.\nEPR Properties Physicians Realty Trust\nGaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. Seritage Growth Properties\nHealthcare Realty Trust Incorporated Spirit Realty Capital, Inc.\nHealthpeak Properties, Inc. STAG Industrial, Inc.\niStar Inc. STORE Capital Corporation\nLTC Properties, Inc. Sun Communities Inc.\nLXP Industrial Trust VICI Properties Inc.\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc. W. P. Carey Inc.\nThe only changes to our 2022 peer group from the peer companies used at the end of 2021 were the\naddition of CareTrust REIT, Inc., which is a healthcare REIT with a net lease focus that is included in\nthe peer group of a significant number of Sabra’s existing peers and also has its headquarters in\nOrange County, California, and the removal of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc., MGM Growth\nProperties LLC, Retail Properties of America, Inc. and VEREIT, Inc., which were acquired in late 2021\nor 2022. Also, in December 2021, Lexington Realty Trust changed its name to LXP Industrial Trust.\nWhen determining the amount of each Named Executive Officer’s 2023 long-term equity award grants\nat the end of 2023, we used the same group of peer companies listed above, except for the addition of\nCommunity Healthcare REIT and the removal of iStar Inc., STORE Capital Corporation, Seritage\nGrowth Properties, VICI Properties Inc. and Sun Communities Inc. The companies we removed from\nour 2022 peer group were removed either because they had been acquired or no longer qualified as a\nREIT or because they no longer satisfied our size parameters described below, while Community\n41\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nHealthcare REIT was added as a relatively smaller peer company based on the financial screening\ncriteria below to further balance the 2023 peer group. Our 2023 peer group is listed in the table below:\nAcadia Realty Trust LXP Industrial Trust\nCareTrust REIT, Inc. Medical Properties Trust, Inc\nCommunity Healthcare REIT National Health Investors, Inc.\nCousins Properties Incorporated National Retail Properties, Inc.\nEPR Properties Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.\nGaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.

Carey Inc.\nThe objective peer group selection methodology remained consistent with prior years. We selected\npublicly traded, internally managed, U.S. based REITs with total revenues between 0.33x and 3.0x\nours and enterprise values between 0.33x and 4.0x ours, with a preference for including healthcare\nREITs where possible even if that required some adjustment to the normal size parameters. Year-over-\nyear continuity in the peer group companies was prioritized where reasonable.\nThe Compensation Committee considers the compensation paid by the peer group companies as one\ninput among a diverse set of factors for evaluating compensation decisions with respect to the Named\nExecutive Officers.\nIn 2023, the Compensation Committee referenced the peer group compensation data when making\npay decisions, alongside a number of other considerations including individual experience and\nperformance, each executive’s impact and criticality, internal pay equity considerations, as well as\nCompany performance.\nRole of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes\nSabra currently provides its stockholders with the opportunity to cast an annual non-binding, advisory\nvote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, which we refer to as a say-on-pay\nproposal. At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 94.9% of the votes cast supported our\nsay-on-pay proposal. The results at our 2023 Annual Meeting were consistent with the results in prior\nyears following our becoming a separate publicly traded REIT, where stockholders supported our\nsay-on-pay proposal by between 93.1% and 98.9% of the votes cast. The Compensation Committee\nbelieves this high degree of stockholder support for our 2023 say-on-pay proposal, combined with\nsimilarly high degrees of support for our say-on-pay proposals in prior years, affirms stockholders’\nsupport of our executive compensation program.\nThe Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of stockholders’ votes on our\nsay-on-pay proposals when making future compensation decisions for the Named Executive Officers.\n42\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nMaterial Elements of Compensation\nBase Salaries\nWe pay each Named Executive Officer a base salary to provide each executive with a minimum, fixed\nlevel of cash compensation.\nThe Compensation Committee reviewed each executive’s base salary at the end of 2022 to determine\nwhether any increases for 2023 were warranted. The Compensation Committee determined not to\nmake any increase to Mr. Matros’ base salary for 2023, but approved an increase of 6.6% for\nMs. Nevo-Hacohen and 13.3% for Mr. Costa for 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee also reviewed each executive’s base salary at the end of 2023. The\nCompensation Committee determined not to make any increase to Mr. Matros’ base salary for 2024,\nbut approved an increase of 3.8% for Ms. Nevo-Hacohen and 14.7% for Mr. Costa for 2024.\nMr. Costa’s base salary increases for 2023 and 2024 reflect market adjustments made to bring his\nbase salary and target total direct compensation closer to the 50th percentile of our peer group and to\nrecognize Mr. Costa’s growth since his appointment as our Chief Financial Officer in January 2022.\nThe base salary that was paid to each Named Executive Officer for the 2023 calendar year is reported\nin the “Summary Compensation Table—2021—2023” below.\n2023 Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunity\nEach Named Executive Officer was eligible to participate in our annual incentive bonus program for\n2023.\nIn 2023, the target bonus opportunity under the bonus program was set at 150% of base salary for\nMr. Matros and at 100% of base salary for each of Ms. Nevo-Hacohen and Mr. Costa, which was the\nsame target bonus opportunity in effect for each executive during 2022. No Named Executive Officer\nreceived a target bonus increase as a percentage of base salary for 2023.\nEach Named Executive Officer was eligible to earn a maximum bonus equal to 200% of the executive’s\ntarget bonus amount. The bonus payable for achieving the threshold performance level was set at 0%\nof the executive’s target bonus amount.\nThe following chart shows the amount of each Named Executive Officer’s target and maximum bonus\nopportunities.\n2023 Target Cash 2023 Maximum Cash\nName Bonus Amount Bonus Amount\n($) ($)\nRichard K. Matros 1,387,500 2,775,000\nTalya Nevo-Hacohen 650,000 1,300,000\nMichael L. Costa 510,000 1,020,000\n43\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nAwards under the 2023 bonus program were earned based on our adjusted normalized FFO\nperformance per share for 2023 relative to pre-established objective targets for 2023.\nThe target level of adjusted normalized FFO per share was set at $1.3290. The 2023 FFO per share\ntarget was lower than our 2022 achieved adjusted normalized FFO per share of $1.5363. This lower\ntarget was established by the Compensation Committee to take into account our current strategy to\nenhance the quality of our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet through calculated dispositions.\nAs noted above, while this strategy has resulted in lower FFO per share than in prior years, we were\nable to achieve TSR performance that exceeded more than two thirds of the companies comprising our\nTSR peer group over the past three years by executing on this strategy.\nAchievement of adjusted normalized FFO per share of $1.3689 or greater was required in order for\neach Named Executive Officer to earn his or her maximum bonus opportunity, while achievement of\nadjusted normalized FFO per share of greater than $0.9968 was required in order for each Named\nExecutive Officer to earn any bonus opportunity.\nThe Compensation Committee chose an FFO-based performance metric for two primary reasons.\nFirst, an FFO-based metric rewards executives for driving growth in annual FFO performance, which\nthe Compensation Committee believes benefits stockholders in the form of increased stockholder\nreturns. Second, the Compensation Committee believes that FFO is a common performance metric\nused by investors to evaluate the performance of REITs, and the Compensation Committee wanted the\nNamed Executive Officers to be focused on the same performance metric as our investors.\nWe believe measuring our FFO performance against per share targets will motivate our executives to\nachieve not just absolute FFO growth, but growth on an FFO per share basis as well that takes into\naccount the impact of capital raising transactions on our stockholders.\nFor purposes of our 2023 bonus program, we define adjusted normalized FFO per share to mean\n(A) our FFO for 2023, as prescribed by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts\n(“Nareit”) as in effect on the first day of the applicable period, adjusted to eliminate the impact of\n(1) non-recurring items, including without limitation the write-off of deferred financing fees, contingent\nconsideration adjustments, transitional expenses related to any completed merger involving Sabra,\nnon-senior housing managed facility operating expenses, loss or gain associated with foreign currency\ntransactions, and other similar items as determined by the Compensation Committee, (2) non-cash\ncompensation expense, (3) cash bonuses payable to our officers and employees, (4) transaction costs\nand normalizing adjustments in connection with investment activity and capital markets activity, (5) any\nchange in accounting policies or practices, (6) any gain or loss related to lease or rental income\nrestructurings and changes in lease classifications, including write offs of above/below market rent\n(ABMR) intangibles and straight-line rent receivables, to the extent included in FFO as defined by\nNareit, (7) loan, preferred equity, direct financing lease, sales-type lease, and unconsolidated joint\nventure investment impairments or loss reserves, and (8) deferred income tax expense, divided by\n(B) the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents\noutstanding, calculated on the same basis as used for reporting Adjusted Funds from Operations\nAttributable to Common Stockholders as publicly reported by us in our press release for the calendar\nyear immediately preceding the start of the performance period.\nSabra achieved adjusted normalized FFO per share of $1.3772 in 2023, which resulted in each Named\nExecutive Officer receiving a bonus payout equal to the maximum 200% of his or her target bonus\nopportunity.\n44\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nLong-Term Incentives\nStructure and Timing of 2023 Equity Awards.\nStructure of 2023 Equity Awards. A key feature of our executive compensation program is our long-\nterm equity award program. In 2023, 65% of the Named Executive Officers’ annual equity awards are\nsubject to performance-vesting conditions over a three-year performance period, and 35% are in stock\nunits that become vested based on continued employment over four years (“Time-Based Units”). All\nawards are payable in shares of our common stock that may increase or decrease in value during the\nvesting period.\nTSR Units comprise approximately 70% of the grant date value of the performance-based annual\nequity awards, with FFO Units making up the remaining approximately 30% of the performance-based\nannual equity awards. The Compensation Committee weights the TSR Units higher because it believes\nthat they are an effective vehicle to motivate our Named Executive Officers to create long-term\nstockholder value, requiring our executives to successfully execute our strategic vision and grow\nstockholder value at a greater rate than our TSR comparison peer companies listed below.\nThe table below summarizes the 2023 equity award grants (with FFO Units and TSR Units shown at\nthe target levels and the grant date value based on the amount approved by the Compensation\nCommittee):\nName Time-Based Units FFO Units TSR Units\n$1,575,410 $900,238 $2,043,851\nRichard K. Matros\n117,218 units 66,982 units 128,625 units\n$560,152 $320,087 $726,697\nTalya Nevo-Hacohen\n41,678 units 23,816 units 45,733 units\n$490,130 $280,076 $635,870\nMichael L. Costa\n36,468 units 20,839 units 40,017 units\nMandatory Deferral and Holding Period after Vesting. We have a deferral feature for the Named\nExecutive Officers’ Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units, which requires that vested awards be\nheld and will not become payable until the fifth calendar year following the grant date. We also have a\nholding period requirement for Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units granted to the Named\nExecutive Officers. For any Time-Based Units, FFO Units or TSR Units that vest, executives are\nrequired to wait a minimum of one year after the vesting date before receiving payment of the\nunderlying vested shares. The only exceptions to the one-year holding requirement are if the executive\ndies or suffers a disability, or if there is a change in control. Similarly, the only exceptions to the\ndeferral requirement are if the executive dies, suffers a disability or otherwise has a termination of\nemployment, or if there is a change in control after the awards vest. The Compensation Committee\nbelieves the one-year holding requirement coupled with the deferral requirement further reinforces the\nlong-term nature of the awards and serves to further align the executives’ interests with those of our\nlong-term stockholders. All long-term equity awards granted to the Named Executive Officers during\n2023 are subject to the same mandatory five-year deferral requirement and one-year post-vesting\nholding period.\n45\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nTiming of 2023 Equity Awards. The Compensation Committee determined the total grant date dollar\nvalue of each Named Executive Officer’s 2023 equity awards in December 2023, which is our normal\ngrant timing. We convert the total grant date dollar value of each executive’s equity award into a\nnumber of Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units using the same accounting value of each\naward that is used in our financial statements. We utilize this conversion approach so that the grant\ndate award value of each type of award reported in our proxy statement (such as in the “Grants of\nPlan-Based Awards—2023” table below) is approximately equal to the grant date dollar value of the\naward that is approved by the Compensation Committee.\nWe believe that making annual equity awards in the fourth quarter of each calendar year allows us to\nconsider our performance for the year when determining the level of equity awards to be granted for\nthat year, as well as any feedback from stockholders on the say-on-pay proposal for the year.\nTime-Based Units: Time-Based Units are included as part of each executive’s annual long-term equity\naward to provide an equity incentive linked to the value realized by our stockholders that becomes\nearned based on the executive’s continued employment with us. Time-Based Units made up\napproximately 35% of the total grant date value of each Named Executive Officer’s 2023 annual equity\naward. The Time-Based Units granted in 2023 vest in equal annual installments over four years, with\ninstallments vesting on December 31 in each of 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, with any vested units\nsubject to the one-year post-vesting holding period requirement and deferral feature described above.\nFFO Units: FFO Units are included as part of each executive’s long-term equity award to motivate\nthem to execute our multi-year operating plan and increase our long-term FFO performance, which we\nbelieve drives stockholder value creation. FFO Units made up approximately 30% of the performance-\nbased annual equity awards and approximately 20% of the total grant date value of each Named\nExecutive Officer’s 2023 annual equity award.\nFFO Units granted in 2023 are earned based on our adjusted normalized FFO performance per share\nfor the calendar year 2026 relative to a pre-established objective target for 2026 determined by the\nCompensation Committee. Adjusted normalized FFO per share is defined for these purposes as\n(A) our FFO for 2026, adjusted to eliminate the impact of (1) non-recurring items, including without\nlimitation the write-off of deferred financing fees, contingent consideration adjustments, transitional\nexpenses related to any completed merger, non-senior housing managed facility operating expenses,\nloss or gain associated with foreign currency transactions, and other similar items as determined by the\nCompensation Committee, (2) non-cash compensation expense, (3) cash bonuses payable to our\nofficers and employees, (4) transaction costs and normalizing adjustments in connection with\ninvestment activity and capital markets activity, (5) any change in accounting policies or practices,\n(6) any gain or loss on lease or rental income restructurings and changes in lease classifications\n(including write offs of above/below market rent intangibles and straight-line rent receivables) to the\nextent included in FFO, (7) loan, preferred equity, direct financing lease, sales-type lease and\nunconsolidated joint venture investment impairments or loss reserves, and (8) deferred income tax\nexpense, divided by (B) the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock\nequivalents outstanding.\nWe believe that the adjusted normalized FFO per share target for 2026 is reasonably attainable if we\nare able to execute our strategic objectives. The decision to use the third calendar year in the\nperformance period as the performance measurement year is intended to give the executives a period\nof time to execute on Sabra’s strategic objectives.\n46\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nAlthough our annual incentive awards also become earned based on an FFO-based performance\nmetric, the FFO Units granted in any year will have different adjusted normalized FFO goals than those\nestablished under the annual bonus program. They are different incentive goals and require different\nperformance to achieve them. The FFO Units become payable based on our performance for the third\ncalendar year following the grant date, while the annual incentive awards become payable based on\nour performance for the year in which the awards are granted. For example, the FFO Units granted in\n2023 become payable based on performance for 2026, and the annual incentive awards granted under\nthe bonus program for 2023 became payable based on performance for 2023. As a result, we believe\nthat the FFO Units incentivize long-term performance while annual incentive awards incentivize annual\nperformance, and executives are not rewarded twice for achieving the same FFO results because the\nFFO Units have a three-year FFO goal and the bonus program has a one-year FFO goal.\nBetween 0% and 200% of each executive’s target number of FFO Units are eligible to be earned\nbased on FFO per share performance in 2026. Threshold performance of 90.96% of the targeted\nperformance level is required for any FFO units to be earned and vest, while 200% of target FFO\nUnits will be earned and vest if we achieve 109.04% or more of the targeted performance level (the\nmaximum level). Performance up to the targeted performance level will result in between 0% and\n100% of each executive’s target number of FFO Units becoming vested, with linear interpolation\nbetween threshold and target. Performance between the targeted performance level and the maximum\nlevel will result in between 100% and 200% of the target number of FFO Units becoming vested, with\nlinear interpolation between target and maximum.\nThe vesting schedule for the FFO Units can be illustrated graphically as follows:\n2023 Vesting Schedule\n2026 FFO per Share (% Target) FFO Units Earned\n>109.04% 200% Percentage earned\nand vesting increasing\nMaximum 109.04% 200% 11% for each 1%\nincrease in the\n106.03% 167%\ntargeted performance\n103.01% 133% level achieved\nTarget 100.0% 100%\n96.99% 67% Percentage earned\nand vesting decreasing\n93.97% 33% 11% for each 1%\ndecrease in the\nThreshold 90.96% 0% targeted performance\n<90.96% 0% level achieved\nAny FFO Units that become eligible to vest based on our FFO performance are also subject to a\nvesting condition based on the executive’s continued employment through the last day of the\napplicable performance period, with any vested units subject to the one-year post-vesting holding\nperiod requirement and deferral feature described above.\nTSR Units: The Compensation Committee believes the TSR Units are an effective vehicle to motivate\nour Named Executive Officers to create long-term stockholder value, while requiring our executives to\nsuccessfully execute our strategic vision and grow stockholder value. TSR Units made up\napproximately 70% of the performance-based annual equity awards and approximately 45% of the\ntotal grant date dollar value of each Named Executive Officer’s 2023 annual equity award.\n47\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nThe TSR Units granted in 2023 become vested based on our relative total stockholder return over a\nthree-year performance period consisting of calendar years 2024-2026 measured against the following\npublicly traded REITs:\nAcadia Realty Trust Global Medical REIT Inc.

Orion Office REIT\nFranklin Street Properties Paramount Group, Inc.\nGaming and Leisure Properties, Inc.\nThis group of TSR comparison companies includes all publicly traded U.S. based industrial, office and\nhealthcare REITs with market capitalization values above $100,000,000 as of November 30, 2023, as well\nas certain of those companies included in our 2023 peer group used for compensation comparison\npurposes (55 companies in total). Although all of the compensation peers are included in the TSR\ncomparison peer group, the TSR comparison peer group is a different, broader set of companies. The\ncompanies in our 2023 compensation peer group (18 companies) were selected based on their similarity to\nSabra, taking into account their respective businesses, revenues, FFO, total assets, market capitalization,\nenterprise value and the talent pool for which they compete. The Compensation Committee believes that\nthe selection criteria for relative TSR performance comparison can be different than for compensation\ncomparison because REIT sectors are affected by similar economic forces (with REIT size playing a\nrelatively small role in stockholder return), while compensation amounts correlate with each of the REIT\nsector, Sabra’s size and the talent pool for which Sabra is competing.\nEach executive’s target number of TSR Units granted in 2023 are earned and vest for achieving a TSR\npercentile ranking at the 55th percentile relative to the applicable TSR peer companies. If our TSR\npercentile ranking relative to the applicable TSR peer companies is less than the 25th percentile (the\nthreshold level), the TSR Units are forfeited, while if we achieve a TSR ranking at or above the 80th\npercentile relative to the applicable TSR peer companies (the maximum level), 200% of each executive’s\ntarget number of TSR Units will become vested. Between 0% and 200% of the target number of TSR\nUnits can be earned based on the schedule below, with linear interpolation between points.\n48\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nThe vesting schedule for the TSR Units can be illustrated graphically as follows:\n2023 Vesting Schedule\nRelative TSR vs.TSR Peers Performance Level TSR Units Earned\n> 80P 200%\n80P Maximum 200%\n75P 180%\n70P 160%\n65P 140%\n60P 120%\n55P Target 100%\n50P 95%\n45P 85%\n40P 75%\n35P 65%\n30P 55%\n25P Threshold 45%\n< 25P 0%\nIf our TSR is negative over the performance period, the number of TSR Units eligible to become vested\nis capped at 100% of target to recognize that in such event, while our TSR may have exceeded that of\nour peers, our stockholders would not have realized a positive TSR on an absolute basis for this\nperiod.\nLike the FFO Units, any TSR Units becoming eligible to vest based on our relative TSR performance\nare also subject to a vesting condition based on the executive’s continued employment through the last\nday of the applicable performance period, with any vested units subject to the one-year post-vesting\nholding period requirement and deferral feature described above.\nDividend Equivalents: Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units granted under our long-term equity\naward program entitle the executive to receive an additional credit of stock units having a value equal\nto the amount of the ordinary cash dividends paid on the shares of common stock underlying the award\n(i.e., dividend equivalents are reinvested in additional units). Any additional stock units credited as a\ndividend equivalent payment will not be paid unless they vest and are subject to the same vesting\nrequirements as the stock unit awards to which they relate (including the applicable performance\nconditions).\nClawback: Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units granted under our long-term equity award\nprogram are each subject to the terms of our clawback policy described below.\nPayouts of Previously Granted Performance-Based Awards. The performance period applicable to\ncertain previously granted awards of TSR Units and FFO Units ended on December 31, 2023.\n49\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\n2021-2023 TSR Units. For the 2021-2023 TSR Unit performance period, we achieved a total\nstockholder return ranking equal to the 67.21st percentile, a performance that exceeded the target\nperformance level but that was less than the maximum performance level. As a result of our three-year\nrelative total stockholder return over this period, our Named Executive Officers earned a payout equal\nto 148.84% of the target number of TSR Units granted.\n2021-2023 FFO Units. For the 2021-2023 FFO Unit performance period, the target adjusted\nnormalized FFO per share amount was set at $1.8727 per share for the 2023 calendar year. Adjusted\nnormalized FFO per share is defined for these purposes substantially the same as described above in\nthe discussion of our 2023 FFO Units. We achieved adjusted normalized FFO per share of\napproximately $1.3772 per share. This was below the threshold amount for the 2021-2023 FFO Unit\nawards that were granted in 2020, and thus the FFO Units were forfeited in full.\nThe grant-date fair value of the Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units granted to the Named\nExecutive Officers in 2023 as determined under the accounting principles used in our financial\nreporting are reported in the “Summary Compensation Table—2021—2023” and the “Grants of Plan-\nBased Awards—2023” tables below.\nSeverance Benefits\nWe believe that severance protections, particularly in the context of the uncertainty surrounding any\npotential change in control transaction, play a valuable role in attracting and retaining quality executive\nofficers. We provide severance protections to each of the Named Executive Officers under their\nemployment agreements.\nAs described in more detail below under the heading “Potential Payments Upon Termination or\nChange in Control,” each of the Named Executive Officers would be entitled to severance benefits in\nthe event of a termination of employment by us without “good cause” or by the executive for “good\nreason” (as those terms are defined in each executive’s employment agreement). The severance\nbenefits for Mr. Matros are based on a 2.25x multiple, while the severance benefits for Mr. Costa and\nMs. Nevo-Hacohen are based on a 1.5x multiple. We do not believe that the Named Executive Officers\nshould be entitled to receive their cash severance benefits merely because a change in control\ntransaction occurs, and a change in control does not, in and of itself, entitle any Named Executive\nOfficer to receive severance benefits (i.e., these severance benefits are “double-trigger” benefits). The\namount of severance benefits for Mr. Costa and Ms. Nevo-Hacohen will increase and be based on a 2x\nmultiple in connection with a qualifying termination in connection with or following a change in control.\nThe severance benefit multiple for Mr. Matros will not increase for a qualifying termination in\nconnection with or following a change in control.\nNo Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive a “gross-up” or similar payment for any excise taxes\nthat may become payable in connection with a change in control pursuant to Sections 280G and 4999\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and, depending on what results in the\nbest after-tax benefit for the executive, benefits may be “cut back” instead in such circumstances.\nThe terms of Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units each provide for accelerated vesting in\nconnection with certain terminations of the Named Executive Officers’ employment with us, including a\ntermination due to death, disability or a termination by us without good cause or by the executive for\ngood reason but in general only if such termination occurs in connection with or following a change in\ncontrol. Please see the “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” section below for\na discussion of the termination of employment-based vesting provisions of these equity awards.\n50\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nStock Ownership Policy Applicable to Executive Officers\nWe believe that in order to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders,\nexecutive officers should have direct ownership of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, our Board\nof Directors has adopted a Stock Ownership Policy. Our Stock Ownership Policy requires our Chief\nExecutive Officer to own shares of our common stock having a value equal to at least ten times his\nannual base salary and each of our other executive officers to own shares of our common stock having\na value equal to at least five times the executive’s annual base salary. Shares subject to stock options\nand unvested stock unit awards are not considered owned by the executive for purposes of the policy.\nThe executive officers are required to be in compliance with the required ownership level within four\nyears from the date such person is first appointed as an executive officer and are required to retain\n50% of the net after-tax shares received in respect of equity awards until they are in compliance. Each\nof the Named Executive Officers is currently in compliance with the required ownership levels, except\nfor Mr. Costa, who has until January 1, 2027 and January 1, 2028 to comply with enhanced minimum\nstock ownership levels as a result of his salary increases for 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nClawback Policy\nOur Board of Directors has adopted an amended compensation recoupment policy in 2023. Our\ncompensation recoupment policy applies to incentive compensation paid to our executive officers,\nincluding our Named Executive Officers. The policy provides that if we are required to prepare an\naccounting restatement due to our material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement,\nour Compensation Committee shall require the Named Executive Officers to forfeit all or part of any\napplicable incentive compensation received by the Named Executive Officers during the covered\nperiod. For purposes of this policy, incentive compensation means any compensation that is earned,\ngranted, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. Our\nnew compensation recoupment policy complies with the requirements of the new SEC and Nasdaq\nclawback rules.\nPolicy with Respect to Section 162(m)\nSection 162(m) of the Code generally prohibits a publicly-held company from deducting compensation\npaid to a current or former Named Executive Officer that exceeds $1.0 million during the tax year.\nCertain awards granted before November 2, 2017 that were based upon attaining pre-established\nperformance measures that were set by the Compensation Committee under a plan approved by our\nstockholders, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract\nthat was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1.0 million deductibility\nlimit.\nAs one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee notes\nthis deductibility limitation. However, the Compensation Committee has the flexibility to take any\ncompensation-related actions that it determines are in the best interests of Sabra and our stockholders,\nincluding awarding compensation that may not be deductible for tax purposes. Because we are taxed\nas a REIT, Section 162(m) considerations are not as significant for us as for other publicly-traded\ncompanies that are not taxed as REITs. There can be no assurance that any compensation will in fact\nbe deductible as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m).\n51\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc., a Maryland\ncorporation (“Sabra”), has reviewed and discussed with management the disclosures contained in the\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement.

The amounts reported for 2023 include the aggregate grant date fair value of the Time-Based\nUnits, the FFO Units and the TSR Units granted to the Named Executive Officers during 2023.\nThe aggregate grant date fair value of these awards was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, and\nexcludes the effects of estimated forfeitures. The reported award values have been determined using the assumptions\ndescribed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Sabra’s 2023 Annual Report. The FFO Units\nare valued based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions as determined on the grant date,\nwhich results in a grant date fair value for the FFO Units as follows: Mr. Matros ($900,238); Ms. Nevo-Hacohen\n($320,087); and Mr. Costa ($280,076). If we achieve the highest level of performance under the FFO Units, the grant date\nfair value for the FFO Units would increase to the following amounts: Mr. Matros ($1,800,476); Ms. Nevo-Hacohen\n($640,174); and Mr. Costa ($560,152).\nPlease see “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Material Elements of Compensation” above for a discussion of the\ncomponents of our 2023 equity awards and how these awards were determined.\n(2) Amount reported for 2023 represents 401(k) plan matching contributions.\nDescription of Employment Agreements—Salary and Incentive\nBonus Payments\nAt the end of 2019, we entered into new employment agreements with each of Mr. Matros and\nMs. Nevo-Hacohen, and in January 2022 we entered into a new employment agreement with\nMr. Costa. Each executive’s agreement has an initial three-year term. The initial term is extended for a\nnew three-year term on each anniversary of the effective date, unless either party provides 60 days’\nnotice prior to the applicable anniversary of the effective date, in which case the agreement will\n53\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nterminate on the anniversary of the effective date occurring in the second year following the year in\nwhich such notice was provided. Each agreement is also subject to earlier termination in connection\nwith an executive’s termination of employment.\nEach executive’s employment agreement provides for an initial annual base salary to the executive\nthat is subject to annual merit increases. Each executive’s agreement entitles the executive to an\nannual incentive bonus pursuant to the terms of our executive bonus plan, which for 2023 was our\n2023 bonus program described above in “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Material\nElements of Compensation—2023 Annual Incentive Compensation.” Each executive’s agreement also\nprovides that the executive is entitled to participate in our usual benefit programs for our senior\nexecutives, to accrue paid time off in accordance with our policy for senior executives and to be\nreimbursed for the executive’s business expenses.\n54\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards—2023\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning the cash bonus opportunities, Time-Based\nUnits, FFO Units and TSR Units that were granted to the Named Executive Officers during 2023.

The amounts reported for these awards do not reflect whether the Named Executive\nOfficer has actually realized or will realize a financial benefit from the awards (such as by vesting in an award).\nDescription of Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunity\nDuring 2023, we granted each Named Executive Officer an annual incentive bonus opportunity. Our\nannual incentive bonus plan is described in more detail above in “—Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis—Material Elements of Compensation—2023 Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunity.”\n55\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nDescription of Equity Awards\nDuring 2023, we granted each Named Executive Officer annual equity awards in the form of Time-\nBased Units, FFO Units and TSR Units. Time-Based Units, FFO Units and TSR Units represents the\ncontractual right to receive one share of common stock. All of these awards were granted under, and\nare subject to the terms of, our 2009 Performance Incentive Plan. Certain of the terms of these awards\nare briefly described above in “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Material Elements of\nCompensation—Long-Term Incentives” and “—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Material\nElements of Compensation—2023 Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunity.”\nOutstanding Equity Awards at End of 2023\nThe following table presents information regarding the outstanding equity awards held by each of our\nNamed Executive Officers as of December 31, 2023, including the vesting dates for the portions of\nthese awards that had not vested as of that date. As described under “—Compensation Discussion\nand Analysis” above, these awards are also generally subject to a mandatory five-year deferral and\none-year post-vesting holding period. For outstanding stock units that are entitled to receive dividend\nequivalents that are reinvested in an additional number of units that are subject to the same vesting\nrequirements (including the applicable performance conditions) as the underlying units, the amounts\nreported include the additional units credited in respect of dividend equivalents as of December 31,\n2023.\n56\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nEquity Incentive Plan Equity Incentive Plan Awards:\nNumber of Shares or Market Value of Shares Awards: Number of Market or Payout Value of\nName Units of Stock That or Units of Stock That Unearned Shares, Units Unearned Shares, Units or\nHave Not Vested Have Not Vested or Other Rights That Other Rights That Have Not\n(#) ($)(1) Have Not Vested Vested\n(#) ($)(1)\n26,954 (2) 384,634 24,955 (6) 356,108\n66,177 (3) 944,346 264,516 (7) 3,774,643\n106,928 (4) 1,525,863 26,883 (8) 383,620\nRichard K.

For each\nNamed Executive Officer, payment of the severance benefits provided for under his or her employment\nagreement is conditioned upon the executive’s execution and delivery of (and not revoking) a general\nrelease in favor of us. All benefits described below would be provided by us. Please see\n“—Compensation Discussion and Analysis” above for a discussion of how the level of these benefits\nwas determined.\nSeverance Benefits—Employment Agreements. In the event that a Named Executive Officer’s\nemployment is terminated by us without “good cause” or by the executive for “good reason” (as those\nterms are defined in each executive’s employment agreement), each executive will be entitled to\nreceive the following benefits under his or her employment agreement:\n(cid:129) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to his or her annual base salary then in effect plus\nhis or her average bonus actually earned (which includes the value of the bonus elected to be\nreceived as an equity award under our annual incentive bonus program (“Bonus Units”) on the\nvesting date) for the prior three calendar years multiplied by a severance multiplier (equal to\n2.25 for Mr. Matros and 1.5 for each of Ms. Nevo-Hacohen and Mr. Costa);\n(cid:129) any accrued and unpaid bonus for any prior fiscal year;\n(cid:129) a prorated bonus payment for the year in which the termination occurs based on actual\nperformance, with any bonus earned becoming payable within seventy-four days after the\ncompletion of the year in which the executive’s termination occurs; and\n(cid:129) continued coverage for the executive and his or her family members under our health plans or,\nat the executive’s option, a monthly cash payment equal to the applicable COBRA premium for\nsuch continued coverage, for up to 24 months for Mr. Matros and up to 18 months for each of\nMs. Nevo-Hacohen and Mr. Costa.\nUnder the employment agreements, if a Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated by us\nwithout good cause or by the executive for good reason on or within two years following a change in\ncontrol of Sabra (including a termination by us without good cause that occurs up to six months prior to\n59\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\na change in control at the request of the party seeking to effect the change in control), each executive\nwill be entitled to receive the following benefits under his or her employment agreement in lieu of the\nbenefits described above:\n(cid:129) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to his or her annual base salary plus his or her\naverage bonus actually earned (which includes the value of Bonus Units on the vesting date)\nfor the prior three calendar years multiplied by a severance multiplier (equal to 2.25 for\nMr. Matros and two for each of Ms. Nevo-Hacohen and Mr. Costa);\n(cid:129) any accrued and unpaid bonus for any prior fiscal year;\n(cid:129) a prorated target bonus payment for the year in which the termination occurs calculated\nassuming we achieve 100% of the applicable financial performance target(s), with any bonus\nearned becoming payable within seventy-four days after the completion of the year in which\nthe executive’s termination occurs; and\n(cid:129) continued coverage for the executive and his or her family members under our health plans or,\nat the executive’s option, a monthly cash payment equal to the applicable COBRA premium for\nsuch continued coverage, for up to 24 months.\nHowever, the benefits described above may be limited—if any payments under an executive’s\nemployment agreement or otherwise trigger the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code,\npayments to the executive will be reduced as provided in the agreement to a level that does not trigger\nthe excise tax if the total after tax-benefit of such reduction exceeds the total after tax-benefit if such\nreduction is not made.\nIf a Named Executive Officer’s employment terminates due to his or her death or disability, the\nexecutive will be paid any accrued and unpaid bonus for any prior fiscal year, and a prorated bonus\npayment for the year in which the termination occurs.\nRestrictive Covenants. The employment agreements with the Named Executive Officers include each\nexecutive’s agreement that he or she will not disclose any of our confidential information at any time\nduring or after employment. In addition, each executive has agreed that, for a period of 18 months\nfollowing a termination of employment for Mr. Matros and for a period of one year following a\ntermination of employment for each of Ms. Nevo-Hacohen and Mr. Costa, he or she will not solicit our\nemployees or customers or materially interfere with any of our business relationships. Each agreement\nalso includes mutual non-disparagement covenants by the Named Executive Officer and us. If a\nNamed Executive Officer breaches any of these restrictive covenants, we may generally cease further\npayment of the executive’s severance benefits and recover any severance benefits that were paid to\nthe executive before the breach.\nAccelerated Vesting – Equity Awards. Outstanding equity awards granted to the Named Executive\nOfficers under our 2009 Performance Incentive Plan will be subject to accelerated vesting in\nconnection with certain types of terminations of employment, as described below:\n(cid:129) Time-Based Units. If an executive’s employment terminates due to death or disability, or as a\nresult of a termination by us without good cause or by the executive for good reason within 30\ndays prior to or 18 months after a change in control of Sabra, any unvested Time-Based Units\nand other stock-units granted by Sabra that vest based on continued employment will become\nfully vested.\n60\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\n(cid:129) FFO Units. If an executive’s employment terminates due to death or disability, or as a result of\na termination by us without good cause or by the executive for good reason within 30 days\nprior to or 18 months after a change in control of Sabra, the executive’s target number of FFO\nUnits will become fully vested.\n(cid:129) TSR Units. If an executive’s employment terminates due to death or disability, the executive’s\ntarget number of TSR Units will become fully vested. If an executive’s employment terminates\nas a result of a termination by us without good cause or by the executive for good reason\nwithin 30 days prior to or 18 months after a change in control of Sabra, then any TSR Units\nearned based on actual performance will become fully vested.\nThe following table provides information concerning the potential termination or change in control\npayments that would be made to each Named Executive Officer under the circumstances described\nabove. As prescribed by the SEC’s disclosure rules, in calculating the amount of any potential\npayments to the Named Executive Officers, we have assumed that the applicable triggering event (i.e.,\ntermination of employment and/or change in control) occurred on December 31, 2023. In the following\ntable, we use the term “involuntary termination” to refer to a termination by us without good cause or by\nthe executive for good reason.\nEquity\nCash Health\nAcceleration Total\nSeverance Benefits\nValue ($)(4)\n($)(1) ($)\n($)(2)(3)\nRichard K.

The actual severance benefits payable to the Named Executive Officers may be less than the amounts\nreported above as a result of the application of this “cut-back.”\nPay Ratio Disclosure\nPursuant to the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in this Proxy Statement the ratio of the\nannual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total\ncompensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer). Based on SEC rules for\nthis disclosure and applying the methodology described below, we have determined that our Chief\nExecutive Officer’s total compensation for 2023 was $8,219,499, and the median of the total 2023\ncompensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) was $300,359.\nAccordingly, we estimate the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer’s total compensation for 2023 to the\nmedian of the total 2023 compensation of all of our employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer)\nto be 27.4 to 1.\nWe identified the median employee by taking into account the total gross wages as reported on Form\nW-2 paid in 2023 to all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us on\nDecember 31, 2023. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or\nseasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to their total\ngross wages for 2023, although we did annualize the compensation for any permanent employees who\nwere not employed by us for all of 2023. We believe total gross wages for all employees is an\nappropriate measure.\nOnce the median employee was identified as described above, that employee’s annual total\ncompensation for 2023 was determined using the same rules that apply to reporting the compensation\nof our Named Executive Officers (including our Chief Executive Officer) in the “Total” column of the\n“Summary Compensation Table—2021—2023” above. The total compensation amounts included in\nthe first paragraph of this pay ratio disclosure were determined based on that methodology.\nWe believe that the pay ratio disclosure presented above is a reasonable estimate. Because the SEC\nrules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different\nmethodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, the pay ratio disclosure may not be\ncomparable to the pay ratio reported by other REITs or other public companies.\n62\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nPay Versus Performance\nValue of Initial Fixed $100\nInvestment Based on:\nAverage Average\nYear S C T Pau Eo bm m Olem p ( e $Ta n )or (y s 1ta a )l t i fo on r C A Pc Eo tm Ouap (le $lyn ) (s P 2a a ) t ii do n to S C T N Eau xo ob em m nl c-em p P u e tT Ea in vor Oy s eta a N Olt i afo fo fmn ir c e ed rs C A N N Ec xo o at em n mu c-ap eP ule dl tEy in v Os ePa at ii do n to T S Ro h et a ta url e r nh o ($ld )(e 4r ) N H T S Ro hA e et aa tR a url ltE e r h nhI T C o ($ la d )r (ee 5r ) N ($e )(t 6 I )n come A N F S ($Fd ho )O (j aru (m r 7 s ePa )t (e el 8id z r ) e d\n($)(3) Officers ($)(2)\n2023 8,219,499 12,212,423 3,259,707 4,361,230 73.54 94.40 13.8 1.3772\n2022 6,652,517 7,288,778 2,414,421 2,550,429 58.25 81.59 -77.6 1.5363\n2021 6,091,584 1,132,584 1,741,895 447,643 63.45 104.85 -113.3 1.6167\n2020 5,455,333 3,045,161 2,119,717 1,172,025 81.40 90.14 138.4 1.820\n(1) Reflects compensation amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table for our Chair and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Richard K.

The purpose of this\npolicy is to describe the procedures used to identify, review, approve and disclose, if necessary, any\ntransaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or\nrelationships) in which (x) Sabra was, is or will be a participant, (y) the aggregate amount involved\nexceeds $120,000 and (z) a related person has or will have a direct or indirect interest. For purposes of\nthis policy, a related person is (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of Sabra’s last\nfiscal year was, an executive officer, director or director nominee of Sabra, (ii) any person who is\nknown to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of Sabra’s common stock, (iii) any immediate family\nmember of any of the foregoing persons, or (iv) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the\nforegoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position, or in which all\nthe related persons, in the aggregate, have a 10% or greater beneficial interest.\nUnder this policy, Sabra’s Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving or ratifying each\nrelated person transaction or proposed transaction; provided, however, that if the transaction falls\nwithin one of certain specified pre-approved categories, it shall not require review by the Audit\nCommittee and shall be deemed to have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. In determining\nwhether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit Committee is required to consider\nall relevant facts and circumstances of the related person transaction available to the Audit Committee\nand to approve only those related person transactions that are in, or not inconsistent with, the best\ninterests of Sabra and its stockholders, as the Audit Committee determines in good faith. No member\nof the Audit Committee is permitted to participate in any consideration of a related person transaction\nwith respect to which that member or any of his or her immediate family is a related person.\nWe have not participated in any transaction with a related person since the beginning of fiscal 2023.\n70\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\nThe Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Sabra Health Care REIT Inc.,\na Maryland corporation (“Sabra”), is composed of Messrs. Barbarosh, Foster and Malehorn and\nMs. Kono. All members of the Audit Committee are independent directors who satisfy the requirements\nof Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(i) thereunder and the Nasdaq rules.\nThe Audit Committee held four meetings during 2023. The Audit Committee assists the Board in\nperforming its oversight responsibilities for our financial reporting process, audit process and internal\ncontrols as more fully described in the written charter of the Audit Committee, a copy of which is\navailable in the Investors—Governance section of our website at www.sabrahealth.com. Management\nhas the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the\nsystem of internal controls. PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for\nperforming an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over\nfinancial reporting in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (United States) and to issue a report thereon.\nIn the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 with management and with\nPwC. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the\napplicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”), which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct\nof the audit of our financial statements. The Audit Committee has also received and reviewed the\nwritten disclosures and the letter from PwC required by the applicable requirements of the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the Audit Committee\nconcerning independence and has discussed with PwC that firm’s independence and considered\nwhether the non-audit services provided by PwC are compatible with maintaining its independence.\nBased on the review and discussions with management and PwC described above, the Audit\nCommittee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements\nbe included in our 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC.\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors\nCraig A. Barbarosh (Chair)\nMichael J. Foster\nAnn Kono\nJeffrey A.

PwC has served as Sabra’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm since December 16, 2010.\nDescription of Professional Service 2023 2022\nAudit Fees – professional services rendered for the audit of Sabra’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and review of the interim condensed consolidated financial\n$ 1,316,813 $ 1,386,250\nstatements included in quarterly filings and services that are normally provided\nby PwC in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements\nAudit-Related Fees – assurance and related services that are reasonably related to\nthe performance of the audit or review of Sabra’s consolidated financial — —\nstatements\nTax Fees – professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax\n— 20,263\nplanning (1)\nAll Other Fees – products and services other than those reported as “Audit Fees,”\n— —\n“Audited-Related Fees” or “Tax Fees”\nTotal $ 1,316,813 $ 1,406,513\n(1) Tax fees in 2022 consisted of acquisition related tax due diligence and structuring, general tax planning and restructuring,\nconsulting regarding REIT status and qualification, state and local planning and consultations, and other tax consultations.\nAudit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nUnder its charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services to\nbe performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. Such pre-approval can be given as\npart of the Audit Committee’s approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent registered\npublic accounting firm or on an individual basis. The Audit Committee is authorized to delegate the\npre-approval of permitted non-audit services to one or more of its members and, pursuant to this\nauthority, the Audit Committee has authorized the Chair of the Audit Committee, Mr. Barbarosh, to\npre-approve interim requests for non-audit services, provided that any decisions to pre-approve any\nnon-audit services must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The\nAudit Committee pre-approved all of the non-audit services provided by PwC in 2023 and 2022.\n72\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\n(Proposal No. 1)\nNominees for Election\nThe Board of Directors currently consists of eight members. Upon the recommendation of the\nCorporate Responsibility and Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Craig A. Barbarosh,\nKatie Cusack, Michael J. Foster, Lynne S. Katzmann, Ann Kono, Jeffrey A. Malehorn, Richard K.\nMatros and Clifton J. Porter II for election to the Board. All of our director nominees are currently\ndirectors of Sabra. Information about each of our director nominees, including biographical summaries\nof their experience and qualifications, can be found in this Proxy Statement under the caption “Board of\nDirectors and Executive Officers—Directors of the Company.”\nIn recommending director nominees for selection by the Board, the Corporate Responsibility and\nGovernance Committee considers a number of factors, which are described in more detail above under\n“Corporate Governance—Director Nomination Process.” In considering these factors, the Corporate\nResponsibility and Governance Committee and the Board consider the fit of each individual’s skills with\nthose of other directors to build a board of directors that is effective, collegial and responsive to the\nneeds of the Company.\nEach of the nominees for election has consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve as\na director if elected. If any nominee becomes unable or unwilling for good cause to serve as a director\nfor any reason (which is not anticipated), your proxy may be voted for such other person or persons as\nmay be determined by the holders of such proxies or for the balance of the nominees, leaving a\nvacancy, unless our Board of Directors chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the\nBoard of Directors. Each of the directors who are elected will serve until the next annual meeting of\nstockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.\nMajority Voting Standard\nOur Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors. Under this majority\nvoting standard, once a quorum has been established, each director nominee receiving a majority of\nthe votes cast with respect to his or her election (that is, the number of votes cast FOR the nominee\nexceeds the number of votes cast AGAINST the nominee) will be elected as a director. The majority\nvoting standard does not apply, however, in a contested election where the number of director\nnominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. In such circumstances, directors will instead\nbe elected by a plurality of the votes cast, meaning that the persons receiving the highest number of\nFOR votes, up to the total number of directors to be elected at the meeting, will be elected.\nIn the case of an uncontested election where the number of director nominees does not exceed the\nnumber of directors to be elected, if a nominee who is then serving as a director is not elected at the\nmeeting by the requisite majority of the votes cast, under Maryland law, the director would continue to\nserve on the Board of Directors as a “holdover director.” To address this holdover issue, as required by\nour Bylaws, each director has submitted an irrevocable letter of resignation that becomes effective if\nthe director is not elected by stockholders and the Board of Directors accepts the resignation. If a\ndirector is not elected, the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee will consider the facts\n73\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nand circumstances relating to the election and the resignation and recommend to the Board of\nDirectors, within 60 days following certification of the election results, whether the resignation should\nbe accepted or rejected or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors must decide\nwhether to accept or reject the resignation within 90 days following certification of the election results,\ntaking into account the recommendation of the Corporate Responsibility and Governance Committee,\nand shall publicly disclose its decision. A nominee who was not already serving as a director and is not\nelected at the meeting by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director’s election will not be\nelected to our Board of Directors.\nThe election of directors at the Annual Meeting is not contested. Therefore, in accordance with the\nmajority voting standard, director nominees will be elected at the Annual Meeting by a majority of the\nvotes cast. Stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their shares for the purpose of electing\ndirectors.\nRecommendation of the Board\nOur Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the eight nominees for director.\n74\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nRATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT\nREGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n(Proposal No. 2)\nThe Audit Committee has appointed PwC to serve as our independent registered public accounting\nfirm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. We are not required by our Bylaws or applicable law\nto submit the appointment of PwC for stockholder approval. However, as a matter of good corporate\ngovernance, the Board of Directors has chosen to submit the Audit Committee’s appointment of PwC\nas our independent registered public accounting firm to stockholders for ratification. If stockholders do\nnot ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of another\nindependent registered public accounting firm. In addition, even if stockholders ratify the Audit\nCommittee’s selection, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still appoint a different independent\nregistered public accounting firm if it believes that such a change would be in the best interests of\nSabra.\nAdditional information about PwC, including the fees we paid to PwC in 2023 and 2022, can be found\nin this Proxy Statement under the caption “Audit Information.” The report of the Audit Committee\nincluded in this Proxy Statement under the caption “Audit Committee Report” also contains information\nabout the role of PwC with respect to the audit of our annual financial statements.\nA representative of PwC is expected to attend the Annual Meeting. The representative will have the\nopportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so, and is expected to be available to\nanswer appropriate questions.\nRecommendation of the Board\nOur Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR ratification of the appointment of PwC\nas Sabra’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024.\n75\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nADVISORY APPROVAL OF NAMED\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION\n(Proposal No. 3)\nSabra is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on the\ncompensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s executive\ncompensation disclosure rules and set forth in this Proxy Statement (including in the compensation tables\nand narratives accompanying those tables as well as in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis).\nAs described above in this Proxy Statement, in 2023, Sabra focused on the areas where we could\ncreate value for our stockholders, including identifying and prudently executing strategies to further\nenhance the quality of our portfolio and strengthen our balance sheet.\nThe Compensation Committee continues to believe that the executive compensation program objective is\nto reward our executives for successfully creating long-term stockholder value by executing on our\nstrategic plan, while at the same time penalizing our executives and requiring forfeiture of compensation\nif they are not able to successfully execute our strategic plan and grow stockholder value.\nAs described in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committee took\nseveral actions in 2023 to incentivize the Named Executive Officers to create long-term stockholder\nvalue. We urge stockholders to consider the Summary of 2023 Compensation Decisions contained in\nthe beginning of our Compensation Discussion and Analysis before voting on this proposal.\nIn accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC,\nour Board of Directors will request your advisory vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy\nStatement pursuant to the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes\nthe Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion that\naccompanies the compensation tables), is hereby approved.\nThis proposal on the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers is advisory only and will not\nbe binding on Sabra, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, and will not be construed\nas overruling a decision by, or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty for, Sabra, the Board of\nDirectors or the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee, which is\nresponsible for designing and administering Sabra’s executive compensation program, values the\nopinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the\nvote when making future compensation decisions for Named Executive Officers.\nSabra’s current policy is to provide stockholders with an opportunity to vote on the compensation of\nthe Named Executive Officers each year at the annual meeting of stockholders. It is expected that the\nnext such advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers will occur at the 2025\nannual meeting of stockholders.\nRecommendation of the Board\nOur Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation of\nour Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC’s\nexecutive compensation disclosure rules.\n76\nSabra 2024 Proxy Statement\nOTHER MATTERS\nThe Board of Directors knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual\nMeeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement. If any other matter properly comes before the\nAnnual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof and is voted upon, the proxyholders\nnamed in the proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will have the authority to vote all proxies\nreceived with respect to such matters in their discretion, and it is their intention to vote such proxies in\naccordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors.\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR\nNOMINATIONS FOR 2025 ANNUAL MEETING OF\nSTOCKHOLDERS\nRequirements for Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in Proxy Materials.
