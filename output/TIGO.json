These measures are referred to as “non-IFRS” measures and include: non-IFRS service revenue, non-IFRS EBITDA, and non-IFRS Capex, among others defined\nbelow. Annual growth rates for these non-IFRS measures are often expressed in organic constant currency terms to exclude the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, the adoption of new accounting standards, and are proforma for material\nchanges in perimeter due to acquisitions and divestitures. The non-IFRS financial measures are presented in this presentation as Millicom’s management believes they provide investors with an additional information for the analysis of Millicom’s\nresults of operations, particularly in evaluating performance from one period to another. Millicom’s management uses non-IFRS financial measures to make operating decisions, as they facilitate additional internal comparisons of Millicom’s\nperformance to historical results and to competitors' results, and provides them to investors as a supplement to Millicom’s reported results to provide additional insight into Millicom’s operating performance. Millicom’s Remuneration Committee\nusescertainnon-IFRS measures whenassessingtheperformance and compensation ofemployees, includingMillicom’sexecutivedirectors.\nThe non-IFRS financial measures used by Millicom may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies - refer to the section “Non-IFRS Financial Measure Descriptions” for\nadditional information. In addition, these non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS, and Millicom’s financial results calculated in accordance\nwithIFRS andreconciliationstothosefinancialstatementsshouldbe carefullyevaluated.\nFollowing the changes in perimeter following the Guatemala acquisition and the Africa disposal, Millicom's management modified the company's external reporting with the primaryobjective of simplifying it.As a result, the Group has discontinued\nthe use of the following non-IFRS measures: Proportionate financial obligations, Proportionate leverage, Proportionate leverage after leases, and all Underlying measures (as these mainly reflected the full consolidation of Guatemala).
