          "content": "Phase I/II AMT-130\nHuntington’s Disease\nProgram Update\nJuly 9, 2024\nDisclaimer\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, which are often indicated by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “look forward to,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” \"will,” “would” and similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.\nForward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information available to management only as of the date of this presentation. Examples of these\nforward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements concerning: our plans to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss the potential for expedited clinical development;\nthe timing of our planned meeting and discussions with regulatory authorities; our ability to continue accumulating long-term patient data; the potential clinical and functional effects of\nAMT-130; our plans to continue clinical development of AMT-130; the potential for accelerated regulatory pathways; our use of a natural history cohort as a basis for comparison with\nrespect to the efficacy of AMT-130; our enrollment plans with respect to the third cohort studying AMT-130 in combination with immunosuppression and our plans to present safety data\nfrom this cohort; the utility of NfL in CSF as an effective biomarker and indicator of clinical severity; and our plans to present further interim analyses. Because these statements are\nsubject to risks and uncertainties, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among others:\nrisks related to our clinical trials of AMT-130, including the risk that such trials will be unable to demonstrate data sufficient to support further clinical development and the risk that interim\ndata from the trials may not be predictive of later data readouts; risks related to our ability to pursue business development efforts with respect to AMT-130; risks related to our planned\ninteractions with regulatory authorities, which may affect the initiation, timing and progress of clinical trials and pathways to regulatory approval; risks related to our use of propensity-\nweighted external controls in connection with its statistical analysis of clinical outcomes to date, and whether regulatory authorities will accept our approach as a basis for accelerated\napproval; risks related to our use of nominal p values as a basis for its statistical analyses; whether the measurements that we are evaluating continue to be viewed as robust and\nsensitive measurements of disease progression; whether RMAT designation or any accelerated pathway, if granted, will lead to regulatory approval; our ability to conduct and fund a\nPhase III or confirmatory study for AMT-130; our ability to continue to build and maintain the infrastructure and personnel needed to achieve our goals; our effectiveness in managing\ncurrent and future clinical trials and regulatory processes; our ability to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of our gene therapy candidates in clinical trials; the continued development\nand acceptance of gene therapies; our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property; and our ability to fund our operations and to raise additional capital as needed and\non acceptable terms. These and other risks and uncertainties are described more fully under the heading “Risk Factors” in our periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), including in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024, and other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time.\nGiven these risks, uncertainties and other factors, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and, except as required by law, we assume no obligation to\nupdate these forward-looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nCertain information contained in this presentation relates to or is based on studies, publications, surveys and other data obtained from third-party sources and our own internal estimates\nand research. While we believe these third-party sources to be reliable as of the date of this presentation, we have not independently verified, and makes no representation as to the\nadequacy, fairness, accuracy or completeness of, any information obtained from third -party sources. Finally, while we believe our own internal research is reliable, such research has not\nbeen verified by any independent source.\nLEADERSHIP IN GENE THERAPY JULY 2024 | 2\nOpening\nRemarks\nMatt Kapusta\nChief Executive Officer\nSlowing progression of Huntington’s disease could extend\npatients' quality of life\nHD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with no disease-modifying treatments available.\nAMT-130 aims…\nUntreated disease course\n1\ng\nTo slow the rate of n Disease-modifying therapy\ni\nn\ndisease progression e\ns\nr\no\nw\ne\n2 s\na\nTo provide HD patients with e\ns\ni\nD\nan improved quality of life\nIllustration depicts potential benefits of disease modifying treatment.\nAbbreviations: HD, Huntington’s Disease.\nReferences: Ross CA, et al.

Imbalances in these factors at baseline can impact the\ninterpretation of outcomes.\n•2 Calculate Propensity Scores (PS): Use a logistic regression model with the selected covariates to estimate propensity scores, which quantify\nthe baseline similarity of individual subjects in the natural history cohort compared to the treatment group.\n•3 Weight External Control: The weight of treated subjects is 1.0; The weight of patients in the external control is calculated as PS/(1-PS).\n• 4 Evaluate Balance:Assess covariates between the treatment cohort and the external control to ensure effective balancing of baseline\ncharacteristics.\n(1) Prognostic factors include CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeats; CAP (CAG-Age-Product) Score; cUHDRS (composite Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale); DCL (diagnostic confidence level); PIN Score\n(Prognostic Index), and TFC (Total Function Capacity).\nLEADERSHIP IN GENE THERAPY JULY 2024 | 32\nReferences and abbreviations\nALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;\nCSF, cerebrospinal fluid;\ncUHDRS, composite Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale;\nFDA, Food & Drug Administration;\nHD, Huntington’s Disease;\nNfL, neurofilament light chain;\nNHC, natural history cohort;\nRMAT, regenerative medicine advanced therapy;\nSE, standard error;\nSDMT, Symbol Digit Modalities Test;\nSWT, Stroop Word Reading Test;\nTFC, Total Function Capacity;\nTMS, Total Motor Score;\nLEADERSHIP IN GENE THERAPY JULY 2024 | 33"
