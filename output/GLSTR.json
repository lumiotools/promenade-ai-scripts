Describing sales uptick of nearly 160% since October 2022, Spotter Co-Founder Tsogbadrakh Surenjargal said, “The growth has been phenomenal.” \n\nEach Spotter collar is fitted with Globalstar’s [SmartOne C satellite IoT transmitter](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globalstar.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproducts%2Fiot%2Fsmartone-c&esheet=54155995&newsitemid=20241121547825&lan=en-US&anchor=SmartOne+C+satellite+IoT+transmitter&index=5&md5=a523c70fa9c42a10ca18a4e505fed0f2), so the solution helps herd owners keep tabs on their valued equines wherever they travel in this sparsely populated region, even when well beyond the reach of cellular signals. With SmartOne C’s small size, versatility, and low price, Spotter is seeing rapid uptake of its lightweight, rugged, and economical tracking collars. \n\nThere’s a growing understanding among the horse owning community of the value and reliability of the satellite IoT technology solution, according to Surenjargal. “People are becoming aware that terrestrial telecoms infrastructure like mobile networks are simply unable to provide the ubiquitous and always-on tracking capability of satellite.” \n\nSpotter’s customers are further benefiting from recent expansion of Globalstar’s Eurasian ground station gateway network, now providing even greater reach and network resilience while enjoying the low maintenance, long battery life of the SmartOne C. \n\n“For people across Central Asia, horses are their livelihood as well as the living embodiment of their history and culture; we’re incredibly proud that Globalstar satellite IoT technology is helping owners track and safeguard their precious animals in one of the world's most desolate landscapes, and in the most extreme climatic conditions. Many congratulations, again, to our partners at Spotter,” commented Mark O’Connell, Globalstar General Manager for EMEA & APAC. \n\n**About Globalstar, Inc.**\n\nGlobalstar empowers its customers to connect, transmit, and communicate in smarter ways – easily, quickly, securely, and affordably – offering reliable satellite and terrestrial connectivity services as an international telecom infrastructure provider.

(NYSE American: GSAT) (“Globalstar” or the “Company”), a next-generation telecommunications infrastructure and technology provider, today announced its intent to transfer its common stock listing to the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “Nasdaq”) in the first quarter of 2025. In connection with this planned uplisting, the Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a reverse stock split of its common stock, which is also expected to take place in the first quarter of 2025 at a ratio to be determined closer to the effective date. The reverse stock split is intended to align trading fundamentals with peers, improve liquidity and attract greater investment participation from a more diverse and larger set of institutional investors. \n\nGlobalstar has submitted its application to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Company is working with Nasdaq to complete the transfer in connection with the effective date of the reverse stock split. The Company's common stock will continue trading on the NYSE American until the uplisting is complete. \n\n“This strategic decision to transfer to the Nasdaq, coupled with a reverse stock split, reflects the exciting momentum and strong growth trajectory in our business. With these changes, we expect to enhance our visibility, attract a more diverse and institutional shareholder base, and improve overall liquidity. At the same time, our reverse split will better align with trading dynamics and technical characteristics of our industry peers, which we expect will unlock value for our shareholders over the near and long-term. We look forward to discussing these initiatives in more detail at our upcoming investor day on December 12,” said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer of Globalstar. \n\n**About Globalstar, Inc.**\n\nGlobalstar empowers its customers to connect, transmit, and communicate in smarter ways – easily, quickly, securely, and affordably – offering reliable satellite and terrestrial connectivity services as an international telecom infrastructure provider.
