Bancorp reported a net loss of $72,000, or $0.02 per basic and diluted common share for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.44 per basic and diluted common share for the same period in 2023. On September 30, 2024, Bancorp had total assets of $368.4 million. Bancorp is the oldest independent commercial bank in Anne Arundel County.\n\n“The Company’s positive earnings results for the third quarter 2024 reflect efficient and productive operations, a focus on disciplined loan growth, and balance sheet management. However, our financial performance for the year 2024 is disappointing and represents the challenges inherent in navigating the interest rate environment of the last several years. The Company is focused on generating additional interest earning assets at higher current market and rebuilding our base of core, low-cost deposits,” said Mark C. Hanna, President, and Chief Executive Officer. “Despite the challenges of declining net interest income, the Company’s financial strength is reflected in a strong capital position, available liquidity and prudent expense management. Although interest expense increased significantly in year over year comparisons, prompt adjustments to rates on loans contributed to expanded interest income and higher yields on earning assets that partially offset higher interest expense and helped mitigate margin compression.”\n\nIn closing, Mr. Hanna added, “To invest in strategic opportunities that will benefit the long-term performance of the Bank, the difficult decision was made to change the longstanding practice of approving quarterly cash dividends for shareholders. As the Bank evaluates our next 75 years, we are committed to our business model and the economic strength of the communities we serve. To better serve the evolving needs of our clients, there is a need to reinvest in our people, technology, products and facilities. Based on our capital levels, conservative underwriting policies, on-and off-balance sheet liquidity, strong loan diversification, and current economic conditions within the markets we serve, management expects to navigate the uncertainties and remain well-capitalized. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to generate organic loan and deposit growth.”\n\n### Highlights for the First Nine Months of 2024\n\nDespite growth in loans and deposits in the first nine months of the year, net interest income decreased $1.1 million, or 11.54% to $8.2 million through September 30, 2024, as compared to $9.2 million during the same period of 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from a $2.4 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest on deposits was driven by the higher cost of money market deposit balances. The increase in interest on borrowings was driven by a $25.6 million increase in the average balance of borrowed funds due to the elevated level of deposit runoff that occurred in 2023.\n\nDue to growth of $30.7 million in the loan portfolio and a 0.11% increase in the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) percentage, the Company added $591,000 to its allowance for credit losses on loans in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to a $68,000 release of allowance for credit losses in the first nine months of 2023. While this provision negatively impacted earnings in the first half of the year, the growth in loan balances should generate additional interest revenue in future periods. The Company expects that its strong liquidity and capital positions, along with the Bank’s total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets of 16.72% on September 30, 2024, as compared to 18.10% for the same period of 2023, will provide ample capacity for future growth.\n\nReturn on average assets for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 0.14%, as compared to 0.61% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Return on average equity for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 2.63%, as compared to 12.47% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. Lower net income and a higher average asset balance primarily drove the lower return on average assets, while lower net income and a higher average equity balance primarily drove the lower return on average equity.\n\nThe cost of funds increased 0.86% when comparing September 30, 2024, to the same period in 2023, rising from 0.46% to 1.32%. This 0.86% increase was primarily due to the change in the funding mix between lower cost interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit balances and higher cost borrowed funds and money market deposit balances.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, the Bank remained above all “well-capitalized” regulatory requirement levels. The Bank’s tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was approximately 15.47% on September 30, 2024, as compared to 17.37% on December 31, 2023. Liquidity remained strong due to managed cash and cash equivalents, borrowing lines with the FHLB of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve and correspondent banks, and the size and composition of the bond portfolio.\n\n### Balance Sheet Review\n\nTotal assets were $368.4 million on September 30, 2024, an increase of $13.0 million or 3.66%, from $355.4 million on September 30, 2023. Investment securities decreased by $22.7 million or 15.94% to $120.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $142.7 million for the same period of 2023. Loans, net of deferred fees and costs, were $207.0 million on September 30, 2024, an increase of $32.2 million or 18.41%, from $174.8 million on September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents increased $7.9 million or 54.68%, from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024.\n\nTotal deposits were $314.2 million on September 30, 2024, a decrease of $600,000 or 0.18%, from $314.8 million on September 30, 2023. Despite the year-over-year decline, deposit balances have increased $14.2 million or 4.73% from December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $115.9 million on September 30, 2024, a decrease of $11.0 million or 8.64%, from $126.9 million on September 30, 2023. Interest-bearing deposits were $198.3 million on September 30, 2024, an increase of $10.4 million or 5.53%, from $187.9 million on September 30, 2023. Total borrowings were $30.0 million on September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.0 million or 20.00%, from $25.0 million on September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, total stockholders’ equity was $21.2 million (5.74% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $7.29 per common share. Total stockholders’ equity on September 30, 2023, was $13.2 million (3.70% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $4.57 per common share.\n\nAsset quality, which has trended within a narrow range over the past several years, has remained sound as of September 30, 2024. Nonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans to borrowers with financial difficulty, accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and other real estate owned (“OREO”), represented 0.08% of total assets on September 30, 2024, compared to 0.15% on December 31, 2023, demonstrating positive asset quality trends across the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $2.75 million, or 1.33% of total loans, as of September 30, 2024, compared to $2.16 million, or 1.22% of total loans, as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments was $597,000 as of September 30, 2024, compared to $473,000 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n### Review of Financial Results\n\n#### For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nNet income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $129,000, as compared to net income of $551,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a $614,000 increase in interest expense on deposits and a $126,000 increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings, a $287,000 decrease in interest and dividends on securities, a $170,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans and a $197,000 increase in noninterest expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $763,000 in loan interest income and fees, and a $133,000 increase in interest on deposits with banks. The Company’s need to defend its deposit base as well as grow interest-earning asset balances necessitated a strategic change in direction that resulted in the increased interest expense.\n\nNet interest income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, totaled $2.8 million, a decrease of $131,000 from the three-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to a $740,000 increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings driven by a $17.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing funds and a $16.6 million decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits. The higher expenses were partially offset by a $609,000 increase in total interest income due to a 0.66% increase in the yield of interest earning assets.\n\nNet interest margin for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 3.06%, compared to 3.21% for the same period of 2023. Higher average interest-bearing funds, lower average noninterest-bearing funds, and higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher average yields and balances on interest-earning assets were the primary drivers of year-over-year results. The average balance of interest-bearing funds and noninterest-bearing funds increased $17.3 million and decreased $16.6 million, respectively, and the cost of funds increased 0.86%, when comparing the three-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $0.8 million while the yield increased 0.66% from 3.64% to 4.30%, when comparing the three-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and investment securities decreased $25.3 million from $188.2 million to $162.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, while the yield remained unchanged during that same period.\n\nAverage loan balances increased $26.1 million to $203.3 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to $177.2 million for the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.89% from 4.80% to 5.69% during that same period. The increase in loan yields for the third quarter of 2024 reflected the runoff of the lower yielding loans and the origination of higher yielding loans in the current higher rate environment.\n\nThe provision of allowance for credit loss on loans for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $78,000, compared to a release of allowance for credit loss of $92,000 for the same period of 2023. The $170,000 increase in the provision for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects a $32.0 million increase in the reservable balance of the loan portfolio and a 0.13% increase in the current expected credit loss percentage.\n\nFor the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $3.0 million, compared to $2.8 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $200,000. The primary contributors to the $200,000 increase, when compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2023, were increases in legal, accounting, and other professional fees, data processing and item processing services, advertising and marketing related expenses, and other expenses (primarily allowance for unfunded commitments), offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits.\n\n#### For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\n\nNet loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $72,000, as compared to net income of $1.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a $460,000 decrease in interest and dividends on securities, a $1.0 million increase in interest expense on short-term borrowings, a $1.4 million increase in interest expense on deposits and a $780,000 increase in the provision for credit losses on loans, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in loan interest income and fees, a $535,000 increase in interest on deposits with banks and a $569,000 decrease in the provision for income taxes.\n\nNet interest income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, totaled $8.2 million, a decrease of $1.1 million from the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to a $2.4 million increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings driven by a $17.3 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing funds and a $20.0 million decrease in the average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits. The higher expenses were partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in total interest income due to a 0.51% increase in the yield of interest earning assets.\n\nNet interest margin for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, was 2.98%, compared to 3.35% for the same period of 2023. Higher average interest-bearing funds, lower average noninterest-bearing funds, and higher cost of funds, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets, were the primary drivers of year-over-year results. The average balance of interest-bearing funds and noninterest-bearing funds increased $17.3 million and decreased $20.0 million, respectively, and the cost of funds increased 0.94%, when comparing the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased $2.7 million, while the yield increased 0.51% from 3.59% to 4.10%, when comparing the nine-month periods ending September 30, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\n\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks and investment securities decreased $10.1 million from $187.9 million to $177.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.20% from 2.51% to 2.71% during that same period. The increase in yields is attributed to the higher interest rate environment and its positive impact on cash balances and investment yields.\n\nAverage loan balances increased $7.4 million to $188.6 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to $181.2 million for the same period of 2023, while the yield increased 0.72% from 4.70% to 5.42% during that same period. The increase in loan yields for the first nine months of 2024 reflected the runoff of the lower yielding loans and origination of higher yielding loans in the current higher rate environment.\n\nThe Company recorded a provision of allowance for credit loss on loans of $773,000 for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2024, compared to a release of allowance for credit loss of $7,000 for the same period in 2023. The $780,000 increase in the provision in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily reflects a $32.0 million increase in the reservable balance of the loan portfolio and a 0.13% increase in the current expected credit loss percentage. As a result, the allowance for credit loss on loans was $2.75 million on September 30, 2024, representing 1.33% of total loans, compared to $2.09 million, or 1.20% of total loans on September 30, 2023.\n\nFor the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense was $8.8 million, compared to $8.7 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023. The primary contributors when comparing to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, were increases in occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting, and other professional fees, advertising and marketing related expenses, and other expenses (primarily allowance for unfunded commitments), offset by decreases in salary and employee benefits costs.\n\n# # #\n\n### Glen Burnie Bancorp Information\n\nGlen Burnie Bancorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Glen Burnie, Maryland.

BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nGlen Burnie Bancorp (the “Company”) is a bank holding company organized in 1990 under the laws of the\nState of Maryland. The Company owns all the outstanding shares of capital stock of The Bank of Glen Burnie (the\n“Bank”), a commercial bank organized in 1949 under the laws of the State of Maryland, serving northern Anne Arundel\nCounty and surrounding areas from its main office and branch in Glen Burnie, Maryland and branch offices in Odenton,\nRiviera Beach, Crownsville, Severn (two locations), Linthicum and Severna Park, Maryland. The Bank also maintains\na remote Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) located in Pasadena, Maryland. The Bank maintains a website at\nwww.thebankofglenburnie.com. It is the oldest independent commercial bank in Anne Arundel County. The Bank is\nengaged in the commercial and retail banking business as authorized by the banking statutes of the State of Maryland,\nincluding the acceptance of demand and time deposits, and the origination of loans to individuals, associations,\npartnerships and corporations.\nThe Bank’s real estate financing consists of residential first and second mortgage loans, home equity lines of\ncredit and commercial mortgage loans. Commercial lending consists of both secured and unsecured loans. The Bank\nalso originates automobile loans through arrangements with local automobile dealers. The Bank’s deposits are insured\nup to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). We attract deposit customers from the\ngeneral public and use such funds, together with other borrowed funds, to make loans. Our results of operations are\nprimarily determined by the difference between interest income earned on our interest-earning assets, primarily interest\nand fee income on loans and investment securities, and interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits\nand borrowings.\nThe Company’s principal executive office is located at 101 Crain Highway, S.E., Glen Burnie, Maryland\n21061. Its telephone number at such office is (410) 766-3300.\nAVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION\nInformation on the Company and its subsidiary Bank may be obtained from the Company’s website\nwww.thebankofglenburnie.com. Copies of the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form\n10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto are available free of charge on the website as soon as\npracticable after they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a link to the SEC’s EDGAR\nreporting system. Simply select the “Investor Relations” menu item, then click on the “All SEC Filings” or “Insider\nTransactions” link.\nMARKET AREA\nThe Bank considers its principal market area for lending and deposit products to consist of Anne Arundel\nCounty, Maryland. Anne Arundel County includes the suburbs of the City of Baltimore and maintains a diverse set of\neconomic drivers such as a large international airport, the defense industry, a large number of large private sector\nemployers as well as telecommunications, retail, and distribution operations. The population of Anne Arundel County\nhas been growing steadily since 2011 and projected to continue such growth in 2024. The median age for Anne\nArundel County residents is 38.8 years. Management believes that the majority of the working population in its market\narea either commutes to Baltimore or is employed at businesses located at or around the nearby Baltimore Washington\nInternational Airport. Lending activities are broader, including the entire State of Maryland, and, to a limited extent,\nthe surrounding states. All of our revenue is generated within the United States.\n3\nCOMPETITION\nOur principal competitors for deposits are other financial institutions, including savings institutions,\ncommercial banks, credit unions, and local banks and branches or affiliates of other larger banks located in our primary\nmarket area. Competition among these institutions is based primarily on interest rates and other terms offered, service\ncharges imposed on deposit accounts, the quality of services rendered, and the convenience of banking facilities.\nAdditional competition for depositors' funds comes from mutual funds, U.S. Government securities, insurance\ncompanies and private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives for depositors such as\nsecurities firms. Competition from credit unions has intensified in recent years as historical federal limits on\nmembership have been relaxed. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from\nfederal income taxes, credit unions have a significant cost advantage over banks and savings associations, which are\nfully subject to federal income taxes. Credit unions may use this advantage to offer rates that are highly competitive\nwith those offered by banks and thrifts.\nThe Bank’s interest rates, loan and deposit terms, and offered products and services are impacted, to a large\nextent, by competition. With respect to indirect lending, the Bank faces competition from other banks and the\nfinancing arms of automobile manufacturers. We compete in this area by offering competitive rates and responsive\nservice to dealers. The Bank attempts to provide superior service within its community and to know, and facilitate\nservices to its customers. It seeks commercial relationships with small to medium size businesses, which the Bank\nbelieves would welcome personal service and flexibility. The Bank believes its greatest competition comes from larger\nintra- and inter-state financial institutions.\nSTRATEGY\nWe operate on the premise that the consolidation activities in the banking industry have created an opportunity\nfor a well-capitalized community bank to satisfy banking needs that are no longer being adequately met in the local\nmarket. Large national and regional banks are catering to larger customers and provide an impersonal experience,\nwhile typical community banks, because of their limited capacity, are able to meet the needs of many small-to-medium-\nsized businesses. Specifically, as a result of bank mergers, many banks in the Baltimore metropolitan area became\nlocal branches of large regional and national banks. Although size gave the larger banks some advantages in competing\nfor business from large corporations, including economies of scale and higher lending limits, we believe that these\nlarger, national banks remain focused on a mass market approach which de-emphasizes personal contact and service.\nWe also believe that the centralization of decision-making power at these large institutions has resulted in a lack of\ncustomer service. At many of these institutions, determinations are made at the out-of-state “home office\" by\nindividuals who lack personal contact with customers as well as an understanding of the customers' needs and scope of\nthe relationship with the institution. We believe that this trend is ongoing, and continues to be particularly frustrating to\nowners of small and medium-sized businesses, business professionals and individual consumers who traditionally have\nbeen accustomed to dealing directly with a bank executive who had an understanding of their banking needs with the\nability to deliver a prompt response.\nWe attempt to differentiate ourselves from the competition through personalized service, flexibility in meeting\nthe needs of customers, prompt decision making and the availability of senior management to meet with customers and\nprospective customers.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nGeneral\nOur primary market focus is on making loans to and gathering deposits from small and medium-sized\nbusinesses and their owners, professionals and executives, real estate investors and individual consumers in our primary\nmarket area. We lend to customers throughout Maryland, with our core market being Northern Anne Arundel County\nand surrounding areas of Central Maryland. To a limited extent, we lend to customers in neighboring states. The\nBank offers a full range of consumer and commercial loans. The Bank’s lending activities include residential and\ncommercial real estate loans, construction loans, land acquisition and development loans, commercial loans and\n4\nconsumer installment lending including indirect automobile lending. Substantially all of the Bank’s loan customers are\nresidents of Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of Central Maryland. The Bank solicits loan applications for\ncommercial loans from small to medium sized businesses located in its market area. The Company believes that this is\na market in which a relatively small community bank, like the Bank, has a competitive advantage in personal service and\nflexibility. The Bank’s consumer lending currently consists primarily of indirect automobile loans originated through\narrangements with local dealers.\nLending Activities\nCredit Policies and Administration\nThe Bank’s lending activities are conducted pursuant to written policies approved by the Board of Directors\n(“Board”) intended to ensure proper management of credit risk. Loans are subject to a well-defined credit process that\nincludes credit evaluation of borrowers, establishment of lending limits and application of lending procedures, including\nthe holding of adequate collateral and the maintenance of compensating balances, as well as procedures for on-going\nidentification and management of credit deterioration. Regular portfolio reviews are performed by the Bank’s senior\ncredit officer to identify potential underperforming loans and other credit facilities, to estimate loss exposure and to\nascertain compliance with the Bank’s policies. For significant problem loans, management review consists of\nevaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and any guarantor, the related collateral, and the effects of economic\nconditions.\nThe Bank’s loan approval policy provides for various levels of individual lending authority. The maximum\naggregate lending authority granted by the Bank to any one Lending Officer is $750,000. A combination of approvals\nfrom certain officers may be used to lend up to an aggregate of $1,000,000. We have adopted a comprehensive lending\npolicy, which includes stringent underwriting standards for all types of loans. Our lending staff follows pricing\nguidelines established periodically by our management team. The Bank maintains two committees, separate from the\nBoard of Directors, which have authorization to approve extensions of credit. The two committees are called the\nOfficer’s Loan Committee (“OLC”) and the Executive Committee (“EC”). The OLC is authorized to approve\nextensions of credit where the total aggregate amount of credit to the borrower or guarantor is less than or equal to\n$1,000,000. The OLC consists of the President/Chief Executive Officer (“President/CEO”), Chief Financial Officer\n(“CFO”), and Chief Lending Officer (“CLO”) plus two additional loan officers. The EC approves extensions of credit\nwhere the aggregate amount of credit to an existing borrower is less than or equal to $3,000,000. The EC is comprised\nof the Chairman of the Board, or the President/CEO plus two (2) outside Directors. Extensions of credit greater than\n$3,000,000 must be approved by the Board of Directors. Under the leadership of our executive management team, we\nbelieve that we employ experienced lending officers, secure appropriate collateral and carefully monitor the financial\nconditions of our borrowers and the concentration of loans in our portfolio.\nAll loans by the Bank to our directors and executive officers and their affiliates require pre-approval by the\nBank’s Board of Directors to ensure, among other things, compliance with Section 23A and Section 23B of the Federal\nReserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder. It is the Bank’s policy that all approved loans must be made on\nsubstantially the same terms as loans made to persons who are unrelated to the Bank.\nIn addition to the normal repayment risks, all loans in the portfolio are subject to the state of the economy and\nthe related effects on the borrower and/or the real estate market. Generally, longer-term loans have periodic interest\nrate adjustments and/or call provisions. Senior management through the collections department monitors the loan\nportfolio closely to ensure that we minimize past due loans and that we swiftly deal with potential problem loans.\nThe Bank also retains an outside, independent firm to review the loan portfolio. This firm performs a detailed\nannual review. We use the results of the firm’s report primarily to validate the risk ratings applied to loans in the\nportfolio and identify any systemic weaknesses in underwriting, documentation or management of the portfolio.\nResults of the annual review are presented to Executive Management, Audit Committee of the Board and the full Board\nof Directors and are available to and used by regulatory examiners when they review the Bank’s asset quality.\n5\nThe Bank maintains the normal checks and balances on the loan portfolio not only through the underwriting\nprocess but through the utilization of an internal credit administration group that both assists in the underwriting and\nserves as an additional reviewer of underwriting. The separately managed loan administration group also has oversight\nfor documentation, compliance and timeliness of collection activities. Our internal auditors also review documentation,\ncompliance and file management.\nReal Estate Lending\nThe Bank offers long-term mortgage financing for residential and commercial real estate as well as shorter term\nconstruction and land development loans. Residential mortgage and residential construction loans are originated with\nfixed rates, while commercial mortgages may be originated on either a fixed or variable rate basis. Commercial\nconstruction loans may be originated on either a fixed or a variable rate basis. Substantially all of the Bank’s real estate\nloans are secured by properties in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Under the Bank’s loan policies, the maximum\npermissible loan-to-value ratio for owner-occupied residential mortgages is 80% of the lesser of the purchase price or\nappraised value. With private mortgage insurance this limit may be higher than 80%. For residential investment\nproperties, the maximum loan-to-value ratio is 80%. The maximum permissible loan-to-value ratio for residential and\nresidential construction loans is 80%. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for permanent commercial mortgages is 75%.\nThe maximum loan-to-value ratio for land development loans is 70% and for unimproved land is 65%. The Bank also\noffers home equity loans secured by the borrower’s primary residence, provided that the aggregate indebtedness on the\nproperty does not exceed 80% of its value for loan commitments greater than $100,000. Because mortgage lending\ndecisions are based on conservative lending policies, the Company has no exposure to the credit issues affecting the sub-\nprime residential mortgage market.\nPrimary risks associated with residential real estate loans include fluctuating land and property values and rising\ninterest rates with respect to fixed-rate, long-term loans. Residential construction lending exposes the Company to\nrisks related to builder performance.\nCommercial Lending\nThe Bank’s commercial loan portfolio consists of demand, installment and time loans for commercial purposes.\nThe Bank’s business demand, installment and time lending includes various working capital loans, equipment, vehicles,\nlines of credit and letters of credit for commercial customers. Demand loans require the payment of interest until\ncalled, while installment loans require a monthly payment of principal and interest, and time loans require at maturity a\nsingle payment of principal and interest due monthly. Such loans may be made on a secured or an unsecured basis.\nAll such loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s creditworthiness rather than the value of the collateral.\nThe primary risks associated with commercial loans, including commercial real estate loans, are the quality of\nthe borrower’s management and a number of economic and other factors which induce business failures and depreciate\nthe value of business assets pledged to secure the loan, including competition, insufficient capital, product obsolescence,\nchanges in the borrowers’ cost, environmental hazards, weather, changes in laws and regulations and general changes in\nthe marketplace.\nInstallment Lending\nThe Bank makes consumer and commercial installment loans for the purchase of automobiles, boats, other\nconsumer durable goods, capital goods and equipment. Such loans provide for repayment in regular installments and\nare secured by the goods financed. Also included in installment loans are other types of credit repayable in\ninstallments.\nIndirect Automobile Lending\nThe Bank commenced its indirect lending program in January 1998. The Bank finances new and used\nautomobiles for terms of no more than 84 months. The Bank will lend a maximum of 90% of invoice on new vehicles.\nOn used vehicles, the Bank will lend no more than 90% of the average retail value as defined by a major national\n6\npublication approved by the Bank. The Bank requires all borrowers to obtain vendors single interest coverage\nprotecting the Bank against loss in the case a borrower’s automobile insurance lapses. The Bank originates indirect\nloans through a network of dealers which are primarily new car dealers located in Anne Arundel County and the\nsurrounding counties. Participating dealers take loan applications from their customers and transmit them to the Bank\nfor approval.\nIndirect automobile loans, are affected primarily by a variety of factors that may lead to the borrower’s\nunemployment, including deteriorating economic conditions in one or more segments of a local or broader economy.\nBecause the Bank deals with borrowers through an intermediary on indirect automobile loans, this form of lending\npotentially carries greater risks of defects in the application process for which claims may be made against the Bank.\nIndirect automobile lending may also involve the Bank in consumer disputes under state “lemon” or other laws. The\nBank seeks to control these risks by following strict underwriting and documentation guidelines. In addition,\ndealerships are contractually obligated to indemnify the Bank for such losses for a limited period of time.\nConsumer Lending\nWe offer various types of secured and unsecured consumer loans. Generally, our consumer loans are made for\npersonal, family or household purposes as a convenience to our customer base. As a general guideline, a consumer’s\ntotal debt service should not exceed 40% of their gross income. The underwriting standards for consumer loans include\na determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts and an assessment of his or her ability to meet existing\nobligations and payments on the proposed loan.\nConsumer loans may present greater credit risk than residential real estate loans because many consumer loans\nare unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciating assets. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may\nnot provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of\ndamage, loss or depreciation. Consumer loan collections also depend on the borrower’s continuing financial stability.\nIf a borrower suffers personal financial difficulties, the loan may not be repaid. Also, various federal and state laws,\nincluding bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount we can recover on such loans.\nPersonal Unsecured Lines\nThe Bank offers overdraft protection lines of credit, tied to checking accounts, as a convenience to qualified\ncustomers.\nLoan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing\nAll loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures, which incorporate standard\nunderwriting guidelines. We originate both fixed and variable rate loans. Our loan origination activity may be\nadversely affected by a rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand. We\noccasionally sell participations in commercial loans to correspondent banks if the amount of the loan exceeds our\ninternal limits. More rarely, we purchase loan participations from correspondent banks in the local market as well.\nThose loans are underwritten in-house with the same standards as loans directly originated.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority\nOur lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination\nprocedures established by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability\nto repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if\napplicable. To assess a business borrower’s ability to repay, we review and analyze, among other factors: current\nincome, credit history including the Bank’s prior experience with the borrower, cash flow, any secondary sources of\nrepayment, other debt obligations in regards to the equity/net worth of the borrower and collateral available to the Bank\nto secure the loan.\n7\nWe require appraisals or valuations of all real property securing one-to-four family residential and commercial\nreal estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit. All appraisers are state licensed or state certified appraisers,\nand a list of approved appraisers is maintained and updated on an annual basis.\nDeposit Activities\nDeposits are the major source of our funding. We offer a broad array of consumer and business deposit\nproducts that include demand, money market, and savings accounts, as well as time deposits and individual retirement\naccounts. We offer a competitive array of commercial cash management products, which allow us to attract demand\ndeposits. We believe that we pay competitive rates on our interest-bearing deposits. As a relationship-oriented\norganization, we generally seek to obtain deposit relationships with our loan clients.\nOther Banking Products\nWe offer our customers treasury services products that include wire transfer and ACH services, debit card and\nautomated teller machines and safe deposit boxes at all branches. In addition to traditional deposit services, we offer\ntelephone banking services, mobile banking, internet banking services and internet bill paying services to our customers.\nEMPLOYEES\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank had 84 full-time equivalent employees. Glen Burnie Bancorp does not\ncurrently have any employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered under a collective\nbargaining agreement. Management considers its employee relations to be excellent.\nSUPERVISON AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nThe Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal and state law. To the extent that the\nfollowing information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the\nparticular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect\non our business and our prospective business. Our operations may be affected by legislative changes and by the\npolicies of various regulatory authorities. We are unable to predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our\nbusiness and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, economic controls, or new federal or state legislation may have in\nthe future.\nThe Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the\n“BHCA”). As such, the Company is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n“Federal Reserve Board”) and subject to Federal Reserve Board regulation, examination, supervision and reporting\nrequirements. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve Board annual\nand quarterly reports of its operations at the end of each period and to furnish such additional information as the Federal\nReserve Board may require pursuant to the BHCA. The Company is also subject to regular inspection by Federal\nReserve Board examiners. As a publicly traded company whose common stock is registered under Section 12(g) of the\nExchange Act, we are under the jurisdiction of the SEC and subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC.\nWe are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies.\nAs a state-chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC but which is not a member of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (a “state non-member bank”), the Bank is subject to the supervision of the Maryland Commissioner of Financial\nRegulation (“Commissioner”) and the FDIC. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework\nof activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit\ninsurance funds and depositors, and not for the protection of stockholders. The Commissioner and FDIC regularly\nexamine the operations of the Bank, including but not limited to capital adequacy, assets, earnings, liquidity, sensitivity\nto market interest rates, reserves, loans, investments and management practices. In addition, the Bank is required to\n8\nfurnish quarterly Call Reports to the Commissioner and FDIC. The FDIC’s enforcement authority includes the power\nto remove officers and directors and the authority to issue cease-and-desist orders to prevent a bank from engaging in\nunsafe or unsound practices or violating laws or regulations governing its business.\nSome of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the Bank that are subject to regulation by the Federal\nReserve Board and the FDIC include disclosure requirements in connection with personal and mortgage loans and\nsavings deposit accounts. In addition, the Bank is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations which set\nforth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the establishment of branches, investments,\ninterest rates on loans, credit practices, the disclosure of customer information, the disclosure of credit terms and\ndiscrimination in credit transactions.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), which is one of 11 regional banks in the\nFederal Home Loan Bank System. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member\ninstitutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. The Bank is required to acquire and hold\nshares of capital stock of the FHLB as a condition of membership. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank was in\ncompliance with this requirement.\nConsumer Financial Protection Laws\nThe Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer financial protection laws and regulations that\nextensively govern its transactions with consumers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair\nCredit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement\nProcedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Service Members Civil Relief Act. The Bank must also\ncomply with applicable state usury laws and other laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These laws,\namong other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and the terms of deposit accounts, prohibit discrimination in\ncredit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, restrict the Bank’s ability to raise interest rates and\nsubject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of these laws may expose us to liability from potential\nlawsuits brought by affected customers. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer\nprotection agencies may also seek to enforce these consumer financial protection laws, in which case we may be subject\nto regulatory sanctions, civil money penalties, and customer rescission rights.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of financial\ninstitutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small\nfinancial institutions alike, including several provisions that profoundly affected the regulation of community banks,\nthrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies. Among other things, these provisions relaxed rules on interstate\nbranching, allow financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, and impose heightened capital\nrequirements on bank and thrift holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes several corporate governance\nprovisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions. These include provisions mandating\ncertain disclosures regarding executive compensation and provisions addressing proxy access by shareholders.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) as an independent\nentity within the Federal Reserve and transferred to the CFPB primary responsibility for administering substantially all\nof the consumer compliance protection laws formerly administered by other federal agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act\nalso authorizes the CFPB to promulgate consumer protection regulations that will apply to all entities, including banks\nthat offer consumer financial services or products. It also includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan\norigination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, and pre-\npayment penalties.\n9\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, including\nsome that may affect our business in substantial and unpredictable ways. We have incurred higher operating costs in\ncomplying with the Dodd-Frank Act, and we expect that these higher costs will continue for the foreseeable future.\nOur management continues to monitor the ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and as new regulations are\nissued, will assess their effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Volcker Rule\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and from\ninvesting and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The provision of the statute imposing these restrictions\nis commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” The regulations implementing the Volcker Rule require institutions to\nconform their activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, and to conform their investments in\ncertain “legacy covered funds” by July 21, 2017. These regulations exempt the Bank, as a bank with less than $10\nbillion in total consolidated assets that does not engage in any covered activities.\nLiquidity Requirements\nHistorically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a\nsupervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank\nholding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to\nliquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward\nwould be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that\nthe banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected\nnet cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity\nstress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more\nmedium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These\nrequirements are expected to incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other\nsovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.\nIn September 2015, the federal bank regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced\napproaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or\n$10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding\ncompanies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approach banking organizations,\nneither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank.\nBank Holding Company Act (BHCA)\nUnder the BHCA our activities are limited to business closely related to banking, managing, or controlling\nbanks. We are also subject to capital requirements applied on a consolidated basis in a form substantially similar to\nthose required of the Bank. The BHCA also requires a bank holding company to obtain approval from the Federal\nReserve before (i) acquiring, or holding more than 5% voting interest in any bank or bank holding company, (ii)\nacquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or\nconsolidating with another bank holding company. The BHCA also restricts non-bank activities to those which, by\nstatute or by Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of\nbanking or of managing or controlling banks.\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)\nThe GLBA removed barriers to affiliations among banks, insurance companies, the securities industry, and\nother financial service providers, and provides greater flexibility to these organizations in structuring such affiliations.\nThe GLBA also expanded the types of financial activities a bank may conduct through a financial subsidiary and\nestablished a distinct type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, which may engage in an\nexpanded list of activities that are “financial in nature.” These activities include securities and insurance brokerage,\nsecurities underwriting, insurance underwriting, and merchant banking. A bank holding company may become a\n10\nfinancial holding company only if all of its subsidiary financial institutions are well-capitalized and well-managed and\nhave at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rating. While we meet these standards, we do not\ncurrently intend to file notice with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded\nfinancial activities through a financial subsidiary of the Bank. The GLBA also includes privacy protections for\nnonpublic personal information held by financial institutions regarding their customers, and establishes a system of\nfunctional regulation that makes the Federal Reserve the “umbrella supervisor” for holding companies, and other federal\nand state agencies the supervisor of the holding company’s subsidiary.\nFinancial Privacy\nIn accordance with the GLBA, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other\nfinancial institutions to disclose non-public information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. These\nlimitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent\ndisclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLBA affect\nhow consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.\nWe are also subject to various state laws that generally require us to notify any customer whose personal financial\ninformation may have been released to an unauthorized person as the result of a breach of our data security policies and\nprocedures.\nUnder Maryland law, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any bank if the bank\nholding company would control more than 30% of the total deposits of all depository institutions in the State of\nMaryland unless waived by the Commissioner. The Maryland Financial Institutions Code prohibits a bank holding\ncompany from acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting stock of a bank or bank holding company without the\napproval of the Commissioner except as otherwise expressly permitted by federal law or in certain other limited\nsituations. The Maryland Financial Institutions Code additionally prohibits any person from acquiring voting stock in a\nbank or bank holding company without 60 days’ prior notice to the Commissioner if such acquisition will give the\nperson control of 25% or more of the voting stock of the bank or bank holding company or will affect the power to direct\nor to cause the direction of the policy or management of the bank or bank holding company. Any doubt whether the\nstock acquisition will affect the power to direct or cause the direction of policy or management shall be resolved in favor\nof reporting to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may deny approval of the acquisition if the Commissioner\ndetermines it to be anti-competitive or to threaten the safety or soundness of a banking institution. Voting stock\nacquired in violation of this statute may not be voted for five years.\nCapital Standards\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies approved final rules implementing the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision’s capital guidelines for all U.S. banks and for bank holding companies with\ngreater than $500 million in assets. The Federal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their\nexamination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels\nestablished by these guidelines, a bank holding company or bank must submit an acceptable plan for achieving\ncompliance with the capital guidelines and, until its capital sufficiently improves, will be subject to denial of applications\nand appropriate supervisory enforcement actions. Under these final rules, minimum requirements increased for both\nthe quantity and quality of capital held by the Company and the Bank. Federal regulations require federally insured\ndepository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets\nratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0%\nTier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The final rules also require a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation\nbuffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule.\nInstitutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent\nlimitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the\npayment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. A three-year phase in period for the capital buffer\nrequirement began in 2016. The capital buffer requirement effectively raised the minimum required common equity\nTier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5%, and the total capital ratio to 10.5%.\n11\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all\nassets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations) are multiplied by a risk weight factor\nassigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are\nrequired for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as\ncommon stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and\nadditional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related\nsurplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiary. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital\n(common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital\ninstruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-\nterm perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.\nAlso included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-\nweighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments\nspecified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only\nthese numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for\nindividual institutions where deemed necessary.\nThe final rules also increase the required capital for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk\nconstruction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations. The final rules adopt the risk weights for\nresidential mortgages under the existing general risk-based capital rules, which assign a risk weight of either 50% (for\nmost first-lien exposures) or 100% for other residential mortgage exposures.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nLoans-to-One Borrower\nUnder Maryland law, the maximum amount which the Bank is permitted to lend to any one borrower and their\nrelated interests may generally not exceed 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus, which is defined to include\nthe Bank’s capital, surplus, retained earnings and 50% of its allowance for possible credit losses. By interpretive ruling\nof the Commissioner of Financial Regulation, Maryland banks have the option of lending up to the amount that would be\npermissible for a national bank which is generally 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus (defined to include a bank’s total\ncapital for regulatory capital purposes plus any credit loss allowances not included in regulatory capital). As of December\n31, 2023, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.\nPrompt Corrective Action Regulations\nThe FDIC’s prompt corrective action regulations establish five capital levels for financial institutions (“well\ncapitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically\nundercapitalized”), and impose mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations on institutions that are less than adequately\ncapitalized. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was categorized as “well capitalized,” meaning that our total risk-based\ncapital ratio exceeded 10.00%, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 8.00%, our common equity Tier-1 risk-based\ncapital ratio exceeded 6.50%, our leverage ratio exceeded 5.00%, and we are not subject to a regulatory order,\nagreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions\nconstitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of\ncash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a bank holding\ncompany should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to\ncover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset\nquality, and overall financial condition.\n12\nBank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board notice of any purchase or redemption\nof their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the\nnet consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of\nthe bank holding company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or\nredemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order, directive,\nor any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Bank holding companies whose\ncapital ratios exceed the thresholds for “well capitalized” banks on a consolidated basis are exempt from the foregoing\nrequirement if they were rated composite 1 or 2 in their most recent inspection and are not the subject of any unresolved\nsupervisory issues.\nUSA Patriot Act of 2001\nThe USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) substantially broadened the scope of anti-money laundering\nlaws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions.\nThe regulations adopted by the Treasury under the Patriot Act require financial institutions to maintain appropriate\ncontrols to combat money laundering activities, perform due diligence of private banking and correspondent accounts,\nestablish standards for verifying customer identity, and provide records related to suspected anti-money laundering\nactivities upon request from federal authorities. A financial institution’s failure to comply with these regulations could\nresult in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, and could\nalso have other serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. We have established policies,\nprocedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. However, it is reasonable to anticipate that the\nUnited States Congress may enact additional legislation in the future to combat terrorism including modifications to\nexisting laws such as the Patriot Act to expand powers as deemed necessary. The enactment of the Patriot Act has\nincreased the Bank’s compliance costs, and the impact of any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon\nfinancial institutions is uncertain. However, such legislation would likely increase compliance costs and thereby\npotentially have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) requires that, in connection with examinations of financial\ninstitutions, federal banking regulators must evaluate the record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs of\ntheir local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound\noperation of the bank. Federal banking regulators are required to consider a financial institution’s performance in these\nareas as they review applications filed by the institution to engage in mergers or acquisitions or to open a branch or\nfacility. In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to\nenforcement proceedings. The Bank has a current rating of “satisfactory” for CRA compliance.\nInterstate Branching\nThe Dodd-Frank Act expanded the authority of a state or national bank to open offices in other states. A state\nor national bank may now open a de novo branch in a state where the bank does not already operate a branch if the law\nof the state where the branch is to be located would permit a state bank chartered by that state to open the branch. This\nprovision removed restrictions under prior law that restricted a state or national bank from expanding into another state\nunless the laws of the bank’s home state and the laws of the other state both permitted out-of-state banks to open de novo\nbranches.\nDividend Limitations\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends is limited by state and federal laws and regulations that require the\nBank to obtain prior approval before paying a dividend that, together with other dividends it has paid during a calendar\nyear, would exceed the sum of its net income year to date combined with its retained net income for the previous two\nyears. Pursuant to the Maryland Financial Institutions Code, Maryland banks may only pay dividends from undivided\nprofits or, with the prior approval of the Commissioner, their surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. The\nMaryland Financial Institutions Code further restricts the payment of dividends by prohibiting a Maryland bank from\n13\ndeclaring a dividend on its shares of common stock until its surplus fund equals the amount of required capital stock or,\nif the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, in an amount in excess of 90% of net earnings. In\naddition, the Bank is prohibited by federal statute from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution that\nwould cause the Bank to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements. Further, the FDIC also has authority to\nprohibit the payment of dividends by a state non-member bank when it determines such payment to be an unsafe and\nunsound banking practice.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) includes provisions intended to enhance corporate responsibility and\nprotect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws, and\nwhich increase penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies. The SOX generally\napplies to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nAmong other things, the SOX creates the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) as an\nindependent body subject to SEC supervision with responsibility for setting auditing, quality control, and ethical\nstandards for auditors of public companies. The SOX also requires public companies to make faster and more-\nextensive financial disclosures, requires the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of public companies to\nprovide signed certifications as to the accuracy and completeness of financial information filed with the SEC, and\nprovides enhanced criminal and civil penalties for violations of the federal securities laws.\nThe SOX also addresses functions and responsibilities of audit committees of public companies. The statute,\nby mandating certain stock exchange listing rules, makes the audit committee directly responsible for the appointment,\ncompensation, and oversight of the work of the company’s outside auditor, and requires the auditor to report directly to\nthe audit committee. The SOX authorizes each audit committee to engage independent counsel and other advisors, and\nrequires a public company to provide the appropriate funding, as determined by its audit committee, to pay the\ncompany’s auditors and any advisors that its audit committee retains. The SOX also requires public companies to\nprepare an internal control report and assessment by management, along with an attestation to this report prepared by the\ncompany’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their annual reports to stockholders.\nFDIC Deposit Insurance Assessment\nThe Dodd-Frank Act which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, changed how the FDIC calculates deposit\ninsurance premiums payable by insured depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to calculate the\ndeposit insurance assessments payable by each insured depository institution based generally upon the institution’s\naverage total consolidated assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Previously, an\ninstitution’s assessments were based on the amount of its insured deposits. The minimum deposit insurance fund rate\nincreased from 1.15% to 1.35% on September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase is borne by depository institutions\nwith assets of $10 billion or more. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides the FDIC with discretion to determine whether\nto pay rebates to insured depository institutions when its deposit insurance reserves exceed certain thresholds.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nA state non-member bank or its subsidiary may not engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate in\nan amount greater than 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and for all such transactions with all affiliates a\nstate non-member bank is limited to an amount equal to 20% of capital stock and surplus. All such transactions must\nalso be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank or subsidiary as those provided to a non-\naffiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and\nsimilar other types of transactions. An affiliate of a state non-member bank is any company or entity which controls or\nis under common control with the state non-member bank and, for purposes of the aggregate limit on transactions with\naffiliates, any subsidiary that would be deemed a financial subsidiary of a national bank. In a holding company\ncontext, the parent holding company of a state non-member bank (such as the Company) and any companies which are\ncontrolled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the state non-member bank. The BHCA further prohibits a\ndepository institution from extending credit to or offering any other services, or fixing or varying the consideration for\n14\nsuch extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution\nor certain of its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nLoans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Stockholders\nLoans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of a state non-member bank must be made on\nsubstantially the same terms as those prevailing for comparable transactions with persons who are not executive officers,\ndirectors, principal stockholders or employees of the Bank unless the loan is made pursuant to a compensation or benefit\nplan that is widely available to employees and does not favor insiders. Loans to any executive officer, director and\nprincipal stockholder together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests generally may not\nexceed 15% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus and all loans to such persons may not exceed the institution’s\nunimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their\nrespective affiliates, in excess of the greater of $100,000 or 5% of capital and surplus (up to $500,000) must be approved\nin advance by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Bank with any “interested” director not participating in the\nvoting. State non-member banks are prohibited from paying the overdrafts of any of their executive officers or\ndirectors. In addition, loans to executive officers may not be made on terms more favorable than those afforded other\nborrowers and are restricted as to type, amount and terms of credit.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nGlen Burnie Bancorp maintains a cyber risk management program that is designed to prevent, detect, and\nrespond to information security threats. The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of the Company’s\ninformation security program, which is designed and implemented by management under the direction of the Senior\nVice President, Director of Information Technology. In addition, the Internal Auditor and Compliance Officer consider\ncybersecurity threat risks alongside other company risks as part of our overall risk assessment and management process.\nThe Senior Vice President of Information Technology supervises the information security team, which is\nresponsible for maintaining and implementing our enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, standards, and\narchitecture processes. The Director of Information Technology, in coordination with compliance and human\nresources, conducts at least annual and ongoing company-wide information security awareness training . We have\ndeveloped processes to identify and oversee risks from cybersecurity threats associated with third-party service\nproviders, which include the information security team assessing cybersecurity robustness during vendor onboarding, the\ninclusion of protective provisions in vendor agreements, and risk-based monitoring of vendors on an ongoing basis.\nThe Board of Directors receives regular reports from the Senior Vice President, Director of Information\nTechnology and the Information Security Officer on Glen Burnie Bancorp’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects\nto strengthen Glen Burnie Bancorp’s information security systems, assessments of Glen Burnie Bancorp’s security\nprogram, and the emerging threat landscape. Additionally, the Information Technology Committee drives awareness,\nownership, and alignment across all business functions for effective cybersecurity risk management and reporting.\nGlen Burnie Bancorp annually engages third parties to audit its information security programs, whose findings are\nreported to the Audit and Information Technology Committees of the Board. The Company also engages with key\nvendors, industry participants, government agencies, and intelligence and law enforcement communities as part of our\nefforts, which are reported to the Information Technology Committee and Board of Directors.\nThe Company has experienced and expects that it will continue to experience cyber-based attempts to\ncompromise its information systems, although none, to its knowledge, has had a material adverse effect on its business,\nfinancial condition, or results of operations. Like all financial institutions, the Company faces the risks of such threats,\nthe consequences of which could be material. In addition, given the constant and evolving threat of cyber-based\nattacks, the Company incurs significant costs in its efforts to detect and prevent security breaches and incidents, and\nthese costs may increase in the future.\n15\nITEM 2.

The Company\nrecognizes the importance of dividends to its shareholders and intends to evaluate a variety of factors, on a quarterly basis,\nin determining whether dividend payments are prudent as well as the amount of the dividend. However, dividends remain\nsubject to declaration by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion and there can be no assurance that the Company will\nbe legally or financially able to make such payments. Payment of dividends may be limited by federal and state\nregulations which impose general restrictions on a bank’s and bank holding company’s right to pay dividends (or to make\nloans or advances to affiliates which could be used to pay dividends). Generally, dividend payments are prohibited unless\na bank or bank holding company has sufficient net (or retained) earnings and capital as determined by its regulators. See\n“Item 1.

This section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet interest income was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $11.9 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022. Total interest income increased from $12.7 million in 2022 to $13.3 million in 2023, a\n4.92% increase. Interest expense for 2023 totaled $1.2 million, a 40.91% increase from $0.9 million in 2022. Net\nincome for 2023 was $1.4 million, and for 2022 was $1.7 million.\n19\nCOMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND 2022\nGeneral. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported consolidated net income of $1.4\nmillion ($0.50 per basic and diluted earnings per share) compared to consolidated net income of $1.7 million ($0.61 per\nbasic and diluted earnings per share) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $316,000 decrease in the 2023\nconsolidated net income as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a $208,000 increase in the provision of credit loss\nallowance, a $206,000 decrease in gain on swap contract termination and a $304,000 increase in salary and employee\nbenefits expense that were partially offset by a $276,000 increase in net interest income and a $168,000 reduction in\nincome tax expense for 2023.\nAnnualized return on average assets was 0.40% at December 31, 2023 compared to 0.41% at December 31,\n2022. Annualized return on average equity was 8.35% and 7.26% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\ndividend payout ratio was 80% for December 31, 2023 and 65% for December 31, 2022. The equity to asset ratio was\n5.49% and 4.21% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. The primary component of the Company’s net income is its net interest income, which\nis the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits and borrowings used to fund income\nproducing assets. Net interest income is determined by the spread between the yields earned on the Company’s\ninterest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities as well as the relative amounts of such assets and\nliabilities.\nThe Company’s net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by the Company’s average\ninterest-earning assets.\nNet interest income is affected by the mix of loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio. Currently, a majority of the\nBank’s loans are residential and commercial mortgage loans secured by real estate, and indirect automobile loans\nsecured by automobiles.\nConsolidated net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $12.1 million and $11.9 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022. Total interest income increased from $12.7 million in 2022 to $13.3 million in\n2023, a $625,000, or 4.92% increase, primarily due to a $744,000 increase in interest and dividends on securities and a\n$122,000 increase in interest and fees on loans that were partially offset by a $241,000 decrease in interest on deposits\nwith banks and federal funds sold.\nTotal interest expense increased from $0.9 million in 2022 to $1.2 million in 2023, a $349,000 or 40.91%\nincrease, primarily due to a $341,000 increase in interest on short-term borrowings and a $42,000 increase in interest on\ndeposits that were partially offset by a $34,000 decrease in long-term borrowings. Net interest margin for the year\nended December 31, 2023 was 3.31% compared to 2.81% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n20\nThe following table allocates changes in income and expense attributable to the Company’s interest-earning\nassets and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated between changes due to changes in rate and changes in\nvolume.

Effective January 1, 2021, the Company applied ASU 2016-13, Financial\nInstruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"), such that the allowance calculation is based on the CECL methodology. Prior\nto January 1, 2021, the calculation was based on incurred loss methodology. The Company maintains an allowance for\ncredit losses (“ACL”) for the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio as well as unfunded loan commitments. The\namount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by management. The CECL methodology requires an\nestimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures) and replaces the incurred loss\nmethodology’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable a loss event was incurred.\nThe ACL consists of the allowance for credit losses - loans and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The\nestimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts.\nHistorical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider\nwhether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at\nthe reporting date that did not exist over the period that historical experience was based for each loan type. Finally, we\nconsider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable.\nPortfolio segment is defined as the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic\nmethodology to determine its ACL. The Company has designated three loan portfolio segments: loans secured by real\nestate, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans. These loan portfolio segments are further disaggregated\ninto classes, which represent loans of similar type, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and assessing credit\nrisk. The loans secured by real estate portfolio segment is disaggregated into five classes: construction and land,\nfarmland, single-family residential, multi-family, and commercial. The commercial and industrial loan portfolio\nsegment is disaggregated into two classes: commercial and industrial, and SBA guaranty. The risk of loss for the\ncommercial and industrial loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by the credit risk rating assigned to each\nborrower. Commercial and industrial loan risk ratings are determined by experienced senior credit officers based on\nspecific facts and circumstances and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists.\nThe consumer loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into two classes: consumer and automobile. The risk of loss for\nthe consumer loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by delinquency status and general economic factors.\nEach of the three loan portfolio segments may also be further segmented based on risk characteristics.\nFor most of our loan portfolio classes, the historical loss experience is determined using the Average Charge-\nOff Method. This method pools loans into groups (“cohorts”) sharing similar risk characteristics and tracks each\ncohort’s net charge-offs over the lives of the loans. The Average Charge-Off Method uses historical values by period\n(20-year look-back) to calculate losses and then applies the historical average to future balances over the life of the\naccount. The historical loss rates for each cohort are then averaged to calculate an overall historical loss rate which is\napplied to the current loan balance to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the\nrespective loan portfolio class. For certain loan portfolio classes, the Company determined there was not sufficient\nhistorical loss information to calculate a meaningful historical loss rate using the average charge-off methodology. For\nany such loan portfolio class, peer group history contributes to the Company’s weighted average loss history. The peer\ngroup data is included in the weighted average loss history that is developed for each loan pool.\nThe Company also considers qualitative adjustments to the historical loss rate for each loan portfolio class.\nThe qualitative adjustments for each loan class consider the conditions over the 20-year look-back period from which\nhistorical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or\ncurrent conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit\nculture and management, business environment or other management factors; and 2) reasonable and supportable\nforecast of future economic conditions and collateral values.\nThe Company performs a quarterly asset quality review which includes a review of forecasted gross charge-offs\nand recoveries, nonperforming assets, criticized loans, risk rating migration, delinquencies, etc. The asset quality\nreview is performed by management and the results are used to consider a qualitative overlay to the quantitative\nbaseline.\n23\nWhen management deems it to be appropriate, the Company establishes a specific reserve for individually\nevaluated loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in each respective loan pool. These\nindividually evaluated loans are removed from their respective pools and typically represent collateral dependent loans\nbut may also include other non-performing loans or loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a credit loss provision - loans of $0.1\nmillion, compared to a release of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily\ndriven by a change in the loan portfolio mix combined with higher loss rates. The allowance for credit losses - loans\nwas $2.2 million, or 1.22% of total loans at December 31, 2023, compared to $2.2 million, or 1.16% of total loans at\nDecember 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses - loans equaled 409.5% of nonaccrual and\npast due loans compared to 434.0% at December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company\nrecorded net charge offs of $0.1 million compared to net charge offs of $0.2 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, other fees and\ncommissions, net gains/losses on investment securities sold, income on life insurance policies and gain on unwind of\nderivative contracts. Noninterest income decreased from $1.4 million in 2022 to $1.1 million in 2023, a $254,000, or\n18.76% decrease. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.2 million gain on unwind of derivative swap contracts that\nwas recognized in 2022 and a $54,000 decline in other fees and commissions earned in 2023 compared to 2022.\nNoninterest Expenses. Noninterest expenses increased from $11.3 million in 2022 to $11.6 million in 2023,\na $298,000 or 2.63% increase. Salary and employee benefits increased by $0.3 million, or 4.75%, to $6.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to $6.4 million at December 31, 2022. FDIC insurance costs rose by $51,000, or\n45.74% to $0.2 million while other expenses decreased from $1.3 million at December 31, 2022 to $1.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, a decrease of $100,000 or 7.67%.\nIncome Taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of\n$72,000, compared to $240,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, a $168,000 or 70.16% decrease. This decrease\nwas primarily due to $484,000, or 24.41% lower income before taxes in 2023.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets decreased by $29.6 million, or 7.77% to $351.8 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $381.4\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily a result of decreases in interest-bearing deposits in other\nfinancial institutions, in the loan portfolio and the investment securities available for sale portfolio.\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were $15.2 million compared to $30.1 million at December\n31, 2022. Loans, net at December 31, 2023 were $174.2 million compared to $184.3 million at December 31, 2022, a\ndecrease of $10.1 million or 5.50%. At year-end 2023, investment securities had decreased $4.7 million, or 3.27% to\n$139.4 million compared to year end 2022. At December 31, 2023, total deposits were $300.1 million compared to\n$362.9 million at the end of 2022, a 17.32% decrease during the period. Total borrowings were $30.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to $0 at December 31, 2022.\nCash\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $14.9 million primarily due to a $62.9 million decrease in deposit\nbalances that was partially offset by a $30.0 million increase in borrowings and a $10.1 million decrease in loans net of\ndeferred fees and costs and a $4.7 million decrease in investment securities.\n24\nInvestment Securities\nThe Company’s investment policy authorizes management to invest in traditional securities instruments in order\nto provide ongoing liquidity, income and a ready source of collateral that can be pledged in order to access other sources\nof funds. The investment portfolio consists solely of securities available for sale. Securities available for sale are\nthose securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily until maturity. These\nsecurities are carried at fair value and may be sold as part of an asset/liability management strategy, liquidity\nmanagement, interest rate risk management, regulatory capital management or other similar factors.\nThe investment portfolio consists primarily of U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government\nagency securities, municipal obligations and U.S. Treasury securities. The income from state and municipal obligations\nmay be taxable or tax-exempt from federal and state income tax. State and municipal obligations from the State of\nMaryland are exempt from federal and state income taxes. We use the investment portfolio as a source of both liquidity\nand earnings. Management continuously evaluates investment options that will produce income without assuming\nsignificant credit or interest rate risk and looks for opportunities to use liquidity from maturing investments to reduce our\nuse of high-cost time deposits and borrowed funds.\nDuring 2023, the Company’s investment securities portfolio totaled $139.4 million, a $4.7 million, or 3.27%\ndecrease from $144.1 million at December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by $18.5 million of paydowns\nand redemptions of investment securities, offset by $9.7 million of purchases of available for sale securities and a $4.0\nmillion decrease in the unrealized loss on available for sale securities during 2023.\nThe composition of investment securities, at carrying value, at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented in\nthe following table:\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands) Amount % Amount %\nAvailable for sale securities:\nU.S. Treasury $ 6,945 5.0 % $ 6,783 4.7 %\nU.S. Government agency 37,694 27.0 % 36,580 25.4 %\nResidential mortgage-backed securities 59,775 42.9 % 67,148 46.6 %\nState and municipal 33,729 24.2 % 32,297 22.4 %\nCorporate securities 1,284 0.9 % 1,325 0.9 %\nTotal debt securities $ 139,427 100.0 % $ 144,133 100.0 %\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had municipal securities from seven single issuers that, individually, were\nmore than 10% of stockholders’ equity, which totaled $28.6 million.\n25\nMaturities and weighted average yields for investment securities at December 31, 2023 are presented in the\nfollowing table:\n2023\nAmortized Fair Yield\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Value (1), (2)\nMaturing Available for sale securities:\nWithin one year $ 21,011 $ 20,776 2.46 %\nOver one to five years 7,351 6,803 1.70 %\nOver five to ten years 33,385 30,058 2.22 %\nOver ten years 103,040 81,790 2.45 %\nTotal debt securities $ 164,787 $ 139,427 2.37 %\n________________________\n(1) Yields are stated as book yields which are adjusted for amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts,\nrespectively.\n(2) Yields on tax-exempt obligations have been computed on a tax-equivalent basis.\nRestricted Equity Securities\nRestricted equity securities were $1.2 million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLoans\nA comparison of the loan portfolio for the years indicated is presented in the following table:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in thousands) $ % $ % $ % $ % $ %\nLoans Secured by Real Estate\nConstruction and land $ 4,636 3 % $ 4,499 2 % $ 4,087 2 % $ 2,553 1 % $ 6,565 2 %\nFarmland 325 — 333 — 342 — 350 — 357 —\nSingle-family residential 86,887 49 80,251 43 78,119 37 82,520 33 88,214 32\nMulti-family 5,165 3 5,304 3 5,428 3 6,105 2 6,397 2\nCommercial 39,217 22 42,936 23 48,729 23 57,027 22 63,337 22\nTotal loans secured by real\nestate 136,230 77 133,323 71 136,705 65 148,555 58 164,870 58\nCommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial 10,850 6 8,990 5 10,003 5 10,800 4 11,012 4\nSBA guaranty 5,924 4 6,158 3 6,397 3 7,200 3 3,917 1\nComm SBA PPP — — — — 1,047 — 9,912 4 — —\nTotal commercial and\nindustrial loans 16,774 10 15,148 8 17,447 8 27,912 11 14,929 5\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer 2,039 1 1,521 1 2,090 1 3,063 1 3,267 1\nAutomobile 21,264 12 36,448 20 54,150 26 74,242 30 101,672 36\nTotal consumer loans 23,303 13 37,969 21 56,240 27 77,305 31 104,939 37\nGross loans 176,307 100 % 186,440 100 % 210,392 100 % 253,772 100 % 284,738 100 %\nAllowance for credit losses (2,157) (2,162) (2,470) (1,476) (2,066)\nNet loans $ 174,150 $ 184,278 $ 207,922 $ 252,296 $ 282,672\nThe Company’s net loan receivables decreased by $10.1 million to $174.2 million at December 31, 2023 from\n$184.3 million at December 31, 2022 primarily due to $35.3 million in pay downs outpacing $25.2 million in new\noriginations. This change in the composition of the loan portfolio resulted primarily from a $15.2 million decrease in\nautomobile loans and a $3.7 million decrease in commercial real estate loans.\n26\nThe following table summarizes the scheduled repayments of our loan portfolio, both by loan category and by\nfixed and adjustable rates, at December 31, 2023.

Placing a loan on nonaccrual\nstatus means that we no longer accrue interest on such loan and reverse any interest previously accrued but not collected.\nManagement may grant a waiver from nonaccrual status for a 90 day past due loan that is both well secured and in the\nprocess of collection. An asset is “well secured” if it is secured by (1) collateral in the form of liens on or pledges of\nreal or personal property, including securities that have a realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt (including\naccrued interest) in full, or (2) the guarantee of a financially responsible party. An asset is “in the process of\ncollection” if collection of the asset is proceeding in due course either (1) through legal action, including judgment\nenforcement procedures, or (2) in appropriate circumstances, through collection efforts not involving legal action\nwhich are reasonably expected to result in prepayment of the debt or in its restoration to a current status in the near\nfuture. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest and the\nborrower demonstrates the ability to make payments in accordance with the terms of the loan and remains current.\nA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will\nbe unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are\nmeasured based on the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and at the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows using the loans’ effective interest rates for loans that are not collateral dependent.\nThe Bank seeks to control delinquencies through diligent collection efforts. For consumer loans, the Bank\nsends out payment reminders on the seventh and twelfth days after a payment is due. If a consumer loan becomes 15\ndays past due, the account is transferred to the Bank’s collections department, which will contact the borrower by\n27\ntelephone and/or letter before the account becomes 30 days past due. If a consumer loan becomes more than 30 days\npast due, the Bank will continue its collection efforts and will move to repossession or foreclosure by the 45th day if the\nBank has reason to believe that the collateral may be in jeopardy or the borrower has failed to respond to prior\ncommunications. The Bank may move to repossess or foreclose in all instances in which a consumer loan becomes\nmore than 60 days delinquent. After repossession of a motor vehicle, the borrower has a 15-day statutory right to\nredeem the vehicle and is entitled to 10 days’ notice before the sale of a repossessed vehicle. The Bank sells the\nvehicle as promptly as feasible after the expiration of these periods. If the amount realized from the sale of the vehicle\nis less than the loan amount, the Bank may seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower. The Bank follows similar\ncollection procedures with respect to commercial loans.\nOur current charge-off policy is as follows:\nWhen the probability for full payment of a loan is unlikely, the Bank will initiate a full charge-off or a partial\nwrite-down of the asset based upon the status of the loan. The following guidelines apply:\n• Consumer loans less than $25,000 for which payments of principal and/or interest are past due ninety (90)\ndays are charged-off and referred for collection. Consumer loans of $25,000 or more shall be evaluated\nfor charge-off or partial write-down at the discretion of Bank management.\n• Any other loan over 120 days past due shall be evaluated for charge-off or partial write-down at the\ndiscretion of Bank management. Any non-consumer unsecured loan more than 180 days delinquent in\npayment of principal and/or interest (or sooner if deemed uncollectible) is charged-off in full.\n• If secured, a charge-off is made to reduce the loan balance to a level equal to the anticipated liquidation\nvalue of the collateral when payment of principal and/or interest is more than 180 days delinquent, or prior\nto that if deemed uncollectible.\n• Generally, real estate secured loans are charged-off on a deficiency basis after liquidation of the collateral.\nIn some cases, Bank management may determine that a charge-off or write-down is appropriate prior to\nliquidation of the collateral, when the full loan balance is clearly uncollectible and some loss is anticipated.\nIn order to make this determination, an updated evaluation or appraisal of the property is obtained.\nThe Bank experienced a $29,000 or 5.8% increase in the total nonperforming loans in 2023. The following\ntable presents details of our nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, as these asset quality metrics are evaluated\nby management, for the years indicated:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans $ 527 $ 488 $ 338 $ 4,512 $ 4,127\nAccruing loans past due 90+ days - 10 15 18 21\nTotal nonperforming loans 527 498 353 4,530 4,148\nReal estate acquired through foreclosure - - - 575 705\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 527 $ 498 $ 353 $ 5,105 $ 4,853\nNonperforming loans to gross loans 0.3 % 0.3 % 0.2 % 1.8 % 1.5 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 409.5 % 434.0 % 700.3 % 32.6 % 49.8 %\nNonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty,\naccruing loans past due 90 days or more, and real estate acquired through foreclosure, remained essentially unchanged at\n$0.5 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Nonperforming assets represented 0.15% of total assets at\n28\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to 0.13% at December 31, 2022. Management has worked diligently to identify\nborrowers that may be facing difficulties in order to restructure terms where appropriate, secure additional collateral or\npursue foreclosure and other secondary sources of repayment.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans and Credit Risk Management\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower to meet his or her obligations and entails\nboth general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending, and risks specific to individual borrowers. Credit risk\nis mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to any single customer, industry, or collateral type.\nResidential mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience. Loans secured\nby personal property, such as auto loans, generally experience medium credit losses. Unsecured loan products, such as\npersonal revolving credit, have the highest credit loss experience and for that reason, the Bank has chosen not to engage\nin a significant amount of this type of lending. Credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a\npercentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing\neconomic conditions. Generally, improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of\ncommercial customers, enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements. Improvements, if any,\nin operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic\ntimes. Inconsistent economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers,\nreducing their ability to meet debt service obligations.\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC\n326”) which replaces the “incurred loss approach” for estimating credit losses with an expected loss methodology. The\nincurred loss model delayed the recognition of credit losses until it was probable that a loss had occurred, while the\nCECL model requires the immediate recognition of expected credit losses over the contractual term for financial\ninstruments that fall within the scope of CECL at the date of origination or purchase of the financial instrument. The\nCECL model, which is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet credit exposures, affects the Company’s estimates of the allowance for credit losses for our loan\nportfolio and the reserve for our off-balance sheet credit exposures related to loan commitments. The allowance for\ncredit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the\nallowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The\nallowance, based on all available information from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing the collectability\nof loans over their contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate, is an amount that\nmanagement believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The\nevaluations are performed for each class of loans and take into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and\nvolume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, value of collateral securing the\nloans and current economic conditions and trends that may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay. For example,\ndelinquencies in unsecured loans and indirect automobile installment loans will be reserved for at significantly higher\nratios than loans secured by real estate. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions or\nchanges in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable. Based on that analysis, the Bank deems its allowance\nfor credit losses in proportion to the total nonaccrual loans and past due loans to be sufficient.\nThe allowance was $2.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $2.2 million at December 31, 2022. The\nallowance as a percentage of total portfolio loans was 1.22% at December 31, 2023 and 1.16% at December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded net charge offs of $0.1 million compared to\n$0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n29\nThe following table reflects activity in the allowance for credit losses - loans for the periods indicated:\nYear E n de d Decem be r 31,\n2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in thousands)\nBeginning Balance $ 2,162 $ 2,470 $ 1,476 $ 2,066 $ 2,541\nImpact of ASC 326 adoption — — 1,574 — —\nLoans charged-off\nLoans Secured by Real Estate\nConstruction and land — — — — —\nFarmland — — — — —\nSingle-family residential — — — — 16\nMulti-family — — — — —\nCommercial — — — — —\nTotal loans secured by real estate — — — — 16\nCommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial — 200 — — 27\nSBA guaranty — 9 — — —\nComm SBA PPP — — — — —\nTotal commercial and industrial loans — 209 — — 27\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer 79 14 2 — —\nAutomobile 123 169 251 392 573\nTotal consumer loans 203 183 253 392 573\nTotal 203 392 253 392 616\nRecoveries\nLoans Secured by Real Estate\nConstruction and land — — — — —\nFarmland — — — — —\nSingle-family residential — — 408 266 4\nMulti-family — — — — —\nCommercial — — — — —\nTotal loans secured by real estate — — 408 266 4\nCommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial — — — 20 10\nSBA guaranty — — — — —\nComm SBA PPP — — — — —\nTotal commercial and industrial loans — — — 20 10\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer 1 8 — 6 10\nAutomobile 101 188 240 199 232\nTotal consumer loans 102 196 240 205 242\nTotal 102 196 648 491 256\nNet charge offs (recoveries) 101 196 (1,969) (99) 360\n(Release) provisions for credit loss 96 (112) (975) (689) (115)\nBalance at end of year $ 2,157 $ 2,162 $ 2,470 $ 1,476 $ 2,066\nAllowance as a percentage of total\nloans at the end of the year 1.22 % 1.16 % 1.17 % 0.58 % 0.73 %\nNet charge offs (recoveries) as a percentage of\naverage loans during the year 0.06 % 0.10 % (0.84) % (0.04) % 0.12 %\n30\nThe following table reflects the amount and percentage of credit loss allowance for each category for the\nperiods indicated:\nAt De cem ber 31,\n2023 2022\nPercentage Percentage\nOf Loans Of Loans\nAllowance In Each Allowance In Each\nFor Each Category To For Each Category To\nPortfolio Category Total Loans Category Total Loans\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoans Secured by Real Estate\nConstruction and land $ 31 2.6 % $ 44 2.4 %\nFarmland 18 0.2 20 0.2\nSingle-family residential 1,290 49.3 1,230 43.1\nMulti-family 96 2.9 103 2.8\nCommercial 190 22.2 221 23.0\nTotal loans secured by real estate 1,625 77.2 1,618 71.5\nCommercial and Industrial\nCommercial and industrial 304 6.1 174 4.8\nSBA guaranty 21 3.4 22 3.3\nTotal commercial and industrial loans 325 9.5 196 8.1\nConsumer Loans\nConsumer 30 1.2 23 0.8\nAutomobile 177 12.1 325 19.6\nTotal consumer loans 207 13.3 348 20.4\nTotal $ 2,157 100.0 % $ 2,162 100.0 %\nDeposits\nThe funds needed by the Bank to make loans are primarily generated by deposit accounts solicited from the\ncommunities in Anne Arundel County.

The Bank’s total credit availability is $88.8 million at December 31, 2023 and it\nmay draw $29.4 million which is secured by a floating lien on the Bank’s residential first mortgage loans.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Bank was permitted to draw on a line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank\nunder the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”). Credit is available up to the total value of investment securities\npledged as collateral. Borrowings under the line are secured by investment securities of $13.2 million at December 31,\n2023 and the outstanding loan balance is $10.0 million.\nThe Bank has available unsecured federal funds lines of credit from two financial institutions for $9.0 million\nand $8.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\n32\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmple capital is necessary to sustain growth, provide a measure of protection against unanticipated declines in\nasset values and safeguard the funds of depositors. Capital also provides a source of funds to meet loan demand and\nenables us to manage assets and liabilities effectively.\nStockholders’ equity increased to $19.3 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $16.1 million at December\n31, 2022. The $3.3 million, or 20.37%, increase for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted primarily from a $2.9\nmillion decrease in net unrealized losses on the available for sale bond portfolio, $1.4 million in net income and\n$120,000 stock issuances under the dividend reinvestment program that were partially offset by $1.1 million in\ndividends paid. The book value of the Company’s common stock was $6.70 at December 31, 2023 and $5.60 at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary\nactions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital\nguidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated\nunder regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments\nby the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nThe capital requirements to which the Bank is subject are known as the Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These Basel III Capital Rules and have been applicable to\nthe Bank since January 1, 2015.\nSpecifically, the rule imposes the following minimum capital requirements to be considered adequately\ncapitalized:\n• A common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.50%;\n• A Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.00%;\n• A total risk-based capital ratio of 8.00%; and\n• A leverage ratio of 4.00%.\nUnder the rule, common equity Tier 1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (which\nincludes all unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities and all unrealized net gain or\nloss on defined benefit pension plan), subject to a one-time opt-out election. The Bank elected to opt-out of this\nprovision. As such, accumulated comprehensive income is not included in determining the Bank’s regulatory capital\nratios.\nThe rule also includes risk weights of assets to reflect credit risk and other risk exposures. These include a\n150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisitions, development and construction loans and\nnon-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise on nonaccrual status, a 20% credit conversion\nfactor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally\ncancellable, a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital and increased\nrisk weights (from 0% to up to 600%) for certain equity exposures.\nFinally, the rule limits capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking\norganization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.50% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk\nweighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nFor regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards (net of any related valuations allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities) are excluded from regulatory\n33\ncapital, in addition to certain overall limits on net deferred tax assets as a percentage of common equity Tier 1 capital.\nAt December 31, 2023, none of the Bank’s net deferred tax asset was excluded from common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and\ntotal regulatory capital. We will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis\nfor both financial reporting and regulatory capital purposes. This evaluation may result in the inclusion of a deferred\ntax asset in regulatory capital in an amount that is different from the amount determined under GAAP.\nIn addition, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 capital to average total assets excluding\nintangibles. This measure is known as the leverage ratio. The current regulatory minimum for the leverage ratio for\ninstitutions to be considered “well capitalized” is 5.00%, but an individual institution could be required to maintain a\nhigher level.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain\namounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total, common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the\nregulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average tangible\nassets (as defined). At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank had regulatory capital in excess of that required under\neach requirement and was classified as “well capitalized”.\nActual capital amounts and ratios for the Bank are presented in the following tables (dollars in thousands):\nT o Be Well Ca pitalized\nTo Be Considered Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Adequately Capitalized Action Provisions\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 37,975 17.37 % $ 9,840 4.50 % $ 14,213 6.50 %\nTotal Risk-Based Capital $ 40,237 18.40 % $ 17,493 8.00 % $ 21,867 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 37,975 17.37 % $ 13,120 6.00 % $ 17,493 8.00 %\nTier 1 Leverage $ 37,975 10.76 % $ 14,113 4.00 % $ 17,641 5.00 %\nT o Be Well Ca pitalized\nTo Be Considered Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Adequately Capitalized Action Provisions\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2022\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 37,963 16.45 % $ 10,383 4.50 % $ 14,998 6.50 %\nTotal Risk-Based Capital $ 39,866 17.28 % $ 18,459 8.00 % $ 23,074 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 37,963 16.45 % $ 13,845 6.00 % $ 18,459 8.00 %\nTier 1 Leverage $ 37,963 9.53 % $ 15,938 4.00 % $ 19,922 5.00 %\nFederal bank regulatory agencies are required to take certain supervisory actions against an undercapitalized\nbank, the severity of which depends upon the bank’s degree of capitalization. Failure to maintain an appropriate level\nof capital could cause the regulator to take any one or more of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including\nthe issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nLIQUIDITY\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies,\nwhich arise during the normal course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit\nwithdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers, as well as to meet current and planned expenditures.\nManagement monitors the liquidity position daily.\nOur liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and\ninvestment securities, funds provided by operations and capital. Additionally, liquidity is provided through our\nportfolios of cash and interest-bearing deposits in other banks, federal funds sold and securities available for sale.\nWhile scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan\n34\nprepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by the Bank’s\ncompetitors.\nThe borrowing requirements of customers include commitments to extend credit and the unused portion of lines\nof credit, which totaled $33.2 million at December 31, 2023. Management notes that, historically, a small percentage\nof unused lines of credit are actually drawn down by customers within a 12-month period.\nOur most liquid assets are cash and assets that can be readily converted into cash, including interest-bearing\ndeposits with banks and federal funds sold, and investment securities. At December 31, 2023, we had $1.9 million in\ncash and due from banks, $13.3 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold, and $139.4\nmillion in investment securities available for sale.\nThe Bank also has external sources of funds through the FHLB, Federal Reserve Discount Window and newly\nformed Bank Term Funding Program which can be drawn upon when required. The Bank has a line of credit totaling\napproximately $88.8 million with the FHLB of which $68.8 million was available to be drawn on December 31, 2023,\nsubject to qualifying loans and securities pledged as collateral. The lines of credit with the Federal Reserve are limited\nto the amount of qualifying collateral pledged.\nAdditionally, the Bank has unsecured federal funds lines of credit totaling $17.0 million with two institutions.\nThe proceeds of the Company’s line of credit may be used for general corporate purposes.\nTo further aid in managing liquidity, the Bank’s Board of Directors has approved and formed an Asset/Liability\nManagement Committee (“ALCO”) and Investment Committee to review and discuss recommendations for the use of\navailable cash and to maintain an investment portfolio. By limiting the maturity of securities and maintaining a\nconservative investment posture, management can rely on the investment portfolio to help meet any short-term funding\nneeds.\nWe believe the Bank has adequate cash on hand and available through liquidation of investment securities and\navailable borrowing capacity to meet our liquidity needs. Although we believe sufficient liquidity exists, if economic\nconditions and consumer confidence deteriorate, this liquidity could be depleted, which would then materially affect our\nability to meet operating needs and to raise additional capital.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which\ninvolve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLoan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of\nany conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed\nexpiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the\nloan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total\ncommitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by\nthe Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include\ndeposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable,\ninventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under\ndevelopment. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to\na third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and\nsimilar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in\n35\nextending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those\ncommitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.\nThe Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of\nthe commitment.\nCurrently, we break-out our unfunded commitments into the following categories:\n• Unfunded Construction Commitments\n• Unfunded Commercial Lines of Credit and Other\n• Unfunded Home Equity LOC\n• Unfunded Demand Deposit Overdraft LOC\n• Committed Loans Which Have Not Closed\n• Letters of Credit\nLoan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including collateral, as\noutstanding loans. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank has accrued $473,000 as a reserve for credit losses on unfunded\ncommitments, a decrease of $4,000 from the $477,000 accrued as of December 31, 2022. Unfunded commitments\nrelated to these financial instruments with off balance sheet risk, are included in “other liabilities”. The additional\nprovision amount is included in ‘other expense’.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nOur primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation. Interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional\nbanking activities in which the Bank engages, such as gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including\neconomic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between\nthe interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on liabilities. Our interest rate risk represents the level of\nexposure we have to fluctuations in interest rates and is primarily measured as the change in earnings and the theoretical\nmarket value of equity that results from changes in interest rates. The Investment Committee oversees our management\nof interest rate risk. The objective of the management of interest rate risk is to maximize stockholder value, enhance\nprofitability and increase capital, serve customer and community needs, and protect us from any material financial\nconsequences associated with changes in interest rate risk.\nInterest rate risk is that risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates. It arises from\ndifferences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (repricing risk); from changing rate\nrelationships across yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the\nspectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest rate related options embedded in certain bank products\n(option risk). Changes in interest rates may also affect a bank’s underlying economic value. The value of a bank’s\nassets, liabilities, and interest-rate related, off-balance sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present\nvalue of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is changed.\nWe believe that accepting some level of interest rate risk is necessary in order to achieve realistic profit goals.\nManagement and the Board have chosen an interest rate risk profile that is consistent with our strategic business plan.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy,\nwhich is administered by the Investment Committee. The policy establishes limits on risk, which are quantitative\nmeasures of the percentage change in net interest income (a measure of net interest income at risk) and the fair value of\nequity capital (a measure of economic value of equity or “EVE” at risk) resulting from a hypothetical change in U.S.\nTreasury interest rates. We measure the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on our short-\nterm earnings, long-term value, and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling.\nThe simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors embedded in\n36\ninvestment and loan portfolio contracts. As with any method of gauging interest rate risk, there are certain\nshortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology we employ. When interest rates change, actual\nmovements in different categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and\nwithdrawals of time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. Finally, the\nmethodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable-rate loan customers’ ability\nto service their debts, or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan and deposit products.\nWe prepare a current base case and up to eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter and report the\nanalysis to the Board of Directors. In addition, more frequent forecasts may be produced when interest rates are\nparticularly uncertain or when other business conditions or strategy analysis so dictate.\nThe statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for up to eight alternative interest rate shock\npossibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk. Average interest rates are shocked by +/ - 100, 200, 300, and 400\nbasis points (“bp”), although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in the current\nrate environment. It is our goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest-earnings at risk over a twelve-month\nperiod and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels.\nAt December 31, 2023, we were in an asset sensitive position. Management continuously strives to reduce\nhigher costing fixed rate funding instruments, while increasing assets that are more fluid in their repricing. An asset\nsensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a rising rate environment since more assets than liabilities will reprice in\na given time frame as interest rates rise. Similarly, a liability sensitive position, theoretically, is favorable in a declining\ninterest rate environment since more liabilities than assets will reprice in a given time frame as interest rates decline.\nManagement works to maintain a consistent spread between yields on assets and costs of deposits and borrowings,\nregardless of the direction of interest rates.\nS tatic Ba lance Shee t/Im me diate Cha nge in R ates\nEstimated Changes in Net Interest Income -200 bp -100 bp +100 bp +200 bp\n` ` ` `\nPolicy Limit -15% -10 % -10 % -15 %\nDecember 31, 2023 -5% -2 % -1 % -2 %\nDecember 31, 2022 -12% -6 % 1 % 3 %\nAs shown above, over a 12-month modeling period, measures of net interest income at risk in the down\nscenarios were more favorable while net interest at risk in the up scenarios were slightly less favorable at December 31,\n2023 than at December 31, 2022. All measures remained within prescribed policy limits.\nFalling Rates: If market rates decline in a parallel fashion (i.e. down 100 or 200 bp over 12 months), projected\nNII levels quickly fall beneath the base rates scenario and present potential exposure to NII over the life of the\nsimulation as the asset base is assumed to be recycled into lower rates while the low cost nature of the current funding\nbase severely limits the amount of relief it can provide to asset yield pressures.\nRising Rates: Over the first 12 months in our rising rate scenarios, projected NII shows a slight decrease in\nprojected net interest income at December 31, 2023 compared to a projected slight increase at December 31, 2022. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, NII trends upward over the following months as more assets reprice more\nquickly than our interest-bearing deposits.\nThe measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the\neffects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company’s cash flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the\n37\npresent value of assets and liabilities. The difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the\neconomic value of equity, which, in theory, approximates the fair value of the Company’s net assets.\nS tatic Ba lance Shee t/Im me diate Cha nge in R ates\nEstimated Changes in Economic Value of Equity (EVE) -200 bp -100 bp +100 bp +200 bp\n` ` ` `\nPolicy Limit -20% -10 % -10 % -20 %\nDecember 31, 2023 11 % 6 % -10 % -19 %\nDecember 31, 2022 4 % 3 % -6 % -12 %\nThe EVE at risk declines at December 31, 2023 when compared to December 31, 2022 in the up interest rate\nshock levels but increases in the down interest rate shock levels. In a rising interest rate environment, the Company is\npositioned to generate less economic value of equity as asset values fall faster than funding sources because the liabilities\nreprice much slower than our assets, especially considering our interest earning assets are much greater than our interest-\nbearing liabilities. The Company’s economic value of equity improves in declining interest rate environments as the\nmajority of our liabilities cannot continue to decrease much from their current low levels thus the economic value of\nliabilities and assets both worsen.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in\nterms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to\ninflation. Unlike most industrial companies, nearly all of the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.\nAs a result, interest rates have a greater impact on the Company’s performance than do the effects of general levels of\ninflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and\nservices.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (GAAP) and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. All intercompany\ntransactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order to conform\nthe previous year’s financial statements to the current year’s presentation. Application of these principles requires\nmanagement to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and\naccompanying notes. These estimates or judgments reflect management’s view of the most appropriate manner in\nwhich to record and report our overall financial performance. Because these estimates or judgments are based on\ncurrent circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate based on actual experience. As such,\nchanges in these estimates, judgments, and/or assumptions may have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nAll accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data, Note 1, should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how our financial performance is\nrecorded and reported.\nWe have identified the following three policies as being critical because they require management to make\nparticularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex estimates or judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and\nbecause of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using\ndifferent assumptions. These policies relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses - loans, fair value\nmeasurements and the accounting for income taxes. Management believes it has used the best information available to\nmake the estimations or judgments necessary to value the related assets and liabilities. Actual performance that differs\nfrom estimates or judgments and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net\nincome. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. Following is a discussion of the areas we view as our most critical accounting policies, including the\nidentification of the variables most important in the estimation process.\n38\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for the expected credit losses of the loan\nportfolio as well as unfunded loan commitments. The amount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by\nmanagement. The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure\n(or pool of exposures) and replaces the incurred loss methodology’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit\nloss until it was probable a loss event was incurred. The Company also considers qualitative adjustments to the\nhistorical loss rate for each loan portfolio class. The qualitative adjustments for each loan class consider the conditions\nover the 20-year look-back period from which historical loss experience was based and are split into two components:\n1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality,\nremaining payments, volume and nature, credit culture and management, business environment or other management\nfactors; and 2) reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions and collateral values. Our\naccounting policy related to the reserve is disclosed in Note 1 under the heading “Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans.”\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures.\nAvailable for sale securities and interest rate swap agreements are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a\nnonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of, or specific reserves\nagainst, individual assets. GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the\nvaluation methodology used in the measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-\ndriven or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates\nabout market data.\nThe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is\ndependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market data. For financial instruments that trade\nactively and have quoted market prices or observable market data, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring\nfair value. When observable market prices and data are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to\nestimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or\nobservable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could\nresult in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use\nvaluation techniques that require more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Fair\nvalue is discussed further in Note 1 under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” and in Note 15, “Fair Value of\nFinancial Instruments”.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of\nexisting assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates in effect when these\ndifferences reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is\nmore likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We exercise significant\njudgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities. The\njudgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws.\nIf actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax\nrecognized, there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods. Realization of\ndeferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the future.\n39\nOther significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements that appear\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10K. We have not substantively changed any aspect of our overall approach\nin the application of the foregoing policies.\nITEM 7A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that is designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that information, which is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under\nthe Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and\nforms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely\nmanner. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have evaluated this\nsystem of disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, and have\nconcluded that the system is effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management, including its CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external\nreporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in\nreasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement (with the participation of the Company’s CEO and CFO) conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on\nthis evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\n40\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter\nof 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in\nthe two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating these critical\naudit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nF - 3\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s loan portfolio totaled $176.3\nmillion and has recorded an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) in the amount of $2.2 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company estimates the allowance for credit losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on\nindividually evaluated loans, as well as the estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio. The\ndetermination of the ACL requires management to exercise significant judgment and consider numerous subjective\nfactors, including determining qualitative factors utilized to adjust historical loss rates, risk grading loans, identifying\nloan impairments, among others. Different assumptions and conditions could result in a materially different amount for\nthe ACL.\nWe identified the valuation of the ACL as a critical audit matter. Auditing the ACL involves a high degree of\nsubjectivity in evaluating management's estimates, such as evaluating management’s assessment of economic conditions\nand other environmental factors used to adjust historical loss rates, evaluating the adequacy of specific allowances\nassociated with impaired loans and assessing the appropriateness of loan grades.\nOur audit procedures related to the estimated ACL included the following procedures, among others.\n• Evaluating the design effectiveness of controls over the Company's ACL including data completeness and\naccuracy, classifications of loans by loan segment, historical loss data, the establishment of qualitative and\nforecast adjustments, the calculation of a loss rate, grading and risk classification of loans and establishment of\nreserves on individually evaluated loans and management's review controls over the ACL balance as a whole;\n• Testing of completeness and accuracy of the information utilized in the calculation of the ACL;\n• Testing the computational accuracy of the calculations utilized in the ACL model;\n• Evaluating the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the\nadjustments and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used;\n• Testing the internal loan review functions and evaluating the assigned loan grades for appropriateness and\nreasonableness;\n• Assessing the reasonableness of specific reserves on individually assessed impaired loans;\n• Evaluating the overall reasonableness of qualitative factor and forecast adjustments, including assessing the\nbasis and reasonableness for the adjustments;\n• Reviewing subsequent events and considering whether they support or contradict the Company’s ACL estimate;\n• Evaluating overall reasonableness of estimated reserve by considering and comparing past performance of the\nCompany’s loan portfolio, and trends in credit quality of the loan portfolio.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021 .\n/s/ UHY LLP\nSalisbury, Maryland\nMarch 22, 2024\nF -

9\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Business\nGlen Burnie Bancorp (the “Company”) is a bank holding company organized in 1990 under the laws of the\nState of Maryland. The Company owns all outstanding shares of capital stock of The Bank of Glen Burnie (the\n“Bank”), a commercial bank organized in 1949 under the laws of the State of Maryland (the “State”). The Bank\nprovides financial services to individuals and corporate customers located in Anne Arundel County and surrounding\nareas of Central Maryland, and is subject to competition from other financial institutions. The Bank is also subject to\nthe regulations of certain Federal and State agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory\nauthorities. The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Bank conform, in all material respects, to accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and to general practices within the banking industry.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Glen Burnie Bancorp, The Bank of Glen Burnie\nand GBB Properties, Inc., a company engaged in the acquisition and disposition of other real estate. All significant\nintercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary in order\nto conform the previous year’s financial statements to the current year’s presentation. In preparing the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and\nrelated disclosures. These estimates that require application of management's subjective or complex judgments often\nresult in the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future\nperiods. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including the valuation of certain loans held for\ninvestment (Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses); allowance for credit losses (Note 4, Loans and Allowance\nfor Credit Losses); valuation of investment securities (Note 3, Investment Securities); the fair value of financial\ninstruments (Note 16, Fair Value of Financial Instruments); benefit plan obligations and expenses (Note 10, Pension\nand Profit Sharing Plans); and the valuation of deferred tax assets (Note 9, Income Taxes). Certain amounts in the\nfinancial statements from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current financial statement presentation.\nThe Parent Only financial statements (see Note 18, Parent Company Financial Information) of the Company account for\nthe subsidiary using the equity method of accounting.\nInvestment Securities\nWe classify investment securities as trading, held to maturity (\"HTM\"), or available for sale (\"AFS\") at the date\nof acquisition. Purchases and sales of securities are generally recorded on a trade-date basis.\nInvestment securities that we might not hold until maturity are classified as AFS and are reported at fair value\nin the statement of financial condition. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices in active markets,\nif available. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is measured using pricing models or other\nmodel-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, which consider prepayment\nassumptions and other factors such as credit losses and market liquidity. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from\nearnings and reported, net of tax, in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Purchase premiums and discounts are\nrecognized in interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the securities. Purchase premiums or\ndiscounts related to mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted using projected prepayment speeds. Gains\nand losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification\nmethod.\nDebt securities are classified as HTM if the Company has both the intent and ability to hold those securities to\nmaturity regardless of changes in market conditions, liquidity needs or changes in general economic conditions. These\nsecurities are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts.\nF - 10\nTransfers of securities from available for sale to held to maturity are accounted for at fair value as of the date of\nthe transfer. The difference between the fair value and the par value at the date of transfer is considered a premium or\ndiscount and is accounted for accordingly. Any unrealized gain or loss at the date of the transfer is reported in OCI,\nand is amortized over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the\namortization of any premium or discount, and will offset or mitigate the effect on interest income of the amortization of\nthe premium or discount for that held to maturity security.\nImpairment may result from credit deterioration of the issuer or collateral underlying the security. In\nperforming an assessment of recoverability, all relevant information is considered, including the length of time and\nextent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the cause of the price decline, credit performance\nof the issuer and underlying collateral, and recoveries or further declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet\ndate.\nAFS debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. Although ASC 326 replaced the\nlegacy other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model with a credit loss model, it retained the fundamental nature of\nthe legacy OTTI model. For AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it\nintends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized\ncost basis. If either criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income.\nFor AFS debt securities where neither of the criteria are met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value\nhas resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which\nfair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the credit rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse\nconditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists,\nthe present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss\nexists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited to the amount that the fair value is less\nthan the amortized cost basis. Any remaining discount that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Under the new guidance, an entity may no longer consider the\nlength of time fair value has been less than amortized cost. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a\nprovision for (or release of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the\ncollectability of an AFS security is considered below the amortized cost basis of the security. As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company determined that the unrealized loss positions in AFS securities were not the result of credit\nlosses, and therefore, an allowance for credit losses was not recorded.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock\nAs a borrower from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\"FHLB\"), the Bank is required to purchase an\namount of FHLB stock based on our outstanding borrowings with the FHLB. This stock is used as collateral to secure\nthe borrowings from the FHLB and is accounted for as a cost-method investment. FHLB stock is an equity interest that\ndoes not necessarily have a readily determinable fair value for purposes of the ASC Topic 320, Accounting for Certain\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities, because its ownership is restricted and lacks a market. FHLB stock can be\nsold back only at its par value of $100 per share and only to the FHLB or another member institution.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of cumulative charge-offs,\ninterest applied to principal (for loans accounted for using the cost recovery method), unamortized net deferred loan\norigination fees and costs and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. Interest on loans is accrued and\nrecognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. When a loan is designated as held for investment, the\nintent is to hold these loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off.\nFrom time to time, the Company will originate loans to facilitate the sale of other real estate owned (OREO).\nSuch loans are accounted for using the installment method and any gain on sale is deferred. The Bank financed no\nsales of OREO for 2023 or 2022.\nF - 11\nLoan Fees and Costs\nLoan origination fees, commitment fees, direct loan origination costs and purchase premiums and discounts on\nloans are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield, to be amortized to interest income over the contractual term\nof the loan.\nNonaccrual Loans\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status when the full and timely collection of principal and interest is doubtful,\ngenerally when the loan becomes 90 days or more past due for principal or interest payment or if part of the principal\nbalance has been charged off. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status all interest previously accrued but not\ncollected is reversed against current period interest income.\nAll payments received on nonaccrual loans are accounted for using the cost recovery method. Under the cost\nrecovery method, all cash collected is applied to first reduce the principal balance. A loan may be returned to accrual\nstatus if all delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and the collectability of the remaining\nprincipal and interest payments in accordance with the loan agreement is reasonably assured. Loans that are well-\nsecured and in the process of collection are maintained on accrual status, even if they are 90 days or more past due.\nImpaired Loans\nA loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all contractual principal and interest payments due will\nnot be collected in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining\nwhether a loan is impaired include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal\nand interest payments when due. The carrying value of impaired loans is based on the present value of the loan’s\nexpected future cash flows or, alternatively, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral.\nModifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nManagement evaluates loan restructurings according to the accounting guidance for loan modifications. We\nmay, for economic or legal reasons, grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that we would not\notherwise consider. Management strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and works with them to\nmodify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status. These modified terms may include rate\nreductions, principal forgiveness, payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to\navoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral. A restructuring that results in only an insignificant delay in payment\nis not considered a concession. A delay may be considered insignificant if the payments subject to the delay are\ninsignificant relative to the unpaid principal or collateral value and the contractual amount due, or the delay in timing of\nthe restructured payment period is insignificant relative to the frequency of payments, the debt's original contractual\nmaturity or original expected duration.\nLoan modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designated as impaired because interest\nand principal payments will not be received in accordance with the original contract terms. Loans that are performing\nand on accrual status as of the date of the modification remain on accrual status. Loans that are nonperforming as of\nthe date of modification generally remain as nonaccrual until the prospect of future payments in accordance with the\nmodified loan agreement is reasonably assured, generally demonstrated when the borrower maintains compliance with\nthe restructured terms for a predetermined period, normally at least six months. Loans with temporary below-market\nconcessions remain designated as a loan to borrower experiencing financial difficulty and impaired regardless of the\naccrual or performance status until the loan is paid off. However, if the loan has been modified in a subsequent\nrestructure with market terms and the borrower is not currently experiencing financial difficulty, then the loan may be\nde-designated as being made to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans Receivable\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company applied ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC\n326\"), such that the allowance calculation is based on the CECL methodology. Prior to January 1, 2021, the calculation\nF - 12\nwas based on incurred loss methodology. See Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses for details. The\nCompany maintains an allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) for the expected credit losses of the loan portfolio as well as\nunfunded loan commitments. The amount of ACL is based on ongoing, quarterly assessments by management. The\nCECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures)\nand replaces the incurred loss methodology’s threshold that delayed the recognition of a credit loss until it was probable\na loss event was incurred.\nThe ACL consists of the allowance for credit losses - loans and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The\nestimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts.\nHistorical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. We then consider\nwhether the historical loss experience should be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at\nthe reporting date that did not exist over the period that historical experience was based on for each loan type. Finally,\nwe consider forecasts about future economic conditions or changes in collateral values that are reasonable and\nsupportable.\nPortfolio segment is defined as the level at which the Company develops and documents a systematic\nmethodology to determine its ACL. The Company has designated three loan portfolio segments: loans secured by\nreal estate, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans. These loan portfolio segments are further\ndisaggregated into classes, which represent loans of similar type, risk characteristics, and methods for monitoring and\nassessing credit risk. The loans secured by real estate portfolio segment is disaggregated into five classes: construction\nand land, farmland, single-family residential, multi-family, and commercial. The commercial and industrial loan\nportfolio segment is disaggregated into two classes: commercial and industrial, and SBA guaranty. The risk of loss\nfor the commercial and industrial loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by the credit risk rating assigned to\neach borrower. Commercial and industrial loan risk ratings are determined by experienced senior credit officers based\non specific facts and circumstances and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit\nspecialists. The consumer loan portfolio segment is disaggregated into two classes: consumer and automobile. The\nrisk of loss for the consumer loan portfolio segment is generally most indicated by delinquency status and general\neconomic factors. Each of the three loan portfolio segments may also be further segmented based on risk\ncharacteristics.\nFor most of our loan portfolio classes, the historical loss experience is determined using the Average Charge-\nOff Method. This method pools loans into groups (“cohorts”) sharing similar risk characteristics and tracks each\ncohort’s net charge-offs over the lives of the loans. The Average Charge-Off Method uses historical values by period\n(20-year look-back) to calculate losses and then applies the historical average to future balances over the life of the\naccount. The historical loss rates for each cohort are then averaged to calculate an overall historical loss rate which is\napplied to the current loan balance to arrive at the quantitative baseline portion of the allowance for credit losses for the\nrespective loan portfolio class. For certain loan portfolio classes, the Company determined there was not sufficient\nhistorical loss information to calculate a meaningful historical loss rate using the average charge-off methodology. For\nany such loan portfolio class, peer group history contributes to the Company’s weighted average loss history. The peer\ngroup data is included in the weighted average loss history that is developed for each loan pool.\nThe Company also considers qualitative adjustments to the historical loss rate for each loan portfolio class.\nThe qualitative adjustments for each loan class consider the conditions over the 20-year look-back period from which\nhistorical loss experience was based and are split into two components: 1) asset or class specific risk characteristics or\ncurrent conditions at the reporting date related to portfolio credit quality, remaining payments, volume and nature, credit\nculture and management, business environment or other management factors; and 2) reasonable and supportable forecast\nof future economic conditions and collateral values.\nThe Company performs a quarterly asset quality review which includes a review of forecasted gross charge-offs\nand recoveries, nonperforming assets, criticized loans, risk rating migration, delinquencies, etc. The asset quality\nreview is performed by management and the results are used to consider a qualitative overlay to the quantitative\nbaseline.\nF - 13\nWhen management deems it to be appropriate, the Company establishes a specific reserve for individually\nevaluated loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the loans included in each respective loan pool. These\nindividually evaluated loans are removed from their respective pools and typically represent collateral dependent loans\nbut may also include other non-performing loans or loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nImpaired Loans\nThe specific credit allocations are based on regular analysis of all loans over a fixed-dollar amount where the\ninternal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification. When a loan is identified as impaired, impairment is\nmeasured based on net realizable value, and the recorded investment balance of the loan. For impaired loans, we\nrecognize impairment if we determine that the net realizable value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded\ninvestment of the loan (net of previous charge-offs and deferred loan fees and costs), except when the sole remaining\nsource of collection is the underlying collateral. In these cases, impairment is measured as the difference between the\nrecorded investment balance of the loan and the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is adjusted\nfor the estimated cost to sell if repayment or satisfaction of a loan is dependent on the sale (rather than only on the\noperation) of the collateral.\nOnce the impairment amount is determined, an asset-specific allowance is provided that is equal to the\ncalculated impairment and included in the allowance for credit losses - loans. If the calculated impairment is\ndetermined to be permanent or not recoverable, the impairment will be charged off. Factors considered by management\nin determining if impairment is permanent or not recoverable include whether management judges the loan to be\nuncollectible, repayment is deemed to be protracted beyond reasonable time frames or the loss becomes evident owing to\nthe borrower’s lack of assets.\nEstimate of Probable Credit Losses - Loans\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC\n326”) which replaces the “incurred loss approach” for estimating credit losses with an expected loss methodology. The\nincurred loss model delayed the recognition of credit losses until it was probable that a loss had occurred, while the\nCECL model requires the immediate recognition of expected credit losses over the contractual term for financial\ninstruments that fall within the scope of CECL at the date of origination or purchase of the financial instrument. The\nCECL model, which is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet credit exposures, affects the Company’s estimates of the allowance for credit losses for our loan\nportfolio and the reserve for our off-balance sheet credit exposures related to loan commitments. The allowance for\ncredit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the\nallowance for credit losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The\nallowance, based on all available information from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing the collectability\nof loans over their contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate, is an amount that\nmanagement believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible. The\nevaluations are performed for each class of loans and take into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and\nvolume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, value of collateral securing the\nloans and current economic conditions and trends that may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay. For example,\ndelinquencies in unsecured loans and indirect automobile installment loans will be reserved for at significantly higher\nratios than loans secured by real estate. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions or\nchanges in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable. Based on that analysis, the Bank deems its allowance\nfor credit losses in proportion to the total nonaccrual loans and past due loans to be sufficient.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Company maintains a separate allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments, which is included in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The reserve for unfunded\ncommitments (off-balance sheet financial instruments) is established through a provision for credit losses - unfunded\nF - 14\ncommitments, the changes of which are recorded in noninterest expense. The reserve for unfunded commitments is an\namount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing commitments,\nincluding unused portions of revolving lines of credit and other loans, standby letters of credit, and unused deposit\naccount overdraft privileges. The reserve for unfunded commitments is based on evaluations of the collectability, and\nprior loss experience of unfunded commitments. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the\nnature and size of the loan portfolio, overall loan portfolio quality, loan concentrations, specific problem loans and\nrelated unfunded commitments, and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower’s or depositor’s ability to\npay.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned (\"OREO\") represents real estate acquired in partial or total satisfaction of debts\npreviously contracted with the Company, generally through the foreclosure of loans. These properties are initially\nrecorded at the net realizable value (fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell). Upon transfer of a loan to\nOREO, an appraisal is obtained and any excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value is charged against the\nallowance for credit losses - loans. Subsequent declines in net realizable value identified from the ongoing analysis of\nsuch properties as well as gains and losses realized from the sale of OREO are recognized in current period earnings\nwithin noninterest expense as foreclosed property expense. The net realizable value of these assets is reviewed and\nupdated as circumstances warrant. Loans transferred to OREO through foreclosure proceedings totaled $0 for the year\nended December 31, 2022, and 2023.\nPremises and Equipment\nBank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated over the\nestimated useful life of the related asset or the term of the lease using the straight-line method. Expenditures for\nimprovements that extend the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the asset’s remaining useful life.\nGains or losses realized on the disposition of premises and equipment are reflected in the consolidated statements of\nincome. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to occupancy and equipment expense as incurred.\nComputer software is recorded at cost and amortized over three to five years. Management periodically evaluates the\ncarrying value of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles, including goodwill, furniture and equipment and\nleasehold improvements for impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense, and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of\nestimated current and future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the\nconsolidated income tax expense.\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their\nreported amounts in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred\ntax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes and are reflected as discrete tax items in the\nCompany’s tax provision.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it is believed that these assets will more likely than\nnot be realized. In making this determination, the Company considers all available evidence, including future reversals\nof existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial\noperations. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently\nmeasured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement\nwith a taxing authority.\nThe Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and separate company state tax returns.\nF - 15\nFor a more detailed description of income taxes see Note 8, Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nFor asset/liability management purposes, the Company periodically uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge\nvarious exposures or to modify interest rate characteristics of various balance sheet accounts. All interest rate swap\nagreements are recorded at fair value. The Company records cash flow hedges at the inception of the derivative\ncontract based on the Company’s intentions and belief as to its likelihood of effectiveness as a hedge. Cash flow\nhedges represent a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a\nrecognized asset or liability. For a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported in other\ncomprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same periods during which the hedged transaction affects\nearnings. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not highly effective in hedging the changes in fair value\nor expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reported currently in earnings, as noninterest income.\nNet cash settlements on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in interest income or interest\nexpense, based on the item being hedged. Net cash settlements on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\nare reported in noninterest income. Cash flows on hedges are classified in the cash flow statement the same as the cash\nflows of the items being hedged.\nThe Company formally documents the relationship between derivatives and hedged items, as well as the risk\nmanagement objective and the strategy for undertaking hedge transactions at the inception of the hedging relationship.\nThis documentation includes linking cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific\nfirm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and\non an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair\nvalues or cash flows of the hedged items. The Company discontinues hedge accounting when it determines that the\nderivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative is\nsettled or terminates, a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, a hedged firm commitment is no longer firm,\nor treatment of the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate or intended.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, subsequent changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded as\nnoninterest income. We recognized a $0.2 million gain on cancellation of interest rate swap contracts for the year\nended December 31, 2022. There were no cancellations of interest rate swap contracts during 2023. When a cash\nflow hedge is discontinued but the hedged cash flows or forecasted transactions are still expected to occur, gains or\nlosses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income are amortized into earnings over the same periods which\nthe hedged transactions will affect earnings.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe term \"fair value\" is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement assumes that\nthe transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the\nabsence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The Company’s approach is to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value\nmeasurements. The degree of management judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument or\nother asset is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market value inputs for internal\nvaluation models used for estimating fair value. For financial instruments that are actively traded in the marketplace or\nwhose values are based on readily available market data, little judgment is necessary when estimating the instrument’s\nfair value. When observable market prices and data are not readily available, significant management judgment often is\nnecessary to estimate fair value. In those cases, different assumptions could result in significant changes in valuation.\nSee Note 16, Fair Value Measurement.\nF - 16\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Bank has included cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, and\nfederal funds sold as cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of reporting cash flows. The carrying value of cash and\ncash equivalents approximates its fair value due to its short-term nature.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders\nby the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of common stock\nequivalents (for example, stock options computed using the treasury stock method).\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising costs, which we consider to be media and marketing materials, are expensed as incurred. We\nincurred $0.1 million in advertising expense during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nBank Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has purchased bank owned life insurance policies on certain current and former employees as a\nmeans to generate tax-exempt income which is used to offset a portion of current and future employee benefit costs.\nBank owned life insurance is recorded at the cash surrender value of the policies. Changes in the cash surrender value\nare included in noninterest income.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on AFS securities and derivative\ninstruments. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are excluded from net income, and are reflected as a direct charge\nor credit to shareholders’ equity. Comprehensive income (loss) and the related components are disclosed in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments\nASU No. 2022-01, “Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method.” The\nASU clarifies the guidance in ASC 815 on fair value hedge accounting of interest rate risk for portfolios of financial assets.\nThe ASU amends the guidance in ASU 2017-12 (released on August 28, 2017) that, among other things, established the\n“last-of-layer” method for making the fair value hedge accounting for these portfolios more accessible. The ASU renames\nthat method the “portfolio layer” method and addresses feedback from stakeholders regarding its application. The\nobjective of the ASU is to better align the Company’s financial reporting with the results of its risk management strategy,\nand to improve the hedge accounting model by simplifying it. The ASU is effective for the Company for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance\ndid not have a material impact upon the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nASU No. 2022-02, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures.” The ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") in ASC\n310-40, \"Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors\" for entities that have adopted the current expected\ncredit loss (\"CECL\") model introduced by ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. It also requires that public business entities disclose current-\nperiod gross charge-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of\nSubtopic 326-20, \"Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost\". The ASU is effective for the\nCompany for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with\nearly adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact upon the Company’s financial\nposition and results of operations.\nF - 17\nASU No. 2023-01. Leases (Topic 842), “Common Control Arrangements.” The ASU is an amendment to\nTopic 842. The amendments in this Update clarify the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common\ncontrol leases. This Update has been issued in order to address current diversity in practice associated with the accounting\nfor leasehold improvements associated with a lease between entities under common control. The amendments in this\nUpdate apply to all lessees that are a party to a lease between entities under common control in which there are leasehold\nimprovements. The amendments in this Update are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December\n15, 2023. The Company currently has no leases which are subject to this guidance and therefore the impact of adopting\nthe new guidance is not expected to have a material impact upon the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nASU No. 2023-02. Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), “Accounting for Investments\nin Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method.” The amendments in this Update permit reporting\nentities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax\ncredits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. The amendments in this\nUpdate are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 with early adoption permitted.\nThe Company currently has no investments which are subject to this guidance and therefore the impact of adopting the\nnew guidance is not expected to have a material impact upon the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nASU No. 2023-05. Business Combinations – “Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and\nInitial Measurement.” The amendments in this Update are effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a\nformation date on or after January 1, 2025. Additionally, a joint venture that was formed before January 1, 2025 may\nelect to apply the amendments retrospectively if it has sufficient information. Early adoption is permitted in any interim\nor annual period in which financial statements have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance), either\nprospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of adopting the new guidance on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nASU No. 2023-06. Disclosure Improvements – “Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s\nDisclosure Update and Simplification Initiative.” The amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify or\nimprove disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of Topics. Many of the amendments allow users to more\neasily compare entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to\nthe SEC’s requirements. Also, the amendments align the requirements in the Codification with the SEC’s regulations.\nThe effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The amendments in this Update\nshould be applied prospectively. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from\nRegulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the Codification\nand will not become effective for any entity.\nASU No. 2023-07. “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n(“ASU 2023-04”). This update requires public entities with reportable segments to provide additional and more\ndetailed disclosures. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company\nis not currently required to report segment information and, as such, does not expect the adoption to have an impact on\nits consolidated financial statements.\nASU No. 2023-08. “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for\nand disclosure of Crypto Assets (“ASU 2023-08”).” This update provides guidance for crypto assets to be carried at\nfair value and requires additional disclosures. This standard is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company\ndoes not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-08 to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company\ncurrently does not hold crypto assets or carry goodwill on its balance sheet.\nASU No. 2023-09. “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This update\nrequires more detailed disclosures of income taxes paid net of refunds received, income from continuing operations\nbefore income tax expense or benefit, and income tax expense from continuing operations. This standard is to be\napplied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted, and will be effective for the Company for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on\nthe Company’s financial position or results of operations.\nF - 18\nNote 2. Restrictions on Cash and Amounts Due from Banks\nOn March 26, 2020 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System set the reserve requirement ratios to\nzero percent and reserve requirements were no longer administered. On December 22, 2020 the zero percent reserve\nrequirement ratio was extended for three years. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the average reserve balances were $0.\nNote 3.

Trading securities are\nthose that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. The Company held no\ntrading securities at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022. Available-for-sale investment securities, comprised of\ndebt and mortgage-backed securities, are those that may be sold before maturity due to changes in the Company's\ninterest rate risk profile or funding needs, and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,\nreported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss. Held-to-maturity investment securities are those that\nmanagement has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. The Company\nheld no held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nRealized gains and losses are recorded in noninterest income and are determined on a trade date basis using the\nspecific identification method. Interest and dividends on investment securities are recognized in interest income on an\naccrual basis. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income using the interest method over\nthe expected lives of the individual securities.\nF - 19\nThe following tables show the fair value and gross unrealized losses associated with the investment portfolio,\naggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss\nposition as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAt Dece mb e r 31, 2023\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands) Value Loss Value Loss Value Loss\nCollateralized mortgage obligations $ 492 $ (1) $ 11,927 $ (2,308) $ 12,419 $ (2,309)\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 5 — 46,109 (5,816) 46,114 (5,816)\nMunicipal securities 2,978 (39) 28,667 (9,226) 31,645 (9,265)\nU.S. Government agency securities 220 (1) 37,474 (7,711) 37,694 (7,712)\nCorporate securities — — 1,284 (216) 1,284 (216)\nU.S. Treasury securities — — 6,944 (54) 6,944 (54)\n$ 3,695 $ (41) $ 132,405 $ (25,331) $ 136,100 $ (25,372)\nAt December 31, 2022\nLess than 12 months 12 months or more Total\nFair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized\n(dollars in thousands) Value Loss Value Loss Value Loss\nCollateralized mortgage obligations $ 8,315 $ (364) $ 6,127 $ (1,984) $ 14,442 $ (2,348)\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 20,029 (1,308) 31,865 (5,600) 51,894 (6,908)\nMunicipal securities 18,456 (5,438) 13,340 (5,358) 31,796 (10,796)\nU.S. Government agency securities 13,526 (474) 22,767 (8,417) 36,293 (8,891)\nCorporate securities — — 1,325 (175) 1,325 (175)\nU.S. Treasury securities 6,783 (210) — — 6,783 (210)\n$ 67,109 $ (7,794) $ 75,424 $ (21,534) $ 142,533 $ (29,328)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any securities that had impairment charges.\nThe Company's investment securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by U.S. Government\nagencies, U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, Corporate securities, state governments and local municipalities.\nThere were no private label mortgage-backed securities (\"MBS\") or collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMO\") held in\nthe investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nThe fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and\nliquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the available for sale portfolio are included in shareholders'\nequity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. An unrealized loss exists when\nthe current fair value of an individual security is less than the amortized cost basis.\nThe Company does not believe that the available-for-sale debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position\nhave any credit loss impairment upon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2021 or as of December 31, 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company did not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position.\nIt is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their\namortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies\nor U.S. government sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a\nlong history of zero credit loss. Municipal bonds are considered to have issuer(s) of high credit quality (rated A or\nhigher) and the decline in fair value is due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. Corporate securities\nare non-rated investments that are booked as a debt security where rating agencies do not provide a rating. The absence\nof a rating does not imply substandard quality. Non-rated corporate securities may be purchased from issuers operating\nF - 20\nin and around the Company’s operating footprint. The issuer(s) continues to make timely principal and interest\npayments on the bonds. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity.\nThe Company held fifty-seven U.S. Government agency, seventy-two collateralized mortgage obligations, one\ntreasury security and eighty-three agency mortgage-backed securities that were in an unrealized loss position at\nDecember 31, 2023. Principal and interest payments of the underlying collateral for each of these securities are backed\nby U.S. Government sponsored agencies and carry minimal credit risk. Management found no evidence of credit loss\nimpairment on any of these securities and believes the unrealized losses are due to fluctuations in fair values resulting\nfrom changes in market interest rates and are considered temporary as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company held one corporate security that was in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2023.\nManagement believes the unrealized losses were the result of movements in long-term interest rates and are not\nreflective of any credit deterioration.\nAll municipal securities held in the investment portfolio are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis for credit loss\nimpairment. Each bond carries an investment grade rating by either Moody's or Standard & Poor's. In addition, the\nCompany periodically conducts its own independent review on each issuer to ensure the financial stability of the\nmunicipal entity. The largest geographic concentration was in Maryland and consisted of either general obligation or\nrevenue bonds backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality. At December 31, 2023, the investment portfolio\nincluded thirty-one municipal securities that were in an unrealized loss position. Management believes the unrealized\nlosses were the result of movements in long-term interest rates and are not reflective of any credit deterioration.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, investment securities in the amount of approximately $13.2 million and $0,\nrespectively, were pledged as collateral under the Federal Reserve’s Bank Term Funding Program.\nUnrealized losses on securities in the investment portfolio amounted to $25.4 million with a total fair value of\n$136.1 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to unrealized losses of $29.3 million with a total fair value of $142.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2022. The Company believes the unrealized losses presented in the tables above are\ntemporary in nature and primarily related to market interest rates or limited trading activity in a particular type of\nsecurity rather than the underlying credit quality of the issuers. The Company does not believe that these losses are\nother than temporary and does not currently intend to sell or believe it will be required to sell securities in an unrealized\nloss position prior to maturity or recovery of the amortized cost bases.\nThe following table presents investment securities by stated maturity at December 31, 2023. Collateralized\nmortgage obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities have expected maturities that differ from contractual\nmaturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties and,\ntherefore, these securities are classified separately with no specific maturity date.\nAt Decem be r 31, 2023\nAmortized Fair\n(dollars in thousands) Cost Value\nDue within one year $ 20,998 $ 20,814\nDue over one to five years 5,080 4,584\nDue over five to ten years 14,665 12,621\nDue over ten years 56,152 41,633\nCollateralized mortgage obligations 15,962 13,661\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 51,930 46,114\nTotal securities available for sale $ 164,787 $ 139,427\nNo investment securities were sold in 2023 or 2022.\nF - 21\nNote 4.

Construction and land loans increased from $4.5 million on December\n31, 2022, to $4.6 million on December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.1 million, or 3.04%. Farmland loans were $0.3\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Single-family residential loans increased from $80.3 million on\nDecember 31, 2022, to $86.9 million on December 31, 2023, an increase of $6.6 million, or 8.27%. Multi-family\nresidential loans were $5.2 million on December 31, 2023, and $5.3 on December 31, 2022, a decrease of $0.1 million,\nor 2.62%. Commercial real estate loans decreased $3.7 million, or 8.66%, to $39.2 million at December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $42.9 million on December 31, 2022. Commercial and industrial loans increased by $1.9 million, or\n20.69%, to $10.9 million on December 31, 2023, compared to $9.0 million on December 31, 2022.

Consumer loans increased by $0.5 million, or 34.06% to $2.0 million on December 31, 2023,\ncompared to $1.5 million on December 31, 2022. Automobile loans decreased from $36.4 million on December 31,\n2022, to $21.3 million on December 31, 2023, a decrease of $15.1 million or 41.66%.\nThe Company currently manages its credit products and the respective exposure to credit losses by specific\nportfolio segments and classes, which are levels at which the Company develops and documents its systematic\nmethodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company believes each portfolio segment has unique\nrisk characteristics. The Company's loans held for investment is divided into three portfolio segments: loans secured\nby real estate, commercial and industrial loans, and consumer loans. Each of these segments is further divided into\nloan classes for purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses. The Bank has an automotive indirect lending\nprogram where loans, collateralized by vehicles, made by car dealers to consumers are acquired by the Bank. The\nBank’s indirect loan group included $21.3 million and $36.4 million of such loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nThe Bank makes loans to customers located primarily in Anne Arundel County and surrounding areas of\nCentral Maryland. Although the loan portfolio is diversified, its performance will be influenced by the economy of the\nregion.\nF - 22\nIncluded in loans are loans due from directors, executive officers and other related parties of $0.2 million and\n$0, at December 31, 2023 and December, and 2022, respectively. These loans are made on the same terms, including\ninterest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with unrelated borrowers. The Board\nof Directors approves loans to directors, executive officers and other related parties to confirm that collateral\nrequirements, terms and rates are comparable to other borrowers and are in compliance with underwriting policies. The\nfollowing presents the activity in amount due from directors and other related parties for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022.\nDecem be r 3 1,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of year $ — $ —\nAdditions 150 1,078\nRepayments — (1,078)\nBalance at end of year $ 150 $ —\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability\nof a borrower to meet his or her obligations and entails both general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending,\nand risks specific to individual borrowers. Credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits\nexposure to any single customer, industry, or collateral type. Residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines\ngenerally have the lowest credit loss experience. Loans secured by personal property, such as auto loans, generally\nexperience medium credit losses. Unsecured loan products, such as personal revolving credit, have the highest credit\nloss experience and for that reason, the Bank has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending.\nCredit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely\nduring economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Generally, improving\neconomic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers, enhancing their ability to\nmeet their particular debt service requirements. Improvements, if any, in operating cash flows can be offset by the\nimpact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times. Inconsistent economic conditions may\nhave an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial customers, reducing their ability to meet debt service\nobligations.\nOn January 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“ASC\n326”) which replaces the “incurred loss approach” for estimating credit losses with an expected loss methodology. The\nincurred loss model delayed the recognition of credit losses until it was probable that a loss had occurred, while the\nCECL model requires the immediate recognition of expected credit losses over the contractual term for financial\ninstruments that fall within the scope of CECL at the date of origination or purchase of the financial instrument. The\nCECL model, which is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet credit exposures, affects the Company’s estimates of the allowance for credit losses for our loan\nportfolio and the reserve for our off-balance sheet credit exposures related to loan commitments. The allowance for\ncredit losses - loans is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against\nthe allowance for credit losses - loans when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely.\nThe allowance, based on all available information from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing the\ncollectability of loans over their contractual terms, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate, is an amount\nthat management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible.\nThe evaluations are performed for each class of loans and take into consideration factors such as changes in the nature\nand volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, review of specific problem loans, value of collateral securing\nthe loans and current economic conditions and trends that may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay. For example,\ndelinquencies in unsecured loans and indirect automobile installment loans will be reserved for at significantly higher\nratios than loans secured by real estate. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions or\nchanges in collateral values that are reasonable and supportable. Based on that analysis, the Bank deems its allowance\nfor credit losses - loans in proportion to the total nonaccrual loans and past due loans to be sufficient.\nF - 23\nThe following table presents the total allowance by loan segment:\nLoans S ec ured By Re al Estate Commer cia l and Industria l Lo ans Consum er Loans\nDecember 31, 2023 Construction Single-family Commercial Commercial\n(dollars in thousands) and Land Farmland Residential Multi-family Commercial and Industrial SBA Guaranty SBA PPP Consumer A utomobile Total\nBalance, beginning of\nyear $ 44 $ 20 $ 1,230 $ 103 $ 221 $ 174 $ 22 $ — $ 23 $ 325 $ 2,162\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — — (79) (124) (203)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 1 101 102\nRelease for credit losses (13) (2) 60 (7) (31) 130 (1) — 85 (125) 96\nBalance, end of year $ 31 $ 18 $ 1,290 $ 96 $ 190 $ 304 $ 21 $ — $ 30 $ 177 $ 2,157\nIndividually evaluated\nfor impairment:\nBalance in allowance $ — $ — $ 21 $ — $ — $ 179 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 200\nRelated loan balance — — 30 — — 299 — — — — 329\nCollectively evaluated\nfor impairment:\nBalance in allowance $ 31 $ 18 $ 1,269 $ 96 $ 190 $ 125 $ 21 $ — $ 30 $ 177 $ 1,957\nRelated loan balance 4,636 325 86,857 5,165 39,217 10,551 5,924 — 2,039 21,264 175,978\nLoans S ec ured By Re al Estate Commer cia l and Industria l Lo ans Consum er Loans\nDecember 31, 2022 Construction Single-family Commercial Commercial\n(dollars in thousands) and Land Farmland Residential Multi-family Commercial and Industrial SBA Guaranty SBA PPP Consumer A utomobile Total\nBalance, beginning of\nyear $ 5 $ 11 $ 1,357 $ 105 $ 278 $ 115 $ 30 $ — $ 36 $ 533 $ 2,470\nCharge-offs — — — — — (200) (9) — (14) (169) (392)\nRecoveries — — — — — — — — 8 188 196\nRelease for credit losses 39 9 (127) (2) (57) 259 1 — (7) (227) (112)\nBalance, end of year $ 44 $ 20 $ 1,230 $ 103 $ 221 $ 174 $ 22 $ — $ 23 $ 325 $ 2,162\nIndividually evaluated\nfor impairment:\nBalance in allowance $ — $ — $ 20 $ — $ — $ 59 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 79\nRelated loan balance — — 34 — — 300 — — — — 334\nCollectively evaluated\nfor impairment:\nBalance in allowance $ 44 $ 20 $ 1,210 $ 103 $ 221 $ 115 $ 22 $ — $ 23 $ 325 $ 2,083\nRelated loan balance 4,499 333 80,217 5,304 42,936 8,690 6,158 — 1,521 36,448 186,106\nManagement believes the allowance for credit losses is at an appropriate level to absorb inherent probable\nlosses in the portfolio.\nDuring the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, loans to 12 borrowers and related entities totaling\napproximately $203,000 were determined to be uncollectible and were charged off.

Loans that are rated 1-4 are classified as “pass” credits. For the pass\nrated loans, management believes there is a low risk of loss related to these loans and as necessary, credit may be\nstrengthened through improved borrower performance and/or additional collateral. Loans rated a 5 (Special Mention)\nare pass credits, but are loans that have been identified that warrant additional attention and monitoring and represent\n“criticized” assets. Loans rated a 6 (Substandard) or higher are considered “criticized” loans and represent an increased\nlevel of credit risk. The use and application of these risk ratings by the Bank conform to the Bank's policy and\nregulatory definitions.\nThe Bank’s internal risk ratings are as follows:\n1 – 4 (Pass) - Pass credits are loans in grades “superior” through “acceptable”. These are at least considered to\nbe credits with acceptable risks and would be granted in the normal course of lending operations.\n5 (Special Mention) - Special mention credits have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close\nattention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the\ncredits or in the Bank’s credit position at some future date. If weaknesses cannot be identified, classifying as special\nmention is not appropriate. Special mention credits are not adversely classified and do not expose the Bank to\nsufficient risk to warrant an adverse classification. No apparent loss of principal or interest is expected.\n6 (Substandard) - Substandard credits are inadequately protected by the current worth and paying capacity of\nthe obligor or by the collateral pledged. Financial statements normally reveal some or all of the following: poor\ntrends, lack of earnings and cash flow, excessive debt, lack of liquidity, and the absence of creditor protection. Credits\nso classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are\ncharacterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n7 (Doubtful) - A doubtful credit has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard asset with the added\ncharacteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts,\nconditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of\ncertain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset,\nits classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors include\nproposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and\nrefinancing plans. Doubtful classification for an entire credit should be avoided when collection of a specific portion\nappears highly probable with the adequately secured portion graded Substandard.\nF - 25\nIn the normal course of loan portfolio management, loan originators are responsible for continuous assessment\nof credit risk arising from the individual borrowers within their portfolio and assigning appropriate risk ratings. Credit\nAdministration is responsible for ensuring the integrity and operation of the risk rating system and maintenance of the\nwatch list. The Bank contracts with an independent third-party loan review firm that reviews and validates the internal\ncredit risk program on an annual basis. Results of these reviews are presented to the Audit Committee for approval and\nthen to management for implementation.

Amortization of\nsoftware totaled $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOperating lease Right-of-Use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present\nvalue of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. ROU assets also include any\ninitial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives\nreceived. The Bank leases its Severna Park and Linthicum branches. Minimum lease obligations under the Severna\nPark branch are $25,000 per year through September 2024. Minimum lease obligations under the Linthicum branch are\n$158,000 per year through December 2024, adjusted annually on a pre-determined basis.

The Bank uses\nits incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease\nliabilities as the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Lease terms may include options to extend\nor terminate when the Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nFuture minimum payments of the Bank’s operating leases as of December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nYear ending December 31, Amount\n(dollars in thousands)\n2024 $ 193\n2025 11\n2026 9\n2027 6\n2028 —\nThereafter —\nTotal $ 219\nNote 6. Federal Home Loan Bank, Short- and Long-term Borrowings\nThe Bank owned 12,171 shares of common stock of the FHLB at December 31, 2023. The Bank is required to\nmaintain an investment of 0.07% of total assets with a dollar cap of $18.0 million, adjusted annually, plus 4.75% of total\nadvances, adjusted for advances and repayments. The credit available under this facility is determined at 25% of the\nBank’s total assets, or approximately $88.8 million at December 31, 2023. Short- and long-term advances totaled\n$20.0 million and $0, respectively, under this credit arrangement at December 31, 2023, and short- and long-term\nadvances were both $0 at December 31, 2022. This credit facility is secured by a floating lien on the Bank’s residential\nmortgage loan portfolio. Average short-term borrowings approximated $5.2 million and $10.4 million for 2023 and\n2022, respectively and the weighted average interest rate was 5.43% and 2.30%, respectively. Average long-term\nborrowings approximated $0 million and $6.2 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF - 33\nAt December 31, 2023 the Bank had available unsecured federal funds lines of credit from two financial\ninstitutions for $9.0 million and $8.0 million.\nDerivatives\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk.\nThese derivative contracts involve the receipt of floating rate interest from a counterparty in exchange for the Company\nmaking fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement, without the exchange of the underlying notional value.\nThese instruments are designated as cash flow hedges as the receipt of floating rate interest from the counterparty is used\nto manage interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of short-term FHLB advances. The change in the fair\nvalue of this hedging instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently\nreclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nFor derivative financial instruments accounted for as hedging instruments, we formally designate and\ndocument, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management\nobjective, and the manner in which the effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed. We formally assess both at\ninception and at each reporting period thereafter, whether the derivative financial instruments used in hedging\ntransactions are effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposures. Any ineffective\nportion of the changes in cash flow of the instruments is recognized immediately into earnings.\nASC 815-10, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”) requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments\nas assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 815, we designated our\ninterest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of certain active and forecasted variable rate FHLB advances. Changes in the\nfair value of the hedging instrument, except any ineffective portion, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) until earnings were impacted by the hedged instrument. No components of our hedging instruments were\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in hedging exposure to variability in cash flows.\nClassification of the gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income upon release from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) is the same as that of the underlying exposure. We discontinue the use of hedge\naccounting prospectively when (1) the derivative instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair value or\ncash flows of the underlying hedged item; (2) the derivative instrument expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; or (3)\ndesignating the derivative instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate. When we discontinue hedge accounting\nbecause it is no longer probable that an anticipated transaction will occur in the originally expected period, or within an\nadditional two-month period thereafter, changes to fair value that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) are recognized immediately in earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $0 outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash\nflow hedges. A $10.0 million interest rate swap that became effective in November 2017 was paid in full as of October\n31, 2022, and two $5.0 million interest rate swaps that became effective in July 2018 and August 2018 were terminated\nearly on October 31, 2022, with a gain of $206,000 recognized in noninterest income.\nThe cash flow hedges were determined to be fully effective during all periods presented. As such, no\nineffectiveness has been included in net income. Total interest expense recorded on these swap transactions in the\nconsolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $0 and $150,000,\nrespectively.\nF - 34\nNote 7.

Other Noninterest Expenses\nOther noninterest expenses include the following:\nYe ar Ended De ce mber 31,\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoan related expenses $ 164 $ 145\nOther ATM expenses 34 41\nDirectors and other fees 277 266\nPostage, delivery and courier expenses 83 81\nOffice supplies expenses 44 38\nCredit report fees 21 24\nDues and subscription fees 94 112\nExamination and assessment fees 47 51\nFederal Reserve and correspondent bank services 28 27\nLiability insurance 124 109\n(Release) provision for unfunded commitments (4) 107\nCard services 111 114\nNASDAQ registration 50 61\nInvestor services 23 41\nOther 107 86\nTotal Other Noninterest Expense $ 1,203 $ 1,303\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nFinancial instruments:\nThe Bank is a party to financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its\ncustomers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which\ninvolve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nF - 37\nOutstanding loan commitments, unused lines of credit and letters of credit are as follows:\nDece mb er 31,\n2023 2022\n(dollars in thousands)\nLoan commitments:\nOther mortgage loans $ 8,952 $ 9,280\nUnused lines of credit:\nHome-equity lines $ 10,817 $ 10,142\nCommercial lines 12,862 10,717\nUnsecured consumer lines 532 579\n$ 24,210 $ 21,438\nLetters of credit: $ 45 $ 45\nLoan commitments and lines of credit are agreements to lend to customers as long as there is no violation of\nany conditions of the contracts. Loan commitments generally have interest rates fixed at current market amounts, fixed\nexpiration dates, and may require payment of a fee. Lines of credit generally have variable interest rates. Many of the\nloan commitments and lines of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon; accordingly, the total\ncommitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral or other security obtained, if deemed necessary by\nthe Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but may include\ndeposits held in financial institutions, U.S. Treasury securities, other marketable securities, accounts receivable,\ninventory, property and equipment, personal residences, income-producing commercial properties, and land under\ndevelopment. Personal guarantees are also obtained to provide added security for certain commitments.\nLetters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to\na third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to guarantee the installation of real property improvements and\nsimilar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in\nextending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds collateral and obtains personal guarantees supporting those\ncommitments for which collateral or other securities is deemed necessary.\nThe Bank’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customer is the contractual amount of\nthe commitment. Loan commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit are made on the same terms, including\ncollateral, as outstanding loans. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank accrued $473,000 and\n$477,000, respectively, as a reserve for losses on unfunded commitments related to these financial instruments with off\nbalance sheet risk, which is included in other liabilities.\nNote 13. Stockholders’ Equity\nRestrictions on Dividends\nThe Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law\nconsiderations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. Banking regulations limit the\namount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the Bank’s regulatory agencies. Regulatory approval is\nrequired to pay dividends that exceed the Bank’s net profits for the current year plus its retained net profits for the\npreceding two years.\nRetained earnings from which dividends may not be paid without prior approval totaled approximately $21.2\nmillion at December 31, 2023 and $20.7 million at December 31, 2022 based on the earnings restrictions and minimum\ncapital ratio requirements noted below.\nF - 38\nThe payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to\nmaintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution\ngenerally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be\nundercapitalized. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the Federal Reserve may prohibit\nthe payment of any dividends by the subsidiary banks if the Federal Reserve determines such payment would constitute\nan unsafe or unsound practice.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a stock-based compensation plan, which is described below. There were no options issued\nor activity under this plan since August 2007.\nEmployees who have completed one year of service are eligible to participate in the employee stock purchase\nplan. The number of shares of common stock granted under options will bear a uniform relationship to compensation.\nThe plan allows employees to buy stock under options granted at 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of\ngrant. Options are vested when granted and will expire no later than 27 months from the grant date or upon termination\nof employment.\nAt December 31, 2023, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan totaled 25,739.\nThe Board of Directors may suspend or discontinue the plan at its discretion.\nDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company’s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan allows all participating stockholders the\nopportunity to receive additional shares of common stock in lieu of cash dividends at 95% of the fair market value on the\ndividend payment date.\nDuring 2023 and 2022, shares of common stock purchased under the plan totaled 17,581 and 11,166,\nrespectively. At December 31, 2023, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan totaled 185,950.\nThe Board of Directors may suspend or discontinue the plan at its discretion.\nStockholder Purchase Plan\nThe Company’s stockholder purchase plan allows participating stockholders the option to purchase newly\nissued shares of common stock. The Board of Directors shall determine the number of shares that may be purchased\npursuant to options. Options granted will expire no later than three months from the grant date. Each option will\nentitle the stockholder to purchase one share of common stock, and will be granted in proportion to stockholder share\nholdings. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, stockholders may be given the opportunity to purchase\nunsubscribed shares.\nThere was no activity under this plan since June 23, 2000.\nAt December 31, 2023, shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plan totaled 183,348.\nThe Board of Directors may suspend or discontinue the plan at its discretion.\nUnder all three plans, options granted, exercised, and expired, shares issued and reserved, and grant prices have\nbeen restated for the effects of any stock dividends or stock splits.\nF - 39\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Bank’s primary regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and is subject to\nregulation, supervision and regular examination by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the\n“Commissioner”) and the FDIC. The Company is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal\nReserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and the regulations of the\nFederal Reserve Board.\nOn January 1, 2015, the Bank became subject to the new Basel III Capital Rules with full compliance with all\nof the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nHowever, the new Basel III Capital Rules do not apply to the Company since it is a small bank holding company with\nless than $1.0 billion in total consolidated assets. In July 2013, the final rules were published establishing a new\ncomprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee’s\nDecember 2010 framework known as “Basel III” for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements\napplicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking\ninstitutions’ regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting\nthe denominator in banking institutions’ regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach with a\nmore risk-sensitive approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the\nDodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies’ rules.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional\ndiscretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial\nstatements. The Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets, liabilities,\nand certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting principles. The Bank’s capital amounts\nand classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and\nother factors.\nThe rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the\nminimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to\nrisk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer\nis also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer began its\nphase-in period beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each subsequent year by\nan additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is\ndesigned to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and, as detailed above, effectively increases the minimum\nrequired risk-weighted capital ratios. Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented\nunder the final rules.\nThe final rules also revise the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted\nassets. The Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios are calculated by dividing the respective capital\namounts by risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets are calculated based on regulatory requirements and include\ntotal assets, with certain exclusions, allocated by risk weight category, and certain off-balance-sheet items, among other\nthings. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted quarterly average total assets, which\nexclude goodwill and other intangible assets, among other things.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank was well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt\ncorrective action under the new Basel III Capital Rules. Management believes, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, that\nthe Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. The following table presents actual and\nrequired capital ratios as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 for the Bank under the Basel III Capital Rules. The minimum\nrequired capital amounts presented include the minimum required capital levels as of December 31, 2023 and December\n31, 2022 based on the phase-in provisions of the Basel III Capital Rules. Capital levels required to be considered well\ncapitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations, as amended to reflect the changes under the Basel III\nCapital Rules.\nF - 40\nThe Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking\nagencies. Management has determined that the Company’s risk-based capital ratios are not materiality different than\nthe Bank’s and are not reflected in the table below.\nT o Be Well Ca pitalized\nTo Be Considered Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Adequately Capitalized Action Provisions\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 37,975 17.37 % $ 9,840 4.50 % $ 14,213 6.50 %\nTotal Risk-Based Capital $ 40,237 18.40 % $ 17,493 8.00 % $ 21,867 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 37,975 17.37 % $ 13,120 6.00 % $ 17,493 8.00 %\nTier 1 Leverage $ 37,975 10.76 % $ 14,113 4.00 % $ 17,641 5.00 %\nT o Be Well Ca pitalized\nTo Be Considered Under Prompt Corrective\nActual Adequately Capitalized Action Provisions\n(dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2022\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital $ 37,963 16.45 % $ 10,383 4.50 % $ 14,998 6.50 %\nTotal Risk-Based Capital $ 39,866 17.28 % $ 18,459 8.00 % $ 23,074 10.00 %\nTier 1 Risk-Based Capital $ 37,963 16.45 % $ 13,845 6.00 % $ 18,459 8.00 %\nTier 1 Leverage $ 37,963 9.53 % $ 15,938 4.00 % $ 19,922 5.00 %\nNote 14.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nASC Topic 825, Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires the disclosure of the estimated\nfair values of financial instruments. Quoted market prices, where available, are shown as estimates of fair values.\nBecause no quoted market prices are available for a significant part of the Company’s financial instruments, the fair\nvalues of such instruments have been derived based on the amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated\ndiscount rates.\nPresent value techniques used in estimating the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments are\nsignificantly affected by the assumptions used. Fair values derived from using present value techniques are not\nsubstantiated by comparisons to independent markets, and in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement\nof the instruments.\nASC Topic 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure\nrequirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the\nCompany.\nF - 41\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value and the related carrying values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments as December 31, 2023 and 2022. Items that are not financial instruments are not included.\nDecembe r 31 , 2023 Decembe r 31 , 2022\n(dollars in thousands) Carrying Fair Carrying Fair\nAmount Value Amount Value\nFinancial assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 1,940 $ 1,940 $ 2,035 $ 2,035\nInterest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions 12,189 12,189 22,680 22,680\nFederal funds sold 1,112 1,112 5,377 5,377\nInvestment securities available for sale 139,427 139,427 144,133 144,133\nInvestments in restricted stock 1,217 1,217 221 221\nGround rents 130 130 131 131\nLoans, less allowance for credit losses 174,150 161,802 184,278 177,254\nAccrued interest receivable 1,192 1,192 1,159 1,159\nCash value of life insurance 8,657 8,657 8,493 8,493\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits 300,067 252,707 362,947 299,773\nShort-term borrowings 30,000 30,000 — —\nAccrued interest payable 366 366 9 9\nUnrecognized financial instruments:\nCommitments to extend credit 33,162 33,162 30,718 30,718\nStandby letters of credit 45 45 45 45\nThe following table presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the\nCompany’s financial instruments.\n(dollars in thousands)\nCarrying Fair\nDecember 31, 2023 Amount Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial instruments - Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,241 $ 15,241 $ 15,241 — $ —\nLoans receivable, net 174,150 161,802 — — 161,802\nCash value of life insurance 8,657 8,657 — 8,657 —\nFinancial instruments - Liabilities\nDeposits 300,067 252,707 33,118 219,589 —\nFor purposes of the disclosures of estimated fair value, the following assumptions were used.\nLoans. The estimated fair value for loans is determined by discounting future cash flows using current rates at\nwhich similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nInvestment securities. Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where\napplicable. When quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable\ninstruments.\nDeposits. The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand\ndeposits, savings, NOW accounts and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand at the\nreporting date (that is, their carrying amounts). The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the rates currently\noffered for deposits of similar maturities. The fair value estimates do not include the benefit that results from the low-\ncost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market.\nBorrowings. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for short-term borrowings. The fair\nvalue of long-term fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates\ncurrently offered for similar financial instruments over the same maturities.\nF - 42\nOther assets and liabilities. The estimated fair values for cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits\nin other financial institutions, Federal funds sold, accrued interest receivable and payable, and short-term borrowings are\nconsidered to approximate cost because of their short-term nature. Other assets and liabilities of the Bank that are not\ndefined as financial instruments are not included in the above disclosures, such as property and equipment. In addition,\nnon-financial instruments typically not recognized in the financial statements nevertheless may have value but are not\nincluded in the above disclosures. These include, among other items, the estimated earnings power of core deposit\naccounts, the trained work force, customer goodwill, and similar items.\nNote 16. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements which provides a framework for measuring\nand disclosing fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. ASC Topic 820 requires disclosures about the\nfair value of assets and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in periods subsequent to initial recognition, whether the\nmeasurements are made on a recurring basis or on a nonrecurring basis.\nASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction\nbetween market participants on the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which\nrequires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.\nThe Fair Value Hierarchy\nLevel 1 – Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nreporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt\nand equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations are obtained from readily available\npricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 – Valuation is based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 – Valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that\nare significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments\nwhose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as\ninstruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn determining the appropriate levels, the Company performs a detailed analysis of assets and liabilities that are\nsubject to ASC Topic 820. The Bank’s securities available for sale and interest rate swaps are the only assets or\nliabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis. The Bank may also be required, from time to time,\nto measure certain other financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis in\naccordance with GAAP.\nF - 43\nFair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nFair\n(dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value\nDecember 31, 2023\nRecurring:\nSecurities available for sale\nU.S. Treasury $ 6,945 $ — $ — $ 6,945\nState and Municipal — 33,729 — 33,729\nMortgaged-backed 531 96,938 — 97,469\nCorporate securities — 1,284 — 1,284\nNon-recurring:\nImpaired loans — — 398 398\n$ 7,476 $ 131,951 $ 398 $ 139,825\nDecember 31, 2022\nRecurring:\nSecurities available for sale\nU.S. Treasury\nState and Municipal — $ 6,783 $ — $ 6,783\nMortgaged-backed — 32,297 — 32,297\nCorporate securities — 103,728 — 103,728\nInterest rate swap — 1,325 — 1,325\nNon-recurring:\nImpaired loans — — 330 330\n$ — $ 144,133 $ 330 $ 144,463\nSecurities available for sale and interest rate swaps are based on quoted market prices, where available. If\nquoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.\nMeasured on a Non-Recurring Basis:\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities\nThe Bank is predominantly a cash flow lender with real estate serving as collateral on a majority of loans.\nLoans which are deemed to be impaired and foreclosed real estate assets are primarily valued on a nonrecurring basis at\nthe fair values of the underlying real estate collateral. The Bank determines such fair values from independent\nappraisals. Based on these appraisals, management has applied a specific valuation allowance allocation of $201,000\nand $80,000 in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to the impaired loans, which management considers to be level 3 inputs.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe obtain fair values for our impaired loans through a variety of data points and mostly rely on appraisals from\nindependent appraisers. These appraisals do not include an inside inspection of the property as our loan documents do\nnot require the borrower to allow access to the property. Therefore, the most significant unobservable inputs are the\ndetails of the amenities included within the property and the condition of the property. Further, we cannot always\naccurately assess the amount of time it takes to gain ownership of our collateral through the foreclosure process and the\ndamage, as well as potential looting, of the property further decreasing our value.\nWe typically get independent appraisals of properties within three months from the time we determine there\nmay be a collateral shortfall from an impaired loan. The appraisals are typically updated every 12 months from the\nindependent appraiser and more frequently if we feel material changes in value may have occurred for this specific\nproperty. During interim periods, typically at the end of each calendar quarter, we review other data points such as a\ncomparable from other like properties or changes in tax assessment values.\nF - 44\nNon-Financial Assets and Non-Financial Liabilities\nApplication of ASC Topic 820 to non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities became effective January 1,\n2009. The Corporation has no non-financial assets or non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. Certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities typically measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\ninclude foreclosed assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment), non-financial assets and non-financial\nliabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment test, and intangible assets and other non-\nfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment.\nForeclosed real estate, which are considered to be non-financial assets, have been valued using a market approach.\nThe values were determined using market prices of similar current real estate assets in the same geographical area, which\nthe Bank considers to be level 2 inputs.\nNote 17. Revenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”\n(Topic 606) and all subsequent ASUs that modified Topic 606. The implementation of the new standard did not have a\nmaterial impact on the measurement or recognition of revenue; as such, a cumulative effect adjustment to opening\nretained earnings was not deemed necessary. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are\npresented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with\nour historic accounting under Topic 605.\nTopic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including revenue from loans and\nsecurities. Topic 606 is applicable to noninterest revenue streams such as deposit related fees, interchange fees and\nmerchant income. However, the recognition of these revenue streams did not change significantly upon adoption of\nTopic 606. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is generated from contracts with customers. Noninterest\nrevenue streams in-scope of Topic 606 are discussed below.\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts. Service charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees\n(i.e., net fees earned on analyzed business and public checking accounts), monthly service fees, check orders, and other\ndeposit account related fees. The Company’s performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service\nfees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the period in which the service is provided.\nCheck orders and other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the\nCompany’s performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service\ncharges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or at the end of the month through a direct charge to\ncustomers’ accounts.\nOther Noninterest Income. Other noninterest income consists of: fees, exchange, other service charges,\nsafety deposit box rental fees, and other miscellaneous revenue streams. Fees and other service charges are primarily\ncomprised of debit income, ATM fees, merchant services income, and other service charges. Debit card income is\nprimarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Company’s debit cards are processed through card\npayment networks. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a\nnon-Company cardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income mainly represents fees charged to\nmerchants to process their debit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Other service charges\ninclude revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, and other services. The Company’s\nperformance obligation for fees, exchange, and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue\nrecognized, when the services are rendered or upon completion.
