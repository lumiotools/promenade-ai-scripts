Our performance in the China region was strong and we saw significant interest in the recently introduced Accuray Tomo® C System and growth in our service business. I could not be more excited about where we are, as the company executes our strategy to drive top line and adjusted EBITDA growth transforming our competitive position in the global radiotherapy market,\" said Suzanne Winter, Chief Executive Officer.\n\n**Fiscal First Quarter Results**\n\nTotal net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $101.5 million, compared to $103.9 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $48.4 million, compared to $53.4 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Service revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $53.2 million, compared to $50.5 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Total net revenue on a constant currency basis was $102.0 million.\n\nTotal gross profit in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $34.5 million, or 33.9 percent of total net revenue, compared to total gross profit of $39.5 million, or 38.0 percent of total net revenue, in the prior fiscal year first quarter.\n\nOperating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $36.6 million, compared to $37.3 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter.\n\nNet loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $4.0 million, or $0.04 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.0 million, or $0.03 per share, in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was $3.1 million, compared to $6.5 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter.\n\nGross product orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled $55.4 million compared to $63.7 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. The book to bill ratio was 1.1 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to a book to bill ratio of 1.2 in the same period in the prior fiscal year. Order backlog as of September 30, 2024 was $468.6 million, which is approximately 4 percent lower than at the end of the prior fiscal year first quarter.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term restricted cash were $59.7 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $9.4 million from June 30, 2024, primarily due to the build-up of inventory as we ramp up manufacturing for increased shipments in the coming quarters.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Guidance**\n\nAccuray's financial guidance is based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market, economic and geopolitical conditions, including any recovery in the U.S. radiotherapy market; supply chain disruption, and the factors set forth under \"Safe Harbor Statement\" below.\n\nThe Company is raising guidance for fiscal year 2025 as follows:\n\n  * Total revenue is expected in the range of $462 million to $472 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $28 million to $30 million.\n\n\n\nGuidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense, and provision for income taxes. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nAccuray will host a conference call beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as well as recent corporate developments. Conference call dial-in information is as follows:\n\n  * U.S. callers: (833) 316-0563\n  * International callers: (412) 317-5747\n\n\n\nIndividuals interested in listening to the live conference call via the Internet may do so by logging on to the Investor Relations section of Accuray's website, [www.accuray.com](http://www.accuray.com). There will be a slide presentation accompanying today's event which can also be accessed on the company's Investor Relations page at [www.accuray.com](http://www.accuray.com).\n\nIn addition, a taped replay of the conference call will be available beginning approximately one hour after the call's conclusion and will be available for seven days. The replay number is (877) 344-7529 (USA), or (412) 317-0088 (International), Conference ID: 2342044. An archived webcast will also be available on Accuray's website until Accuray announces its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nAccuray reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Accuray uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, and net revenue on a constant currency basis.\n\nAccuray has supplemented its GAAP net income (loss) with a non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and ERP and ERP related expenditures. (\"adjusted EBITDA\"). The calculation of adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain non-recurring, irregular and one-time items. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is provided in the schedules below.\n\nAccuray has also reported certain operating results on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes disclosure of non-GAAP constant currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company's results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. Accuray calculates the constant currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period using the same foreign translation rate used in the prior period being compared against rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the current period.\n\nThere are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**About Accuray**\n\nAccuray Incorporated (Nasdaq: ARAY) is committed to expanding the powerful potential of radiation therapy to improve as many lives as possible.
