Hata, M.B.A., an\nentrepreneur with over 20 years of experience building companies that have delivered innovative therapies to patients.\nScientific Advisory Board includes world-class scientists who are key opinion leaders in precision medicine oncology and synthetic lethality, including SAB Chair Frank\nMcCormick, Ph.D. (UCSF), and Bill Sellers, M.D. (Broad Institute, Novartis).\nPharma Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations with Pfizer1, Amgen1, Gilead1, Merck1, and GlaxoSmithKline2. The GSK strategic partnership validates IDEAYA’s\nSynthetic Lethality platform and enhances the companies’ collective leadership in Synthetic Lethality. IDEAYA and GSK are collaborating on two programs – Pol Theta\nand Werner Helicase.
