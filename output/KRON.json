(Nasdaq: KRON), a company developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and other diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today highlighted preclinical data from its p300 KAT inhibitor program for autoimmune indications at the American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting, ACR Convergence 2024. The oral presentation will take place on Monday, November 18, 2024, from 4:15 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST.\n\nKronos Bio has been exploring the utility of KB-7898, a p300 KAT inhibitor, for autoimmune indications given the role of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and p300 in B cells, T cells and other immune cells. The data demonstrates the ability of p300 KAT inhibition to modulate the activity and function of multiple pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that drive chronic inflammatory diseases.\n\nIn the presentation titled, \"p300 KAT Inhibition Selectively Targets Multiple Cell Types Involved in Chronic Inflammation and Downregulates Key Inflammatory Cytokines\", the presenter, Dr. Peter Rahl, Vice President, Discovery Biology at Kronos, will summarize the experiments that led to the following key findings:\n\n  * In _ex vivo_ primary cell models, the authors demonstrated that p300 KAT inhibition by KB-7898 modulated proinflammatory signaling and blunted the production of multiple clinically validated molecules that drive disease-related inflammation, including secreted IgG, IL-23, and IL-17A\n  * p300 KAT inhibition by KB-7898 led to dose-dependent reduction up to 50% of KLH-IgG production in the Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin booster\n  * In a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model, one of the most commonly used models for studying rheumatoid arthritis, p300 inhibition significantly decreased inflammation, as measured by joint swelling, clinical score and histopathology.\n\n\n\nThe presentation is now available under the Science & Pipeline section of the Kronos Bio website on November 14, 2024. The abstract can be found on the American College of Rheumatology’s [website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dgk-BlGXZ934Kv_vJe6fHEP_HGuXFvGb_ZGH3vyU-loYlUmpIhu1CF93k-kcB_wykNLWGP2sd5KfObbd4cXU5VFISuTzuq0SmlrdcB1iW1IDfzUwFazrcaZYaEwr-FHjhx19WeEbblHJZ8Qc3C0UtyiTYHdGmmONk0LZGplVeZ0lrfj8fJP0WBlYiqa7Y7vg0-JtPscFtpQfEnAODsfCaeMNTx_UN1ccfDBd6NIg0kMb96xMGvQxpvurXTpHJLwi0f59bBmJY1yE8LtrMjMNpw==).\n\nAs announced on November 13, 2024, Kronos Bio is exploring strategic alternatives for the Company and its remaining internally developed preclinical assets. One potential scenario could include partnering the two p300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) inhibitor programs: an oncology candidate, KB-9558, for multiple myeloma and HPV-driven cancers expected to be IND-ready by the end of 2024, and an autoimmune disease candidate, KB-7898, for Sjogren’s disease which has begun IND-enabling studies.\n\n**About Kronos Bio** Kronos Bio is a biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule therapeutics that address deregulated transcription, a hallmark of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

(Nasdaq: KRON), a company developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and autoimmune diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and provided a strategic update following a recent assessment of its ongoing Phase 1/2 expansion cohort of istisociclib in patients with platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Based on a review of emerging clinical data in the 80mg four-days-on, three-days-off expansion cohort, the Company and its Board of Directors has determined that the benefit-risk profile does not warrant further clinical evaluation of istisociclib. After an overall review of its business and given the clinical development timelines of its additional pipeline candidates, the Company will explore strategic alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. Kronos Bio will be implementing significant expense reduction strategies while it explores options for the Company and its remaining internally developed preclinical assets, one of which could include partnering the two p300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) inhibitor programs: an oncology candidate, KB-9558, for multiple myeloma and HPV-driven cancers expected to be IND-ready by the end of 2024, and an autoimmune disease candidate, KB-7898, for Sjögren’s disease which has begun IND-enabling studies.\n\n“While we believe istisociclib has provided benefit to a small number of patients in the Phase 1/2 trial, the emerging profile in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer suggests an unfavorable risk-benefit profile and does not warrant further clinical development,” said Norbert Bischofberger, Ph.D., chief executive officer. “We are very grateful to the patients, caregivers and medical staff who dedicated their time and energy to make this clinical trial possible and your commitment to evaluating novel approaches to treat cancer.”\n\nCharles Lin, Ph.D., Kronos’ chief scientific officer, added, “We continue to believe in the promise of our proprietary discovery technology’s application focused on targeting IRF4 where we have validated the critical role of this transcription factor in driving tumor cell growth in multiple myeloma and HPV-driven tumors or inflammation in autoimmune disease. Data from our early-stage p300 KAT inhibitor programs demonstrate that inhibition of key signaling pathways leads to restoration of tumor suppression activity in cancer cells or reduction of inflammation in autoimmune disease, underscoring the potential of this approach for patients that have limited or no targeted therapies.”\n\nThe decision to discontinue the development of istisociclib resulted from a recent safety assessment from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial patients with platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Out of seven enrolled patients, five exhibited neurological events as characterized by involuntary movements, confusion and hallucinations ranging from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Of those five patients, three discontinued due to adverse events, and two reduced the dose of istisociclib.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * **Cash, cash equivalents and investments** : Kronos Bio has $124.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024. \n  * **R &D expenses**: Research and development expenses were $12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, which includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million.\n  * **G &A expenses**: General and administrative expenses were $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, which includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million.\n  * **Net loss** : Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.1 million, or $0.23 per share, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.0 million.\n\n\n\n**_Process to Explore Strategic Alternatives_**\n\nKronos Bio has an exclusive engagement with a financial advisor to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives which may include, but is not limited to, an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sales of assets or other strategic transactions. There can be no assurance of a transaction, a successful outcome of these efforts, or the form or the timing of any such outcome. The Company does not intend to make any further disclosures that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or that, if executed, any agreement or transaction will be successfully consummated or on attractive terms. The Company does not intend to make any further disclosures regarding the strategic review process unless and until a specific course of action is approved by the Company's board of directors or until the Company determines that further disclosure is appropriate.\n\n**About Kronos Bio, Inc.**\n\nKronos Bio is a biopharmaceutical company developing small molecule therapeutics that address deregulated transcription, a hallmark of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

(Nasdaq: KRON), a company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and autoimmune diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today announced that it will present preclinical data from its p300 KAT inhibitor program for multiple myeloma at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting taking place in San Diego, California from December 7 to 10, 2024.\n\nKronos Bio is exploring the utility of its p300 KAT inhibitor, KB-9558, for multiple myeloma as well as HPV-driven tumors. In the presentation of preclinical data from the multiple myeloma program, the authors show that a context-specific and strong relationship exists between transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and p300, a protein that impacts genes that are linked to cancer cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, IRF4 and p300 display a preferential protein-protein interaction via a statistically similar network of interactors which was not evident with other transcription factors tested.\n\nAbstract details are as follows:\n\nTitle: Multi-Omic Transcription Regulatory Network Mapping Identifies Targetable Oncogenic TF-Cofactor Relationship between IRF4 and p300 in Multiple Myeloma, and Is Used to Improve TF Protein-ProteinInteraction MethodologyPresenters: W.

(Nasdaq: KRON), a company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and autoimmune diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today announced preclinical data from its p300 KAT inhibitor program for human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven tumors at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics.\n\nKronos Bio is exploring the utility of its p300 KAT inhibitor, KB-9558, for HPV-driven tumors. In the presentation, the authors show that the HPV genome preferentially integrates into transcriptionally active regions in the human genome where it becomes dependent on p300 to drive expression of its E6 and E7 oncogenes. It is widely recognized that elevated transcription of HPV E6 and E7 genes promotes degradation of tumor suppressors p53 and Rb. Importantly, inhibition of p300 KAT activity was highly selective in repressing the transcription of E6 and E7, which in turn led to restoration of the p53 and Rb pathways and drove anti-tumor effects through apoptosis and inhibition of uncontrolled tumor cell growth.\n\n\"Continued expression of certain viral genes, especially E6 and E7, plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression of HPV-driven tumors, including head & neck, cervical, and other anogenital cancers. Importantly, there are no approved targeted therapies that inhibit E6 and E7,” said Charles Lin, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Kronos Bio. \"While this is early-stage research, given the ability of p300 KAT inhibition to target E6 and E7 and restore tumor suppressor pathways, we believe this p300 KAT inhibitor has the potential to be a remarkable and unique approach toward ensuring that fewer people suffer from HPV-driven cancer.\"\n\nIn the presentation titled, \"Oncogenic human papillomavirus hijacks p300 to drive viral transcription, creating a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited with selective p300/CBP catalytic inhibitors\", the authors describe the experiments that led to the following key findings:\n\n  * HPV integrates into the human genome at specific locations where p300 regulates transcription\n  * p300 inhibition demonstrated specific and potent reduction of expression of HPV oncogenes E6 and E7, both at the RNA and protein level\n  * Loss of E6 and E7 led to restoration of p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways which led to the upregulation of p53 activated genes (e.g., CDKN1A) and downregulation of Rb repressed genes (e.g., CDK1)\n  * Re-expression of E6 and E7 from an exogenous lentiviral vector where viral oncogene transcription is not mediated by p300 KAT activity reversed the effects of p300 KAT inhibition on p53 restoration and anti-tumor effects\n  * These findings support the potential of KB-9558, a p300 KAT inhibitor, to treat HPV-driven tumors given its potential to suppress E6 and E7 expression and restore the p53 pathway\n\n\n\nThe poster presentation will take place on October 24, 2024, and is currently available under the [Publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=LoiDiz7x3L8EdSJVy9TtUBgxHjur03Mey-VbCyO3fiCqe_pVMbNxz43S9eeOrGUyLbOm5UA9Lq7BbuPabzMZmR2JFeqf5AikaQCCa2cQ49I=) section of the Kronos Bio website.\n\n**About Kronos Bio** Kronos Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address deregulated transcription, a hallmark of cancer and autoimmune disease.

(Nasdaq: KRON), a company dedicated to developing small molecule therapeutics that address cancers and autoimmune diseases driven by deregulated transcription, today announced that it will present preclinical data from its p300 KAT inhibitor program for human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven tumors at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, being held from October 23 to 25, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nKronos Bio is exploring the utility of its p300 KAT inhibitor, KB-9558, for HPV-driven tumors. In the presentation, the authors will show that the oncogenic HPV-16 virus hijacks the host transcriptional cofactor p300 in order to drive expression of the virally encoded oncogenes E6 and E7. Inhibition of p300 KAT activity achieved anti-tumor effects by downregulating E6 and E7 which in turn leads to reactivation of p53, a known tumor suppressor.\n\n“Despite the availability of HPV vaccines, HPV still causes many cancers including head and neck cancer and cervical cancer, with an estimated 38,000 new cases of HPV-driven cancers annually in the United States alone. Viral oncoproteins such as the ones encoded by HPV provide a unique therapeutic opportunity since they are only found in tumor cells,” said Charles Lin, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Kronos Bio. “By demonstrating that we can selectively inhibit E6 and E7 with a p300 KAT inhibitor, we hope to provide patients with HPV-driven cancers innovative targeted therapies.”\n\nAbstract details are as follows:\n\nTitle: Oncogenic human papillomavirus hijacks p300 to drive viral transcription, creating a therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited with selective p300/CBP catalytic inhibitorsPresenter: Marek Kobylarz, Ph.D., Senior ScientistPoster Session: Epigenetic modulators (HDAC Bromodomain modulators, EZH2)Date and Time: Thursday, October 24, 2024, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. CEST\n\nThe presentation will be available under the [Publications](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AdCCfGWdP8nj2tOO_4bnCz2gyHgR02E1wqrJIOrRS0k40IHeE3tqJ1ZohltTqcA7lAsL2ilW3_HG_eHEbyqE374WLgqtHv8JulQUo6Cp2p8=) section of the Kronos Bio website on October 24, 2024.
