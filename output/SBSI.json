(“Southside” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: SBSI) today reported its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Southside reported net income of $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.2%, compared to $18.4 million for the same period in 2023. Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.08, or 13.3%, to $0.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $0.60 for the same period in 2023. The annualized return on average shareholders’ equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 10.13%, compared to 9.50% for the same period in 2023. The annualized return on average assets was 0.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.93% for the same period in 2023. \n\n“Third quarter financial results were highlighted by a linked quarter $1.86 million increase in net interest income, a linked quarter eight basis point increase in our net interest margin to 2.95%, earnings per share of $0.68, a 13.69% return on average tangible equity(1), and continued strong asset quality,” stated Lee R. Gibson, Chief Executive Officer of Southside. “During the quarter we sold $28 million of lower yielding municipal securities, unwound the related fair value swaps and recorded a loss of $1.9 million. The proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding agency mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10 million of available for sale (“AFS”) municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1.” \n\nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n\nNet income was $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.2%. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.68 and $0.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in net interest income and the decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by the decrease in noninterest income and increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense. Annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders’ equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.98% and 10.13%, respectively, compared to 0.93% and 9.50%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio and tax-equivalent efficiency ratio(1) were 53.94% and 51.90%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.86% and 52.29%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 54.90% and 52.71%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. \n\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $55.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 4.1%, from the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was due to the increases in the average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Linked quarter, net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 3.5%, compared to $53.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to the increase in the average yield on our interest earning assets and the decrease in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by the decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets. \n\nOur net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) decreased to 2.82% and 2.95%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.85% and 3.02%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. Linked quarter, net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) increased from 2.74% and 2.87%, respectively for the three months ended June 30, 2024. \n\nNoninterest income was $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 24.6%, compared to $10.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to a net loss on sale of securities AFS and decreases in other noninterest income and deposit services income, partially offset by an increase in brokerage services income. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income decreased $3.4 million, or 29.3%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net loss on sale of securities AFS and decreases in other noninterest income and bank owned life insurance income related to a $1.0 million death benefit realized in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in other noninterest income for both periods was primarily due to an impairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10 million of AFS municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1. \n\nNoninterest expense increased $0.8 million, or 2.2%, to $36.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $35.6 million for the same period in 2023, due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and software and data processing expense, partially offset by decreases in advertising, travel and entertainment expense, professional fees, net occupancy expense and amortization of intangibles. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $0.6 million, or 1.6%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to increases in other noninterest expense, salaries and employee benefits expense and professional fees. \n\nIncome tax expense increased $1.3 million, or 40.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. On a linked quarter basis, income tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 15.8%. Our effective tax rate (“ETR”) increased to 17.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and increased slightly from 17.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The higher ETR for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income. \n\nOperating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 \n\nNet income was $66.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $69.4 million for the same period in 2023, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 3.8%. Earnings per diluted common share were $2.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.24 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.8%. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of the decrease in noninterest income and increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense, partially offset by the decrease in provision for credit losses and the increase in net interest income. Returns on average assets and average shareholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.06% and 11.19%, respectively, compared to 1.20% and 12.21%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio and tax-equivalent efficiency ratio(1) were 55.56% and 53.35%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53.99% and 51.44%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nNet interest income was $162.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $160.5 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 1.2%, due to increases in the average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. \n\nOur net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) were 2.76% and 2.90%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.95% and 3.13%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. \n\nNoninterest income was $29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 11.6%, compared to $33.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in the net gain on sale of equity securities, other noninterest income and deposit services income and a loss on sale of loans, partially offset by a decrease in net loss on sale of securities AFS and an increase in brokerage services income. The decrease in other noninterest income was primarily due to an impairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10 million of AFS municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1. \n\nNoninterest expense was $109.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $105.4 million for the same period in 2023, an increase of $3.6 million, or 3.4%. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and software and data processing expense, partially offset by decreases in professional fees, net occupancy expense, advertising, travel and entertainment expense, and amortization of intangibles. \n\nIncome tax expense increased $2.0 million, or 16.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Our ETR was approximately 17.6% and 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income. \n\nBalance Sheet Data \n\nAt September 30, 2024, Southside had $8.36 billion in total assets, compared to $8.28 billion at December 31, 2023 and $7.97 billion at September 30, 2023. \n\nLoans at September 30, 2024 were $4.58 billion, an increase of $157.4 million, or 3.6%, compared to $4.42 billion at September 30, 2023. Linked quarter, loans decreased $11.3 million, or 0.2%, due to decreases of $50.2 million in commercial real estate loans, $14.9 million in municipal loans, $2.4 million in loans to individuals and $1.0 million in commercial loans. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $39.8 million in construction loans and $17.4 million in 1-4 family residential loans. \n\nSecurities at September 30, 2024 were $2.70 billion, an increase of $53.4 million, or 2.0%, compared to $2.64 billion at September 30, 2023. Linked quarter, securities decreased $15.1 million, or 0.6%, from $2.71 billion at June 30, 2024. \n\nDeposits at September 30, 2024 were $6.44 billion, an increase of $86.1 million, or 1.4%, compared to $6.35 billion at September 30, 2023. Linked quarter, deposits decreased $60.2 million, or 0.9%, from $6.50 billion at June 30, 2024. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, we had 179,214 total deposit accounts with an average balance of $32,000. Our estimated uninsured deposits were 35.9% as of September 30, 2024. When excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits) and public fund deposits (all collateralized), our total estimated deposits without insurance or collateral was 19.2% as of September 30, 2024. Our noninterest bearing deposits represent approximately 21.4% of total deposits. Linked quarter, our cost of interest bearing deposits remained consistent at 3.01%. Linked quarter, our cost of total deposits decreased one basis point from 2.39% in the prior quarter to 2.38%. \n\nOur cost of interest bearing deposits increased 83 basis points, from 2.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cost of total deposits increased 75 basis points, from 1.62% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. \n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity \n\nOur capital ratios and contingent liquidity sources remain solid. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not purchase any common stock pursuant to our Stock Repurchase Plan. Under this plan, repurchases of our outstanding common stock may be carried out in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to any trading plan that might be adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company has no obligation to repurchase any shares under the Stock Repurchase Plan and may modify, suspend or discontinue the plan at any time. We have not purchased any common stock pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Plan subsequent to September 30, 2024. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total available contingent liquidity, net of current outstanding borrowings, was $2.23 billion, consisting of FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window and correspondent bank lines of credit. \n\nAsset Quality \n\nNonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were $7.7 million, or 0.09% of total assets, an increase of $3.3 million, or 74.8%, compared to $4.4 million, or 0.05% of total assets, at September 30, 2023. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets increased $0.7 million, or 10.7%, from $6.9 million at June 30, 2024 due primarily to an increase of $1.1 million, or 18.7%, in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by decreases of $0.1 million in restructured loans and $0.3 million in other real estate owned. \n\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $44.3 million, or 0.97% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $42.4 million, or 0.92% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of total assets was primarily due to the increased economic concerns forecasted in the CECL model specific to office and multifamily markets in metro areas. The allowance for loan losses was $41.8 million, or 0.94% of total loans, at September 30, 2023. \n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of $2.3 million, compared to a provision of $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a reversal of provision of $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net charge-offs were $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $0.9 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Net charge-offs were $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\nWe recorded a provision for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2024, respectively. We recorded a reversal of provision for credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit exposures of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures of $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The balance of the allowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures was $3.3 million and $3.9 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in other liabilities. \n\nDividend \n\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.36 per share on August 8, 2024, which was paid on September 5, 2024, to all shareholders of record as of August 22, 2024. \n\n_______________ \n\n(1) Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below and to “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” at the end of the financial statement tables in this Earnings Release for more information and for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest GAAP financial measure.\n\nConference Call \n\nSouthside's management team will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter ended September 30, 2024 financial results on Thursday, October 24, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. CDT.

However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the following fully taxable-equivalent measures (“FTE”): (i) Net interest income (FTE), (ii) net interest margin (FTE), (iii) net interest spread (FTE), and (iv) efficiency ratio (FTE), which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. \n\n_Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE)._ Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted under GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest margin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the average yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread. \n\n_Efficiency ratio (FTE)._ The efficiency ratio (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that provides a measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. The ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this ratio by dividing noninterest expense, excluding amortization expense on intangibles and certain nonrecurring expense by the sum of net interest income (FTE) and noninterest income, excluding net gain (loss) on sale of securities available for sale and certain nonrecurring impairments. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our efficiency ratio. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a non-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and such comparable GAAP measure. \n\nManagement believes adjusting net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable-equivalent basis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons. Tax-equivalent adjustments are reflected in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the “Average Balances with Average Yields and Rates” tables. \n\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the financial statement tables. \n\nAbout Southside Bancshares, Inc. \n\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company with approximately $8.36 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024, that owns 100% of Southside Bank.

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as representing management’s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “appear,” “believe,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,” “probability,” “risk,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “plans,” “potential,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are statements with respect to the Company’s beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions and future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, benefits of the Share Repurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, the Company's ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned operational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates and our expectations regarding rate increases, tax reform, inflation, the impacts related to or resulting from other economic factors are based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from those that have been estimated. The most significant factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, interest rate fluctuations and general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in financial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage liquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, labor shortages and changes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. \n\nAdditional information concerning the Company and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect the Company’s financial results, is included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under “Part I - Item 1. Forward Looking Information” and “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to update any factors or to announce publicly the result of revisions to any of the forward-looking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments. \n\n**Southside Bancshares, Inc.****Consolidated Financial Summary (Unaudited)****(Dollars in thousands)**  \n---  \n**As of**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Sep 30,**| **Jun 30,**| **Mar

Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.08, or 13.3%, to $0.68 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nfrom $0.60 for the same period in 2023. The annualized return on average shareholders’ equity for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, was 10.13%, compared to 9.50% for the same period in 2023. The annualized return on average assets\nwas 0.98% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.93% for the same period in 2023.\n“Third quarter financial results were highlighted by a linked quarter $1.86 million increase in net interest income, a linked\nquarter eight basis point increase in our net interest margin to 2.95%, earnings per share of $0.68, a 13.69% return on average\ntangible equity(1), and continued strong asset quality,” stated Lee R. Gibson, Chief Executive Officer of Southside. “During the\nquarter we sold $28 million of lower yielding municipal securities, unwound the related fair value swaps and recorded a loss of\n$1.9 million. The proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding agency mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we recorded an\nimpairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10 million of available for sale (“AFS”) municipal securities and\nthe unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1.”\nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNet income was $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $18.4 million for the same period\nin 2023, an increase of $2.1 million, or 11.2%. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.68 and $0.60 for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net income was a result of the increase in net interest\nincome and the decrease in provision for credit losses, partially offset by the decrease in noninterest income and increases in\nnoninterest expense and income tax expense. Annualized returns on average assets and average shareholders’ equity for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 were 0.98% and 10.13%, respectively, compared to 0.93% and 9.50%, respectively, for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio and tax-equivalent efficiency ratio(1) were 53.94%\nand 51.90%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.86% and 52.29%, respectively, for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, and 54.90% and 52.71%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $55.5 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 4.1%,\nfrom the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest income was due to the increases in the average balance and the\naverage yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities\nand average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Linked quarter, net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 3.5%,\ncompared to $53.6 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to the increase in the average yield on our\ninterest earning assets and the decrease in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by the decrease\nin the average balance of interest earning assets.\nOur net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) decreased to 2.82% and 2.95%, respectively, for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.85% and 3.02%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. Linked quarter,\nnet interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) increased from 2.74% and 2.87%, respectively for the three months\nended June 30, 2024.\nNoninterest income was $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 24.6%,\ncompared to $10.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to a net loss on sale of securities AFS and\ndecreases in other noninterest income and deposit services income, partially offset by an increase in brokerage services income.\nOn a linked quarter basis, noninterest income decreased $3.4 million, or 29.3%, compared to the three months ended June 30,\n2024. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in net loss on sale of securities AFS and decreases in other noninterest\nincome and bank owned life insurance income related to a $1.0 million death benefit realized in the second quarter of 2024.\nPage-1\nThe decrease in other noninterest income for both periods was primarily due to an impairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of\napproximately $10 million of AFS municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1.\nNoninterest expense increased $0.8 million, or 2.2%, to $36.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $35.6 million for the same period in 2023, due to increases in salaries and employee benefits and software and data\nprocessing expense, partially offset by decreases in advertising, travel and entertainment expense, professional fees, net\noccupancy expense and amortization of intangibles. On a linked quarter basis, noninterest expense increased by $0.6 million,\nor 1.6%, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024, due to increases in other noninterest expense, salaries and\nemployee benefits expense and professional fees.\nIncome tax expense increased $1.3 million, or 40.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. On a linked quarter basis, income tax expense decreased $0.8 million, or 15.8%. Our effective tax rate\n(“ETR”) increased to 17.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 14.5% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, and increased slightly from 17.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The higher ETR for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in tax-exempt\nincome as a percentage of pre-tax income.\nOperating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNet income was $66.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $69.4 million for the same period in\n2023, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 3.8%. Earnings per diluted common share were $2.20 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $2.24 for the same period in 2023, a decrease of 1.8%. The decrease in net income was\nprimarily a result of the decrease in noninterest income and increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense, partially\noffset by the decrease in provision for credit losses and the increase in net interest income. Returns on average assets and\naverage shareholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1.06% and 11.19%, respectively, compared to\n1.20% and 12.21%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio and tax-equivalent\nefficiency ratio(1) were 55.56% and 53.35%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53.99%\nand 51.44%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNet interest income was $162.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $160.5 million for the\nsame period in 2023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 1.2%, due to increases in the average balance and the average yield of\ninterest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and average\nbalance of our interest bearing liabilities.\nOur net interest margin and tax-equivalent net interest margin(1) were 2.76% and 2.90%, respectively, for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 2.95% and 3.13%, respectively, for the same period in 2023.\nNoninterest income was $29.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 11.6%,\ncompared to $33.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to decreases in the net gain on sale of equity\nsecurities, other noninterest income and deposit services income and a loss on sale of loans, partially offset by a decrease in net\nloss on sale of securities AFS and an increase in brokerage services income. The decrease in other noninterest income was\nprimarily due to an impairment charge of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10 million of AFS municipal securities and\nthe unwind of the related fair value swaps on October 1.\nNoninterest expense was $109.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $105.4 million for the\nsame period in 2023, an increase of $3.6 million, or 3.4%. The increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and\nemployee benefits and software and data processing expense, partially offset by decreases in professional fees, net occupancy\nexpense, advertising, travel and entertainment expense, and amortization of intangibles.\nIncome tax expense increased $2.0 million, or 16.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. Our ETR was approximately 17.6% and 15.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The higher ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was\nprimarily due to a decrease in tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income.\nBalance Sheet Data\nAt September 30, 2024, Southside had $8.36 billion in total assets, compared to $8.28 billion at December 31, 2023 and $7.97\nbillion at September 30, 2023.\nLoans at September 30, 2024 were $4.58 billion, an increase of $157.4 million, or 3.6%, compared to $4.42 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Linked quarter, loans decreased $11.3 million, or 0.2%, due to decreases of $50.2 million in commercial\nreal estate loans, $14.9 million in municipal loans, $2.4 million in loans to individuals and $1.0 million in commercial loans.\nThese decreases were partially offset by increases of $39.8 million in construction loans and $17.4 million in 1-4 family\nresidential loans.\nPage-2\nSecurities at September 30, 2024 were $2.70 billion, an increase of $53.4 million, or 2.0%, compared to $2.64 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Linked quarter, securities decreased $15.1 million, or 0.6%, from $2.71 billion at June 30, 2024.\nDeposits at September 30, 2024 were $6.44 billion, an increase of $86.1 million, or 1.4%, compared to $6.35 billion at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Linked quarter, deposits decreased $60.2 million, or 0.9%, from $6.50 billion at June 30, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had 179,214 total deposit accounts with an average balance of $32,000. Our estimated uninsured\ndeposits were 35.9% as of September 30, 2024. When excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits) and public fund\ndeposits (all collateralized), our total estimated deposits without insurance or collateral was 19.2% as of September 30, 2024.\nOur noninterest bearing deposits represent approximately 21.4% of total deposits. Linked quarter, our cost of interest bearing\ndeposits remained consistent at 3.01%. Linked quarter, our cost of total deposits decreased one basis point from 2.39% in the\nprior quarter to 2.38%.\nOur cost of interest bearing deposits increased 83 basis points, from 2.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to\n2.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cost of total deposits increased 75 basis points, from 1.62% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur capital ratios and contingent liquidity sources remain solid. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, we did not\npurchase any common stock pursuant to our Stock Repurchase Plan. Under this plan, repurchases of our outstanding common\nstock may be carried out in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or pursuant to any trading plan that might\nbe adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We have not purchased any common stock pursuant to the Stock Repurchase Plan subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total available contingent liquidity, net of current outstanding borrowings, was $2.23 billion,\nconsisting of FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window and correspondent bank lines of credit.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 were $7.7 million, or 0.09% of total assets, an increase of $3.3 million, or 74.8%,\ncompared to $4.4 million, or 0.05% of total assets, at September 30, 2023. Linked quarter, nonperforming assets increased $0.7\nmillion, or 10.7%, from $6.9 million at June 30, 2024 due primarily to an increase of $1.1 million, or 18.7%, in nonaccrual\nloans, partially offset by decreases of $0.1 million in restructured loans and $0.3 million in other real estate owned.\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $44.3 million, or 0.97% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $42.4 million,\nor 0.92% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. The increase in the allowance as a percentage of total assets was primarily due to the\nincreased economic concerns forecasted in the CECL model specific to office and multifamily markets in metro areas. The\nallowance for loan losses was $41.8 million, or 0.94% of total loans, at September 30, 2023.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of $2.3 million, compared\nto a provision of $6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a reversal of provision of $0.9 million for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024.

However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the\nevaluation of our performance. These include the following fully taxable-equivalent measures (“FTE”): (i) Net interest income\n(FTE), (ii) net interest margin (FTE), (iii) net interest spread (FTE), and (iv) efficiency ratio (FTE), which include the effects of\ntaxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a tax-\nequivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such,\nthese tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments.\nNet interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE). Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP\nmeasure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted\nunder GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of\nnet interest income and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The\nmost directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest\nmargin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial\nmeasure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the\naverage yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing\nliabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread.\nEfficiency ratio (FTE). The efficiency ratio (FTE) is a non-GAAP measure that provides a measure of productivity in the\nbanking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. The ratio is designed to\nreflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. We calculate this ratio by\ndividing noninterest expense, excluding amortization expense on intangibles and certain nonrecurring expense by the sum of\nnet interest income (FTE) and noninterest income, excluding net gain (loss) on sale of securities available for sale and certain\nnonrecurring impairments. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our\nefficiency ratio.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank\nholding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a\nnon-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and\nsuch comparable GAAP measure.\nManagement believes adjusting net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons.\nTax-equivalent adjustments are reflected in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the “Average Balances with\nAverage Yields and Rates” tables.\nA reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included at the end of the\nfinancial statement tables.\nPage-4\nAbout Southside Bancshares, Inc.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. is a bank holding company with approximately $8.36 billion in assets as of September 30, 2024, that\nowns 100% of Southside Bank.

Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nIn this report, the words “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the combined entities of Southside Bancshares, Inc. and\nits subsidiaries, including Southside Bank. The words “Southside” and “Southside Bancshares” refer to Southside Bancshares,\nInc. The words “Southside Bank” and “the Bank” refer to Southside Bank.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim\nfinancial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, not all\ninformation required by GAAP for complete financial statements is included in these interim statements. In the opinion of\nmanagement, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such financial statements have been included. Such\nadjustments consisted only of normal recurring items. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve matters of\njudgment. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.\nInterim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction\nwith the financial statements and notes thereto in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nAccounting Changes and Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts may be reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n2. Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated based on the two-class method in accordance with ASC Topic 260, “Earnings\nPer Share.” ASC 260 provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the calculation of earnings\nper share pursuant to the two-class method. We have determined that our director’s deferred RSUs are participating securities.\nUnder the two-class method, basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income available to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding outstanding\nparticipating securities. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated using the weighted-average number of shares\ndetermined for the basic earnings per common share calculation plus the dilutive effect of stock awards using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nEarnings per share on a basic and diluted basis are calculated as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic and Diluted Earnings:\nNet income........................................................................................................ $ 20,524 $ 18,449 $ 66,708 $ 69,376\nLess: Earnings allocated to participating securities.......................................... 14 10 41 29\nNet income available to common shareholders................................................... $ 20,510 $ 18,439 $ 66,667 $ 69,347\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding........................................................ 30,286 30,502 30,276 30,862\nAdd: Stock awards........................................................................................... 84 41 56 54\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding..................................................... 30,370 30,543 30,332 30,916\nBasic earnings per share:\nNet income........................................................................................................ $ 0.68 $ 0.60 $ 2.20 $ 2.25\nDiluted earnings per share:\nNet income........................................................................................................ $ 0.68 $ 0.60 $ 2.20 $ 2.24\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were approximately 539,000 and 534,000 anti-dilutive shares\noutstanding, respectively.

For those AFS debt securities in an unrealized loss position that do not meet either\nof these criteria, management assesses whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit-related factors, using both\nqualitative and quantitative criteria. Determining the allowance under the credit loss method requires the use of a discounted\ncash flow method to assess the credit losses. Any credit-related impairment will be recognized in allowance for credit losses on\nthe balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Noncredit-related temporary impairment, the portion of the\nimpairment relating to factors other than credit (such as changes in market interest rates), is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, net of tax.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have an allowance for credit losses on our AFS securities, based\non our consideration of the qualitative factors associated with each security type in our AFS portfolio. The unrealized losses on\nour investment and MBS are due to changes in interest rates and spreads and other market conditions. We had 271 AFS debt\nsecurities in an unrealized loss position at September 30, 2024. Our state and political subdivisions are highly rated municipal\nsecurities with a long history of no credit losses. Our AFS MBS are highly rated securities which are either explicitly or\nimplicitly backed by the U.S. Government through its agencies which are highly rated by major ratings agencies and also have a\nlong history of no credit losses. Our corporate bonds and other investment securities consist of primarily investment grade bonds\nand private placement bonds.\nWe assess the likelihood of default and the potential amount of default when assessing our HTM securities for credit losses. We\nutilize term structures and, due to no prior loss exposure on our state and political subdivision securities or our corporate\nsecurities, we currently apply a third-party average loss given default rate to model these securities. We elected to use the\nspecific identification method to model our HTM securities which aligns with our third-party fair value measurement process.\nAs of September 30, 2024, two bonds were rated below investment grade. The model determined any expected credit loss over\nthe life of these securities to be insignificant. Management further evaluated the remote expectation of loss on the remainder of\nthe HTM portfolio, along with the qualitative factors associated with these securities and concluded that, due to the securities\nbeing highly rated municipals and primarily investment grade corporates, private placement bonds with a long history of no\ncredit losses, no credit loss should be recognized for these securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or\n2023.\nThe accrued interest receivable on our debt securities is excluded from the credit loss estimate and is included in interest\nreceivable on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM debt\nsecurities totaled $8.4 million and $8.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable on AFS and\nHTM debt securities totaled $15.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. No HTM debt securities were past-due or on\nnonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThe following table reflects interest income recognized on securities for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nU.S. Treasury........................................................................................................................................... $ 2,315 $ 3,784\nState and political subdivisions................................................................................................................ 12,994 16,940\nCorporate bonds and other....................................................................................................................... 1,654 1,765\nMBS......................................................................................................................................................... 11,976 4,426\nTotal interest income on securities.......................................................................................................... $ 28,939 $ 26,915\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nU.S. Treasury........................................................................................................................................... $ 6,404 $ 8,307\nState and political subdivisions............................................................................................................... 41,151 50,940\nCorporate bonds and other...................................................................................................................... 5,182 5,363\nMBS........................................................................................................................................................ 33,179 12,585\nTotal interest income on securities.......................................................................................................... $ 85,916 $ 77,195\nThere was a $2.5 million net realized loss as a result of sales from the AFS securities portfolio for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, which consisted of $6.1 million in realized losses and $88,000 in realized gains, offset by a net gain of $3.5\nmillion on the unwinding of fair value hedges on municipal securities in the AFS securities portfolio. In addition, during the\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |16\nTable of Contents\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment charge of $868,000 consisting of a loss of $685,000 on the\nsale of approximately $10.0 million of AFS municipal securities and a loss of $183,000 on the unwind of the related fair value\nhedges, sold on October 1, 2024. There was a $5.6 million net realized loss as a result of sales from the AFS securities portfolio\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of $7.0 million in realized losses and $1.4 million in realized\ngains. There were no sales from the HTM portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We\ncalculate realized gains and losses on sales of securities under the specific identification method.\nExpected maturities on our securities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay\nobligations. MBS are presented in total by category since MBS are typically issued with stated principal amounts and are backed\nby pools of mortgages that have loans with varying maturities. The characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, such as\nfixed-rate or adjustable-rate, as well as prepayment risk, are passed on to the security holder. The term of a mortgage-backed\npass-through security thus approximates the term of the underlying mortgages and can vary significantly due to prepayments.\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of AFS and HTM securities at September 30, 2024, are presented below by\ncontractual maturity (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\nAVAILABLE FOR SALE\nInvestment securities:\nDue in one year or less..................................................................................................................... $ 176,356 $ 176,436\nDue after one year through five years.............................................................................................. 1,797 1,810\nDue after five years through ten years.............................................................................................. 25,600 25,193\nDue after ten years............................................................................................................................ 453,785 422,014\n657,538 625,453\nMBS:.................................................................................................................................................... 775,559 782,984\nTotal.................................................................................................................................................. $ 1,433,097 $ 1,408,437\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\nHELD TO MATURITY\nInvestment securities:\nDue in one year or less..................................................................................................................... $ 4,118 $ 4,087\nDue after one year through five years.............................................................................................. 11,920 11,695\nDue after five years through ten years.............................................................................................. 141,206 131,105\nDue after ten years............................................................................................................................ 1,015,088 913,482\n1,172,332 1,060,369\nMBS:.................................................................................................................................................... 116,071 109,154\nTotal.................................................................................................................................................. $ 1,288,403 $ 1,169,523\nEquity Investments\nEquity investments on our consolidated balance sheets include Community Reinvestment Act funds with a readily determinable\nfair value as well as equity investments without readily determinable fair values.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nLoans in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are classified as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReal estate loans:\nConstruction............................................................................................................ $ 585,817 $ 789,744\n1-4 family residential.............................................................................................. 755,406 696,738\nCommercial............................................................................................................. 2,422,612 2,168,451\nCommercial loans...................................................................................................... 358,854 366,893\nMunicipal loans.......................................................................................................... 402,041 441,168\nLoans to individuals................................................................................................... 53,318 61,516\nTotal loans.................................................................................................................. 4,578,048 4,524,510\nLess: Allowance for loan losses.............................................................................. 44,276 42,674\nNet loans.................................................................................................................... $ 4,533,772 $ 4,481,836\nConstruction Real Estate Loans\nOur construction loans are collateralized by property located primarily in or near the market areas we serve. A number of our\nconstruction loans will be owner occupied upon completion. Construction loans for non-owner occupied projects are financed,\nbut these typically have cash flows from leases with tenants, secondary sources of repayment, and in some cases, additional\ncollateral. Our construction loans have both adjustable and fixed interest rates during the construction period. Construction\nloans to individuals are typically priced and made with the intention of granting the permanent loan on the completed property.\nCommercial construction loans are subject to underwriting standards similar to that of the commercial real estate loan\nportfolio. Owner occupied 1-4 family residential construction loans are subject to the underwriting standards of the permanent\nloan.\n1-4 Family Residential Real Estate Loans\nResidential loan originations are generated by our mortgage loan officers, in-house origination staff, marketing efforts, present\ncustomers, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate agents and builders. We focus our lending efforts primarily on the\norigination of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied 1-4 family residences. Substantially all of our 1-4 family\nresidential originations are secured by properties located in or near our market areas.\nOur 1-4 family residential loans generally have maturities ranging from 15 to 30 years. These loans are typically fully\namortizing with monthly payments sufficient to repay the total amount of the loan. Our 1-4 family residential loans are made at\nboth fixed and adjustable interest rates.\nUnderwriting for 1-4 family residential loans includes debt-to-income analysis, credit history analysis, appraised value and\ndown payment considerations. Changes in the market value of real estate can affect the potential losses in the residential\nportfolio.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans\nCommercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024 consisted of $1.85 billion of owner and non-owner occupied real estate,\n$547.7 million of loans secured by multi-family properties and $27.7 million of loans secured by farmland. Commercial real\nestate loans primarily include loans collateralized by retail, commercial office buildings, multi-family residential buildings,\nmedical facilities and offices, senior living, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, warehouse facilities, hotels and\nchurches. In determining whether to originate commercial real estate loans, we generally consider such factors as the financial\ncondition of the borrower and the debt service coverage of the property. Commercial real estate loans are made at both fixed\nand adjustable interest rates for terms generally up to 20 years.\nCommercial Loans\nOur commercial loans are diversified loan types including short-term working capital loans for inventory and accounts\nreceivable and short- and medium-term loans for equipment or other business capital expansion. In our commercial loan\nunderwriting, we assess the creditworthiness, ability to repay and the value and liquidity of the collateral being offered. Terms\nof commercial loans are generally commensurate with the useful life of the collateral offered.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |19\nTable of Contents\nMunicipal Loans\nWe have made loans to municipalities and school districts primarily throughout the state of Texas, with a small percentage\noriginating outside of the state. The majority of the loans to municipalities and school districts have tax or revenue pledges and\nin some cases are additionally supported by collateral. Municipal loans made without a direct pledge of taxes or revenues are\nusually made based on some type of collateral that represents an essential service. These loans allow us to earn a higher yield\nthan we could if we purchased municipal securities for similar durations.\nLoans to Individuals\nSubstantially all originations of our loans to individuals are made to consumers in our market areas. The majority of loans to\nindividuals are collateralized by titled equipment, which are primarily automobiles. Loan terms vary according to the type and\nvalue of collateral, length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower. The underwriting standards we employ for\nconsumer loans include an application, a determination of the applicant’s payment history on other debts, with the greatest\nweight being given to payment history with us and an assessment of the borrower’s ability to meet existing obligations and\npayments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is a primary consideration, the underwriting\nprocess also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Most of our\nloans to individuals are collateralized, which management believes assists in limiting our exposure.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nWe categorize loans into risk categories on an ongoing basis based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to\nservice their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public\ninformation and current economic trends, among other factors. We use the following definitions for risk ratings:\n• Pass (Rating 1 – 4) – This rating is assigned to all satisfactory loans. This category, by definition, consists of\nacceptable credit. Credit and collateral exceptions should not be present, although their presence would not\nnecessarily prohibit a loan from being rated Pass, if deficiencies are in the process of correction. These loans are not\nincluded in the Watch List.\n• Pass Watch (Rating 5) – These loans require some degree of special treatment, but not due to credit quality. This\ncategory does not include loans specially mentioned or adversely classified; however, particular attention is\nwarranted to characteristics such as:\n▪ A lack of, or abnormally extended payment program;\n▪ A heavy degree of concentration of collateral without sufficient margin;\n▪ A vulnerability to competition through lesser or extensive financial leverage; and\n▪ A dependence on a single or few customers or sources of supply and materials without suitable substitutes\nor alternatives.\n• Special Mention (Rating 6) – A Special Mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close\nattention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for\nthe loan or in our credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not\nexpose us to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.\n• Substandard (Rating 7) – Substandard loans are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying\ncapacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or\nweaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the\nBank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\n• Doubtful (Rating 8) – Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard\nwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation, in full, on the basis of currently\nknown facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.\nWatch List loans reported as 2024 originations as of September 30, 2024 and Watch List loans reported as 2023 originations\nas of December 31, 2023 were, for the majority, first originated in various years prior to 2024 and 2023, respectively, but\nwere renewed in the respective year.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |20\nTable of Contents\nThe following

and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nWe reversed $13,000 and $75,000 of interest income on nonaccrual loans during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, respectively, and $13,000 and $78,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We had\n$4.5 million and $1.0 million of loans on nonaccrual for which there was no related allowance for credit losses as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nCollateral-dependent loans are loans that we expect the repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of\nthe collateral of the loan and for which we have determined that the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. In such cases,\nexpected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for selling costs. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $11.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, of collateral-dependent\nloans, secured mainly by real estate and equipment. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures the\ncollateral-dependent assets. Foreclosed assets include OREO and repossessed assets. For 1-4 family residential real estate\nproperties, a loan is recognized as a foreclosed property once legal title to the real estate property has been received upon\ncompletion of foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed all interest in the residential property through a deed in lieu of\nforeclosure. There were no loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in\nprocess as of September 30, 2024. There were $1.0 million loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in process as of December 31, 2023.\nRestructured Loans\nA loan is considered restructured if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan has been modified.\nModifications may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, restructuring amortization schedules and other\nactions intended to minimize potential losses. We may provide a combination of modifications which may include an extension\nof the amortization period, interest rate reduction and/or converting the loan to interest-only for a limited period of time. In\nmost instances, interest will continue to be charged on principal balances outstanding during the extended term. Therefore, the\nfinancial effects of the recorded investment of loans restructured during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not\nsignificant.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |24\nTable of Contents\nThere was one restructured loan totaling $25,000 with an extension of the amortization period during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. There were three restructured loans totaling $362,000 included in nonperforming assets as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were four restructured loans totaling $358,000\nof which $293,000 had an extension of the amortization period and $65,000 had a combination of an extension of the\namortization period and an interest rate reduction.\nOn an ongoing basis, performance of restructured loans are monitored for subsequent payment default. Payment default is\nrecognized when the borrower is 90 days or more past due. As of September 30, 2024, there was one restructured loan totaling\n$289,000 in default. There were no loans in default as of September 30, 2023. Payment defaults for restructured loans did not\nsignificantly impact the determination of the allowance for loan losses in the periods presented. At September 30, 2024, there\nwere no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans had been restructured.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe following tables detail activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the periods presented (in\nthousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal Estate\n1-4 Family Commercial Municipal Loans to\nConstruction Residential Commercial Loans Loans Individuals Total\nBalance at beginning of\nperiod............................... $ 4,734 $ 2,704 $ 31,841 $ 2,942 $ 18 $ 168 $ 42,407\nLoans charged-off......... — (133) — (127) — (513) (773)\nRecoveries of loans\ncharged-off.................... — 47 1 92 — 225 365\nNet loans (charged-off)\nrecovered....................... — (86) 1 (35) — (288) (408)\nProvision for (reversal\nof) loan losses................ 421 172 1,917 (507) (3) 277 2,277\nBalance at end of period.. $ 5,155 $ 2,790 $ 33,759 $ 2,400 $ 15 $ 157 $ 44,276\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal Estate\n1-4 Family Commercial Municipal Loans to\nConstruction Residential Commercial Loans Loans Individuals Total\nBalance at beginning of\nperiod............................... $ 5,287 $ 2,840 $ 32,266 $ 2,086 $ 19 $ 176 $ 42,674\nLoans charged-off (1).....

Southside Bank has three unsecured lines of credit for the purchase of overnight federal funds at\nprevailing rates with Frost Bank, Amegy Bank and TIB – The Independent Bankers Bank for $40.0 million, $25.0 million and\n$15.0 million, respectively. There were no federal funds purchased at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. To provide\nmore liquidity in response to economic conditions in recent years, the Federal Reserve has encouraged broader use of the\ndiscount window. At September 30, 2024, the amount of additional funding the Bank could obtain from the FRDW,\ncollateralized by securities, was approximately $352.6 million. There were $25.0 million in borrowings from the FRDW at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and $300.0 million at December 31, 2023. To provide more stability and to assure banks have the ability\nto meet the needs of all of their depositors, the Federal Reserve created the BTFP in the first quarter of 2023. On March 11,\n2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new BTFP advances. There were no remaining borrowings from the BTFP at\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared to $117.7 million at December 31, 2023. Southside Bank has a $5.0 million line of credit with\nFrost Bank to be used to issue letters of credit, and at September 30, 2024, the line had one outstanding letter of credit for\n$155,000. Southside Bank currently has one outstanding letter of credit from FHLB held as collateral for a loan for $6.1\nmillion.\nSouthside Bank enters into sales of securities under repurchase agreements. These repurchase agreements totaled $80.8 million\nat September 30, 2024 and $92.1 million at December 31, 2023, and had maturities of less than 1.0 year.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOur hedging policy allows the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk or hedge\nspecified assets and liabilities. These instruments may include interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors. All\nderivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value and are recorded in other assets or other\nliabilities, as appropriate.\nDerivative instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate assets or liabilities, cash flow hedges of\nforecasted transactions, fair value hedges of a recognized asset or liability or as non-hedging instruments.\nCash Flow Hedges\nGains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI to the extent they are\neffective. If the hedge is effective, the amount recorded in other comprehensive income is reclassified to interest expense in the\nsame periods that the hedged cash flows impact earnings. We have entered into certain interest rate swap contracts on specific\nvariable rate agreements and fixed rate short-term pay agreements with third parties. These interest rate swap contracts were\ndesignated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815. The objective of the interest rate swap contracts\nis to manage the expected future cash flows on $790.0 million of Bank liabilities. The cash flows from the swap contracts are\nexpected to be highly effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the underlying\nSOFR rate.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 815, if a hedging item is terminated prior to maturity for a cash settlement, the existing gain or\nloss within AOCI will continue to be reclassified into earnings during the period or periods in which the hedged forecasted\ntransaction affects earnings unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally\nspecified time period. These transactions are reevaluated on a monthly basis to determine if the hedged forecasted transactions\nare still probable of occurring. If at a subsequent evaluation, it is determined that the transactions are probable of not occurring,\nany related gains or losses recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. During the third quarter of 2024, we\nterminated three interest rate swap contracts designated as a cash flow hedge, and during the second quarter of 2023, we\nterminated one interest rate swap contract designated as a cash flow hedge. At the time of termination, we determined the\nhedged forecasted transactions were still probable of occurring. The existing loss in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings in\nthe same periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nFair Value Hedges\nGains and losses on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, as well as the change in fair value of the hedged\nitem, are recorded in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Gains and losses due to changes in fair value of\nthe interest rate swap agreements offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the hedged item. During 2022, we\nentered into partial term fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate callable AFS municipal securities. During 2024, we\nentered into partial term fair value hedges of fixed rate AFS MBS and fixed rate loans using the portfolio layer method. This\napproach allows us to designate as the hedged item a stated amount of the assets that are not expected to be affected by\nprepayments, defaults and other factors affecting the timing and amount of cash flows. The fair value portfolio level hedging\nadjustment on our hedged MBS portfolio and hedged loan portfolio has not been attributed to the individual AFS securities or\nindividual loans in our balance sheet. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the changes in the fair value of the\ninterest rate swap are expected to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the SOFR swap\nrate, the designated benchmark interest rate. These derivative contracts involve the receipt of floating rate interest from a\ncounterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement, without the exchange of the\nunderlying notional value. During 2024 and 2023, we terminated some of our securities fair value hedging relationships and\nsold the majority of the hedged items. As a result of the sale, the cumulative adjustments to the carrying amount was a fair value\nnet gain of $3.5 million and $6.5 million recognized in earnings and recorded in noninterest income during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the cumulative adjustments for\nfair value hedges (in thousands):\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value\nHedging Adjustments Included in the\nAmortized Cost of Hedged Assets (2) Carrying Amount of the Hedged Items\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 2023\nSecurities AFS (1) (3).................................... $ 991,699 $ 487,486 $ 3,581 $ 13,642\nLoans (1) (3)................................................... 271,383 — (385) —\n1) Amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio\nlayer method. The hedged item is a layer of the closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging\nrelationship. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed MBS portfolio used in these hedging\nrelationships was $625.9 million, the amount of the designated hedged items were $201.0 million and the cumulative amount\nof fair value hedging adjustments associated with these MBS hedging relationships was a loss of $1.2 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed loan portfolio used in these hedging relationships was $271.4\nmillion, the amount of the designated hedged items were $155.0 million and the cumulative amount of fair value hedging\nadjustments associated with these loan hedging relationships was a loss of $385,000.\n2) Excludes fair value hedging adjustments.\n3) Excluded from the table above are the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments for securities AFS and loans for\nwhich hedge accounting has been discontinued in the amounts of a loss of $4.6 million and a loss of $4.2 million,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2024. There were no discontinued hedges as of December 31, 2023.\nDerivatives Designated as Non-Hedging Instruments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into certain interest rate swaps, cap and floor contracts that are not designated as hedging\ninstruments. These interest rate derivative contracts relate to transactions in which we enter into an interest rate swap, cap or\nfloor with a customer while concurrently entering into an offsetting interest rate swap, cap or floor with a third-party financial\ninstitution. We agree to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable rate and receive interest from the\ncustomer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, we agree to pay a third-party financial\ninstitution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same\nnotional amount. These interest rate derivative contracts allow our customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a\nfixed rate loan. The changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts primarily offset each other and do not\nsignificantly impact our results of operations. We recognized swap fee income associated with these derivative contracts\nimmediately based upon the difference in the bid/ask spread of the underlying transactions with the customer and the third-party\nfinancial institution. The swap fee income is included in other noninterest income in our consolidated statements of income.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, net derivative assets included $22.3 million and $46.8 million, respectively, of\ncash collateral received from counterparties under master netting agreements.\nThe notional amounts of the derivative instruments represent the contractual cash flows pertaining to the underlying\nagreements. These amounts are not exchanged and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the\ninterest rate swaps are presented at net in other assets and other liabilities and in the net change in each of these financial\nstatement line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows when a right of offset exists, based on\ntransactions with a single counterparty that are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |31\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present the notional and estimated fair value amount of derivative positions outstanding (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nEstimated Fair Value Estimated Fair Value\nNotional Asset Liability Notional Asset Liability\nAmount (1) Derivative Derivative Amount (1) Derivative Derivative\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts:\nSwaps-Cash Flow Hedge-Financial institution\ncounterparties.................................................... $ 790,000 $ 12,880 $ 6,054 $ 1,010,000 $ 24,223 $ 6,910\nSwaps-Fair Value Hedge-Financial institution\ncounterparties.................................................... 675,875 5,781 2,748 453,440 13,658 16\nDerivatives designated as non-hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts:\nSwaps-Financial institution counterparties........ 241,446 14,355 649 248,073 18,249 509\nSwaps-Customer counterparties........................ 241,446 649 14,355 248,073 509 18,249\nGross derivatives.................................................... 33,665 23,806 56,639 25,684\nOffsetting derivative assets/liabilities....................

Fair Value Measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the\nliability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous\nmarket for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of\nthe asset or liability is not adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the\nmarket for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for\ntransactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in\nthe principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact.\nValuation techniques including the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach are utilized to determine\nfair value. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nliability. Valuation policies and procedures are determined by our investment department and reported to our ALCO for\nreview. An entity must consider all aspects of nonperforming risk, including the entity’s own credit standing, when\nmeasuring fair value of a liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or\nunobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. A fair\nvalue hierarchy for valuation inputs gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity\nhas the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets,\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks,\netc.) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity’s\nown assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\nCertain financial assets are measured at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments to the fair value of these assets\nusually result from the application of fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. A description of the\nvaluation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such\ninstruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.\nSecurities AFS and Equity Investments with readily determinable fair values – U.S. Treasury securities and equity\ninvestments with readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs. Other securities\nclassified as AFS are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For most of these securities, we obtain fair value\nmeasurements from independent pricing services and obtain an understanding of the pricing methodologies used by these\nindependent pricing services. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market\nspreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment\nspeeds, credit information and the bond’s terms and conditions, among other things, as stated in the pricing methodologies of\nthe independent pricing services.\nWe review and validate the prices supplied by the independent pricing services for reasonableness by comparison to prices\nobtained from, in some cases, two additional third-party sources. For securities where prices are outside a reasonable range,\nwe further review those securities, based on internal ALCO approved procedures, to determine what a reasonable fair value\nmeasurement is for those securities, given available data.\nDerivatives – Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. We obtain fair value measurements from two\nsources including an independent pricing service and the counterparty to the derivatives designated as hedges. The fair value\nmeasurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live\ntrading levels, trade execution data, credit information and the derivatives’ terms and conditions, among other things. We\nreview the prices supplied by the sources for reasonableness. In addition, we obtain a basic understanding of their underlying\npricing methodology. We validate prices supplied by the sources by comparison to one another.\nCertain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include reporting units\nmeasured at fair value and tested for goodwill impairment.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |34\nTable of Contents\nCertain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which means that the\ninstruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain\ncircumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment). Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis included foreclosed assets and collateral-dependent loans at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nForeclosed Assets – Foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell. The fair value measurements of\nforeclosed assets can include Level 2 measurement inputs such as real estate appraisals and comparable real estate sales\ninformation, in conjunction with Level 3 measurement inputs such as cash flow projections, qualitative adjustments and sales\ncost estimates. As a result, the categorization of foreclosed assets is Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In connection with\nthe measurement and initial recognition of certain foreclosed assets, we may recognize charge-offs through the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans – Certain loans may be reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is\nexpected substantially from the operation or sale of the collateral. Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs based\non customized discounting criteria or appraisals. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the impact of the fair value\nof collateral-dependent loans was reflected in our allowance for loan losses.\nThe fair value estimate of financial instruments for which quoted market prices are unavailable is dependent upon the\nassumptions used. Consequently, those estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in\nmany cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts\npresented in the fair value tables do not necessarily represent their underlying value.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |35\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis segregated by the level of\nthe valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at the End of the\nReporting Period Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Assets Inputs Inputs\nSeptember 30, 2024 Amount (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nRecurring fair value measurements\nInvestment securities:\nU.S. Treasury......................................................................... $ 174,167 $ 174,167 $ — $ —\nState and political subdivisions............................................. 436,927 — 436,927 —\nCorporate bonds and other..................................................... 14,359 — 14,359 —\nMBS: (1)\nResidential............................................................................. 778,093 — 778,093 —\nCommercial............................................................................ 4,891 — 4,891 —\nEquity investments:\nEquity investments................................................................. 5,421 5,421 — —\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps.................................................................. 33,665 — 33,665 —\nTotal asset recurring fair value measurements......................... $ 1,447,523 $ 179,588 $ 1,267,935 $ —\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps.................................................................. $ 23,806 $ — $ 23,806 $ —\nTotal liability recurring fair value measurements..................... $ 23,806 $ — $ 23,806 $ —\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nForeclosed assets...................................................................... $ 402 $ — $ — $ 402\nCollateral-dependent loans (2)................................................... 10,953 — — 10,953\nTotal asset nonrecurring fair value measurements................... $ 11,355 $ — $ — $ 11,355\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |36\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Measurements at the End of the\nReporting Period Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Assets Inputs Inputs\nDecember 31, 2023 Amount (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nRecurring fair value measurements\nInvestment securities:\nU.S. Treasury......................................................................... $ 139,725 $ 139,725 $ — $ —\nState and political subdivisions............................................. 568,745 — 568,745 —\nCorporate bonds and other..................................................... 14,093 — 14,093 —\nMBS: (1)\nResidential............................................................................. 568,983 — 568,983 —\nCommercial............................................................................ 4,748 — 4,748 —\nEquity investments:\nEquity investments................................................................. 5,308 5,308 — —\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate swaps.................................................................. 56,639 — 56,639 —\nTotal asset recurring fair value measurements......................... $ 1,358,241 $ 145,033 $ 1,213,208 $ —\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate swaps.................................................................. $ 25,684 $ — $ 25,684 $ —\nTotal liability recurring fair value measurements..................... $ 25,684 $ — $ 25,684 $ —\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nForeclosed assets...................................................................... $ 99 $ — $ — $ 99\nCollateral-dependent loans (2)................................................... 7,000 — — 7,000\nTotal asset nonrecurring fair value measurements................... $ 7,099 $ — $ — $ 7,099\n(1) All MBS are issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. GSEs.\n(2) Consists of individually evaluated loans. Loans for which the fair value of the collateral and commercial real estate fair\nvalue of the properties is less than cost basis are presented net of allowance. Losses on these loans represent charge-offs\nwhich are netted against the allowance for loan losses.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |37\nTable of Contents\nDisclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, is required\nwhen it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on\nestimates using present value or other estimation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions\nused, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Such techniques and assumptions, as they apply to\nindividual categories of our financial instruments, are as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents – The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of those\nassets’ fair value.\nInvestment and MBS HTM – Fair values for these securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If\nquoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar securities or\nestimates from independent pricing services.\nFHLB stock – The carrying amount of FHLB stock is a reasonable estimate of the fair value of those assets.\nEquity investments – The carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured\nat cost less impairment, if any, adjusted for observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the\nsame issuer. This carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value of those assets.\nLoans receivable – We estimate the fair value of our loan portfolio to an exit price notion with adjustments for\nliquidity, credit and prepayment factors. Nonperforming loans continue to be estimated using discounted cash flow\nanalyses or the underlying value of the collateral where applicable.\nLoans held for sale – The fair value of loans held for sale is determined based on expected proceeds, which are\nbased on sales contracts and commitments.\nDeposit liabilities – The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the\namount on demand at the reporting date, which is the carrying value. Fair values for fixed rate CDs are estimated\nusing a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered for deposits of similar\nremaining maturities.\nOther borrowings – Federal funds purchased generally have original terms to maturity of one day and repurchase\nagreements generally have terms of less than one year, and therefore both are considered short-term borrowings.\nConsequently, their carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value. Borrowings from the Federal Reserve\nthrough the FRDW and BTFP have original maturities of one year or less, and the fair value is estimated by\ndiscounting the future cash flows using rates at which borrowings would be made to borrowers with similar credit\nratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nFHLB borrowings – The fair value of these borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using rates\nat which borrowings would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nSubordinated notes – The fair value of the subordinated notes is estimated by discounting future cash flows using\nestimated rates at which long-term debt would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the\nremaining maturities.\nTrust preferred subordinated debentures – The fair value of the long-term debt is estimated by discounting future\ncash flows using estimated rates at which long-term debt would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and\nfor the remaining maturities.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |38\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present our financial assets and financial liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis at both their\nrespective carrying amounts and estimated fair value (in thousands):\nEstimated Fair Value\nCarrying\nSeptember 30, 2024 Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents...................................................... $ 486,297 $ 486,297 $ 486,297 $ — $ —\nInvestment securities:\nHTM, at carrying value........................................................ 1,172,332 1,060,369 — 1,060,369 —\nMBS:\nHTM, at carrying value........................................................ 116,071 109,154 — 109,154 —\nFHLB stock, at cost ............................................................... 40,291 40,291 — 40,291 —\nEquity investments................................................................. 4,301 4,301 — 4,301 —\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses.................................. 4,533,772 4,418,820 — — 4,418,820\nLoans held for sale................................................................. 768 768 — 768 —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits.................................................................................. $ 6,435,702 $ 6,436,589 $ — $ 6,436,589 $ —\nOther borrowings.................................................................... 105,810 105,668 — 105,668 —\nFHLB borrowings................................................................... 760,046 755,052 — 755,052 —\nSubordinated notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs.. 92,006 85,253 — 85,253 —\nTrust preferred subordinated debentures, net of unamortized\ndebt issuance costs.................................................................. 60,273 51,946 — 51,946 —\nEstimated Fair Value\nCarrying\nDecember 31, 2023 Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents...................................................... $ 560,510 $ 560,510 $ 560,510 $ — $ —\nInvestment securities:\nHTM, at carrying value........................................................ 1,186,152 1,054,739 — 1,054,739 —\nMortgage-backed securities:\nHTM, at carrying value........................................................ 120,901 111,423 — 111,423 —\nFHLB stock, at cost ............................................................... 11,936 11,936 — 11,936 —\nEquity investments................................................................. 4,383 4,383 — 4,383 —\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses.................................. 4,481,836 4,198,879 — — 4,198,879\nLoans held for sale................................................................. 10,894 10,894 — 10,894 —\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits.................................................................................. $ 6,549,681 $ 6,534,929 $ — $ 6,534,929 $ —\nOther borrowings.................................................................... 509,820 510,242 — 510,242 —\nFHLB borrowings................................................................... 212,648 202,750 — 202,750 —\nSubordinated notes, net of unamortized debt issuance costs.. 93,877 86,285 — 86,285 —\nTrust preferred subordinated debentures, net of unamortized\ndebt issuance costs.................................................................. 60,270 57,480 — 57,480 —\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |39\nTable of Contents\n11.

No valuation allowance was recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, as management\nbelieves it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset items will be realized in future years. Unrecognized tax\nbenefits were not material at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nWe recognized income tax expense of $4.4 million and $14.2 million for an ETR of 17.6% for both the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $3.1 million and $12.2 million for an ETR of\n14.5% and 15.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The higher ETR for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in net tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax\nincome as compared to the same period in 2023. The ETR differs from the statutory rate of 21% for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal loans and securities, as\nwell as BOLI. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdictions and in certain states. We are no longer subject to\nU.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021 or Texas state tax examinations by tax\nauthorities for years before 2020.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |40\nTable of Contents\n12. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk. In the normal course of business, we are a party to certain financial\ninstruments with off-balance-sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance-sheet instruments\ninclude commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of\ncredit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount reflected in the financial statements. The contract or notional amounts of\nthese instruments reflect the extent of involvement and exposure to credit loss that we have in these particular classes of\nfinancial instruments. The allowance for credit losses on these off-balance-sheet credit exposures is calculated using the same\nmethodology as loans including a conversion or usage factor to anticipate ultimate exposure and expected losses and is included\nin other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period..................................................... $ 3,208 $ 3,207 $ 3,932 $ 3,687\nProvision for (reversal of) off-balance-sheet credit exposures..... 112 646 (612) 166\nBalance at end of period............................................................... $ 3,320 $ 3,853 $ 3,320 $ 3,853\nContractual commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer provided the terms established in the contract\nare met. Commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates and may require the payment of fees. Since some\ncommitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent\nfuture cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a\ncustomer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The\ncredit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in commitments to extend credit and\nsimilarly do not necessarily represent future cash obligations.\nFinancial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk were as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommitments to extend credit................................................................................... $ 877,223 $ 1,082,327\nStandby letters of credit............................................................................................. 17,927 10,823\nTotal...................................................................................................................... $ 895,150 $ 1,093,150\nWe apply the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as we do for on-\nbalance-sheet instruments. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral\nobtained, if deemed necessary, upon extension of credit is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Collateral\nheld varies but may include cash or cash equivalents, negotiable instruments, real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, oil, gas\nand mineral interests, property, plant and equipment.\nLeases. There were no operating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were $372,000\nand $603,000, respectively, of operating lease ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities.\nSecurities. In the normal course of business, we buy and sell securities. At September 30, 2024, there were $19.9 million\nunsettled trades to purchase securities and no unsettled trades to sell securities. At December 31, 2023, there were no unsettled\ntrades to purchase securities and no unsettled trades to sell securities.\nDeposits. There were no unsettled issuances of brokered CDs at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nLitigation. We are involved with various litigation in the normal course of business. Management, after consulting with our\nlegal counsel, believes that any liability resulting from litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results\nof operations or liquidity.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |41\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition, changes in our financial condition and results of our\noperations, and should be read and reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements, and the notes thereto, in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our 2023 Form 10-K. Certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those set\nforth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of the 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nmay cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements appearing in this\ndiscussion and analysis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this report may be considered to be “forward-looking\nstatements” within the meaning of and subject to the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, nor should they be relied upon as\nrepresenting management’s views as of any subsequent date. These statements may include words such as “expect,”\n“estimate,” “project,” “anticipate,” “appear,” “believe,” “could,” “should,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “seek,” “intend,”\n“probability,” “risk,” “goal,” “target,” “objective,” “plans,” “potential,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements\nare statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, expectations, objectives, goals, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions\nand future performance and are subject to significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. For example, benefits of the Share\nRepurchase Plan, trends in asset quality, capital, liquidity, our ability to sell nonperforming assets, expense reductions, planned\noperational efficiencies and earnings from growth and certain market risk disclosures, including the impact of interest rates and\nour expectations regarding rate increases, tax reform, inflation, the impacts related to or resulting from other economic factors\nare based upon information presently available to management and are dependent on choices about key model characteristics\nand assumptions and are subject to various limitations. By their nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates\nand could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future. Accordingly, our results could materially differ from\nthose that have been estimated. The most significant factor that could cause future results to differ materially from those\nanticipated by our forward-looking statements include the ongoing impact of higher inflation levels, interest rate fluctuations\nand general economic and recessionary concerns, all of which could impact economic growth and could cause a reduction in\nfinancial transactions and business activities, including decreased deposits and reduced loan originations, our ability to manage\nliquidity in a rapidly changing and unpredictable market, labor shortages and changes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.\nOther factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements include, but\nare not limited to, the following:\n• general (i) political conditions, including, without limitation, governmental action and uncertainty resulting from U.S.\nand global political trends and (ii) economic conditions, either globally, nationally, in the State of Texas, or in the\nspecific markets in which we operate, including, without limitation, the deterioration of the commercial real estate,\nresidential real estate, construction and

We disclaim any obligation to update any factors or to announce publicly the result of revisions to any of the forward-\nlooking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments, unless otherwise required by law.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting and reporting estimates conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services\nindustry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We consider accounting\nestimates that can (1) be replaced by other reasonable estimates and/or (2) changes to an estimate from period to period that\nhave a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations as\nwell as (3) those estimates that require significant and complex assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain to be critical\naccounting estimates. We consider our critical accounting estimates to include allowance for credit losses on loans and off-\nbalance-sheet credit exposure.\nCritical accounting estimates include a high degree of uncertainty in the underlying assumptions. Management bases its\nestimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant. The development, selection and\ndisclosure of our critical accounting estimates are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nActual results could differ from these estimates. For additional information regarding critical accounting policies, refer to “Part\nII – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting\nEstimates,” “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses – Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures,” “Note 1 –\nSummary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies,” “Note 5 – Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses” and “Note 17 –\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies” in the 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, there\nhave been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |44\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of our performance. These include the\nfollowing fully taxable-equivalent measures: Net interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread\n(FTE), which include the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a federal income tax rate of 21% to increase tax-\nexempt interest income to a tax-equivalent basis. Interest income earned on certain assets is completely or partially exempt\nfrom federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments.\nNet interest income (FTE), net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread (FTE). Net interest income (FTE) is a non-GAAP\nmeasure that adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments and is not permitted\nunder GAAP in the consolidated statements of income. We believe this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of\nnet interest income, and that it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. The\nmost directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest income. Net interest\nmargin (FTE) is the ratio of net interest income (FTE) to average earning assets. The most directly comparable financial\nmeasure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest margin. Net interest spread (FTE) is the difference in the\naverage yield on average earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis and the average rate paid on average interest bearing\nliabilities. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is our net interest spread.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank\nholding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently. Whenever we present a\nnon-GAAP financial measure in an SEC filing, we are also required to present the most directly comparable financial measure\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and reconcile the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure and\nsuch comparable GAAP measure.\nIn the following table we present the reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income adjusted to a fully taxable-\nequivalent basis assuming a 21% marginal tax rate for interest earned on tax-exempt assets such as municipal loans and\ninvestment securities (dollars in thousands), along with the calculation of net interest margin (FTE) and net interest spread\n(FTE).\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet interest income (GAAP)....................................... $ 55,464 $ 53,273 $ 162,420 $ 160,542\nTax equivalent adjustments:\nLoans............................................................... 608 674 1,897 2,044\nTax-exempt investment securities................... 2,012 2,474 6,143 7,486\nNet interest income (FTE) (1).................................. $ 58,084 $ 56,421 $ 170,460 $ 170,072\nAverage earning assets................................................ $ 7,823,026 $ 7,418,157 $ 7,862,245 $ 7,269,326\nNet interest margin...................................................... 2.82 % 2.85 % 2.76 % 2.95 %\nNet interest margin (FTE) (1)....................................... 2.95 % 3.02 % 2.90 % 3.13 %\nNet interest spread....................................................... 2.10 % 2.14 % 2.04 % 2.31 %\nNet interest spread (FTE) (1)........................................ 2.23 % 2.31 % 2.18 % 2.48 %\n(1) These amounts are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent basis and are non-GAAP measures.\nManagement believes adjusting net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread to a fully taxable-equivalent\nbasis is a standard practice in the banking industry as these measures provide useful information to make peer comparisons.\nTax-equivalent adjustments are reported in the respective earning asset categories as listed in the “Average Balances with\nAverage Yields and Rates” tables under Results of Operations.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |45\nTable of Contents\nOVERVIEW\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe economic conditions and growth prospects for our markets, even against the headwinds of elevated inflation, interest rate\nfluctuations and potential recessionary concerns, continue to reflect a solid and positive overall outlook. Ongoing inflation\nlevels and continued higher interest rates could have a negative impact on both our consumer and commercial borrowers.\nCurrently, however, the Texas markets we serve continue to remain healthy due to both job and population growth.\nDEPOSITS\nOur deposits were $6.44 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $114.0 million, or 1.7%, from December 31, 2023. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had 179,214 total deposit accounts with an average balance of $32,000. Our estimated uninsured\ndeposits were 35.9% of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. When excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits)\nand public fund deposits (all collateralized), our total estimated deposits without insurance or collateral was 19.2% of total\ndeposits as of September 30, 2024.\nOur noninterest bearing deposits represent approximately 21.4% of total deposits. During the three months ended September\n30, 2024, our cost of interest bearing deposits increased 43 basis points from 2.58% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023 to 3.01%. Our cost of total deposits for the third quarter of 2024 increased 40 basis points from 1.98% for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 to 2.38%.\nOur cost of interest bearing deposits increased 83 basis points, from 2.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to\n2.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cost of total deposits increased 75 basis points, from 1.62% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nOur capital ratios and contingent liquidity sources remain solid. We utilized the Federal Reserve’s BTFP to reduce our overall\nfunding costs and to enhance our interest rate risk position. On March 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new\nBTFP advances. As of September 30, 2024, we had no remaining BTFP borrowings, compared to $117.7 million at a cost of\n4.37% at December 31, 2023.\nThe table below shows our total lines of credit, borrowings, total amounts available for future liquidity, and swapped value as\nof September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBorrowings Total Available\nand Letters of for Future\nLine of Credit Credit Liquidity Swapped\nFHLB advances........................................................................ $ 2,563,587 $ 766,175 $ 1,797,412 $ 310,000\nFederal Reserve discount window............................................ 377,559 25,000 352,559 —\nCorrespondent bank lines of credit........................................... 80,000 — 80,000 —\nTotal liquidity lines................................................................... $ 3,021,146 $ 791,175 $ 2,229,971 $ 310,000\nOperating Results\nNet income increased $2.1 million, or 11.2%, to $20.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nsame period in 2023. The increase in net income was a result of the $4.6 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and\nthe $2.2 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by the $2.7 million decrease in noninterest income, the $779,000\nincrease in noninterest expense, and the $1.3 million increase in income tax expense. Earnings per diluted common share was\n$0.68 and $0.60 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net income decreased $2.7 million, or 3.8%, to $66.7 million from\n$69.4 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily a result of the $3.9 million decrease in\nnoninterest income, the $3.6 million increase in noninterest expense, and the $2.0 million increase in income tax expense,\npartially offset by the $4.9 million decrease in provision for credit losses and the $1.9 million increase in net interest income.\nEarnings per diluted common share decreased $0.04, or 1.8%, to $2.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $2.24 for the same period in 2023.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |46\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition\nOur total assets increased $77.3 million, or 0.9%, to $8.36 billion at September 30, 2024 from $8.28 billion at December 31,\n2023. Our securities portfolio increased by $93.5 million, or 3.6%, to $2.70 billion, compared to $2.60 billion at December 31,\n2023. The increase in the securities portfolio was due to purchases of MBS, partially offset by a decrease in municipal bonds\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our FHLB stock increased $28.4 million, or 237.6%, to $40.3 million from\n$11.9 million at December 31, 2023, due to the increase in our FHLB borrowings during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024.\nLoans at September 30, 2024 were $4.58 billion, an increase of $53.5 million, or 1.2%, compared to December 31, 2023, due to\nincreases of $254.2 million in commercial real estate loans and $58.7 million in 1-4 family residential loans. The increases were\npartially offset by decreases of $203.9 million in construction loans, $39.1 million in municipal loans, $8.2 million in loans to\nindividuals and $8.0 million in commercial loans. Loans held for sale decreased $10.1 million, or 93.0%, to $768,000 at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $10.9 million at December 31, 2023 due to the sale of a $7.9 million commercial real estate loan\nrelationship during the first quarter of 2024.\nOur nonperforming assets at September 30, 2024 increased $3.7 million, or 91.4%, to $7.7 million and represented 0.09% of\ntotal assets, compared to $4.0 million, or 0.05% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. Nonaccruing loans increased $3.4\nmillion, or 86.5%, to $7.3 million, and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans was 0.16% and 0.09% for September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to one commercial real estate\nloan added during the third quarter of 2024. There were no restructured loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to $13,000\nat December 31, 2023. Repossessed assets were $14,000 at September 30, 2024. There were no repossessed assets at\nDecember 31, 2023. There was $388,000 and $99,000 of OREO at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOur deposits decreased $114.0 million, or 1.7%, with a balance of $6.44 billion at September 30, 2024 from $6.55 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, which consisted of decreases of $100.6 million in interest bearing deposits and $13.4 million in noninterest\nbearing deposits.\nTotal FHLB borrowings increased $547.4 million, or 257.4%, to $760.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $212.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOther borrowings decreased $404.0 million, or 79.2%, to $105.8 million at September 30, 2024, from $509.8 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, which was primarily due to a $275.0 million decrease in borrowings from the FRDW and a $117.7 million\ndecrease in borrowings from the BTFP.\nOur total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 increased 4.1%, or $32.0 million, to $805.3 million, or 9.6% of total\nassets, compared to $773.3 million, or 9.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders’ equity was the\nresult of net income of $66.7 million, stock compensation expense of $2.5 million, net issuance of common stock under\nemployee stock plans of $1.1 million and common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of $886,000, partially\noffset by cash dividends paid of $32.7 million, other comprehensive loss of $5.0 million and repurchases of $1.5 million of our\ncommon stock.\nKey financial indicators management follows include, but are not limited to, numerous interest rate sensitivity and interest rate\nrisk indicators, credit risk, operations risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, regulatory risk, inflation risk, competition risk, yield curve\nrisk, U.S. agency MBS prepayment risk and economic risk indicators.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |47\nTable of Contents\nBalance Sheet Strategy\nDetermining the appropriate size of the balance sheet is one of the critical decisions any bank makes. Our balance sheet is not\nmerely the result of a series of micro-decisions, but rather the size is controlled based on the economics of assets compared to\nthe economics of funding and funding sources. Changing interest rate environments and economic conditions require that we\nmonitor the interest rate sensitivity of the assets, the funding driving our growth and closely align ALCO objectives\naccordingly.\nWe ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $352.6 million in available liquidity from the FRDW, in addition to the\napproximately $1.80 billion credit line available from FHLB due primarily to the blanket lien on our loan portfolio and to a\nlesser extent, securities available as collateral. At September 30, 2024, the estimated deposits, without insurance or collateral,\nto total deposits, excluding affiliate deposits (Southside-owned deposits) was 19.2%, or $1.24 billion.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into an additional $50 million cash flow hedge interest rate\nswap contract while $150 million cash flow hedge interest rate swap contracts were terminated and $120 million matured. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, FHLB advances of $310 million and brokered deposits of $480 million were hedged with our $790 million\nof cash flow swaps. As of September 30, 2024, a pre-tax unrealized gain of $6.8 million was recognized in other comprehensive\nincome, and there was no ineffective portion of these hedges. We continue to evaluate the lowest cost wholesale funding\nsources and will utilize either brokered deposits, FHLB advances or FRDW borrowings, or a combination of the three funding\nsources in addition to utilizing cash flow hedges to mitigate the impacts of interest rate movements. At September 30, 2024, the\nmajority of the securities portfolio was funded by non-maturity deposits, some of which are included in wholesale funding that\naccounts for approximately 57% of the funding source, of which approximately 51% is swapped at a fixed rate, providing\nprotection from rising interest rates.\nWe utilize wholesale funding and securities to enhance overall profitability to determine the appropriate leverage of our capital,\ndetermining acceptable levels of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk consistent with prudent capital management. This\nbalance sheet strategy currently consists of borrowing funds from the brokered market, FHLB and the FRDW. These funds are\ninvested primarily in U.S. agency MBS and long-term municipal securities and to a lesser extent, U.S. Treasury Bills and\ncorporate securities. Although the securities purchased often carry lower yields than loans, these securities generally (i)\nincrease the overall quality of our assets because of either the implicit or explicit guarantees of the U.S. Government, and the\nguarantees of the municipalities, (ii) are more liquid than individual loans and (iii) may be used to collateralize our borrowings\nor other obligations.\nRisks associated with this asset structure include a potentially lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to our\npeers, changes in the slope of the yield curve, increased interest rate risk, the length of interest rate cycles, changes in volatility\nor spreads associated with the MBS, municipal and corporate securities, the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments and\ncredit risks associated with the municipal and corporate securities. See “Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our\nBusiness” in the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to interest rates. An additional risk is significant increases in\ninterest rates, especially long-term interest rates, which could adversely impact the fair value of the AFS securities portfolio and\ncould also impact our equity capital. Due to the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments, the length of interest rate cycles\nand the slope of the interest rate yield curve, net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under the scenarios\nmodeled by our ALCO and described under “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOur securities portfolio increased from $2.60 billion at December 31, 2023 to $2.70 billion at September 30, 2024. The\nincrease in the securities portfolio was due to securities purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which\nmore than offset sales of securities and principal payments.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we continued to adjust the composition of the securities portfolio as U.S.\nTreasury Bills and MBS increased while the remaining categories in the portfolio decreased. The increase in MBS was\nattributable to purchases of U.S. Agency MBS, partially offset by MBS principal payments. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we purchased $482.9 million in short-term U.S. Treasury Bills to collateralize public fund deposits and\n$289.0 million in low premium, primarily 5.0% to 6.5% coupon MBS and to a lesser extent, discounted 4.0% to 5.5% coupon\nMBS. Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included $128.8 million in municipal securities and in most\ninstances the unwinding of the related fair value hedges to align the investment portfolio with the current balance sheet strategy.\nSales of AFS securities and the related fair value hedge unwinds for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nresulted in a net realized loss of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively. In addition, during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recorded an impairment loss of $868,000 on the sale of approximately $10.0 million in AFS municipal\nsecurities and the unwind of the related fair value hedges, sold on October 1, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, securities as a percentage of assets totaled 32.3%, compared to 31.4% at December 31, 2023, due to a\n$93.5 million, or 3.6%, increase in securities, while cash and cash equivalents decreased to 5.8% of total assets at\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |48\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 6.8% at December 31, 2023. Our balance sheet management strategy is dynamic and is\ncontinually evaluated as market conditions warrant.\nDuring 2022, we entered into partial term fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate callable AFS municipal securities.\nDuring 2024, we entered into partial term fair value hedges of fixed rate AFS MBS and fixed rate municipal loans using the\nportfolio layer method. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the changes in the fair value of the interest rate\nswap are expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate,\nthe designated benchmark interest rate. As of September 30, 2024, hedged municipal securities with a carrying amount of\n$336.9 million are included in our AFS securities portfolio in our consolidated balance sheets representing approximately 77%\nof the AFS municipal portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, $201.0 million in hedging instruments were used to hedge a layer\nof the closed portfolio of AFS MBS with a carrying value of $632.1 million, or 81% of the AFS MBS portfolio, and $155.0\nmillion in hedging instruments were used to hedge a layer of the closed portfolio of municipal loans. These derivative contracts\ninvolve the receipt of floating rate interest from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of\nthe agreement, without the exchange of the underlying notional value.\nWith respect to funding sources, we primarily utilize deposits and to a lesser extent wholesale funding to achieve our strategy of\nminimizing cost while achieving overall interest rate risk objectives as well as the liability management objectives of the\nALCO. Our primary wholesale funding sources are FHLB, brokered deposits and borrowings from the FRDW. Our FHLB\nborrowings increased 257.4%, or $547.4 million, to $760.0 million at September 30, 2024 from $212.6 million at December 31,\n2023.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our total wholesale funding as a percentage of deposits, not including brokered deposits, increased\nto 27.1% from 25.5% at December 31, 2023 and 23.3% at September 30, 2023.\nOur brokered deposits may consist of CDs and non-maturity deposits. We had $126.4 million in brokered CDs at\nSeptember 30, 2024. We had no brokered CDs at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, our brokered CDs had a\nweighted average cost of 517 basis points and remaining maturities of approximately less than 11 months. Our brokered non-\nmaturity deposits decreased to $627.2 million at September 30, 2024, of which $480.0 million are related to our cash flow\nhedges, from $828.0 million at December 31, 2023, with a weighted average cost of 345 and 323 basis points, respectively.\nOur wholesale funding policy currently allows for maximum brokered deposits of the lesser of $1.05 billion, or 12% of total\nassets. Potential higher interest expense and lack of customer loyalty are risks associated with the use of brokered deposits.\nIn connection with $790.0 million of our wholesale funds, the Bank has entered into various variable rate agreements and fixed\nor variable rate short-term pay agreements with an interest rate tied to SOFR. In connection with $790.0 million and $1.01\nbillion of the agreements outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, the Bank also entered into\nvarious interest rate swap contracts that are treated as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” that\nare expected to be effective in hedging the variability in future cash flows at 2.70% with a remaining average weighted maturity\nof 1.8 years at September 30, 2024. Refer to “Note 11 – Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities” in our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this report for a detailed description of our hedging policy and methodology\nrelated to derivative instruments.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |49\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nOur results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income\nearned on assets (loans and investments) and interest expense due on our funding sources (deposits and borrowings) during a\nparticular period. Results of operations are also affected by our noninterest income, provision for credit losses, noninterest\nexpenses and income tax expense. General economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, changes\nin interest rate yield curves, prepayment rates of MBS and loans, repricing of loan relationships, government policies and actions\nof regulatory authorities also significantly affect our results of operations. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or\ngovernment policies may also have a material impact on us.\nThe following table presents net interest income for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest income:\nLoans............................................................................................. $ 71,896 $ 64,110 $ 209,791 $ 177,570\nTaxable investment securities....................................................... 7,150 8,731 21,126 23,216\nTax-exempt investment securities................................................ 9,813 13,758 31,611 41,394\nMBS.............................................................................................. 11,976 4,426 33,179 12,585\nFHLB stock and equity investments............................................. 582 265 1,488 889\nOther interest earning assets......................................................... 4,286 1,788 15,452 5,148\nTotal interest income................................................................ 105,703 93,078 312,647 260,802\nInterest expense:\nDeposits........................................................................................ 38,532 30,951 115,196 72,536\nFHLB borrowings......................................................................... 6,488 1,174 18,893 5,347\nSubordinated notes........................................................................ 937 962 2,829 2,955\nTrust preferred subordinated debentures...................................... 1,180 1,178 3,526 3,309\nRepurchase agreements................................................................ 899 1,048 2,821 2,423\nOther borrowings.......................................................................... 2,203 4,492 6,962 13,690\nTotal interest expense.............................................................. 50,239 39,805 150,227 100,260\nNet interest income.......................................................................... $ 55,464 $ 53,273 $ 162,420 $ 160,542\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is one of the principal sources of a financial institution’s earnings stream and represents the difference or\nspread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing\nliabilities. Fluctuations in interest rates or interest rate yield curves, as well as repricing characteristics and volume and changes\nin the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, materially impact net interest income. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Federal Reserve increased the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points to 5.25% to 5.50%. During\nthe third quarter of 2024, the Federal Reserve reduced target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% to 5.00%. If the\nfederal funds rate remains elevated or increases further, it may negatively impact our net interest income.\nNet interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased $2.2 million, or 4.1%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the increases in\nthe average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases in the average rate paid on our\ninterest bearing liabilities and the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Total interest income increased $12.6\nmillion, or 13.6%, to $105.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $93.1 million during the same\nperiod in 2023. Total interest expense increased $10.4 million, or 26.2%, to $50.2 million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024, compared to $39.8 million for the same period in 2023. Our net interest margin and net interest margin (FTE), a non-\nGAAP measure, decreased to 2.82% and 2.95%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n2.85% and 3.02%, respectively, for the same period in 2023, and our net interest spread and net interest spread (FTE), also a\nnon-GAAP measure, decreased to 2.10% and 2.23%, respectively, compared to 2.14% and 2.31%, respectively, for the same\nperiod in 2023.

The increase in net interest income for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 was due to increases in the average balance and the average yield of interest earning assets, partially offset by increases\nin the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities and average balance of our interest bearing liabilities. Total interest\nincome increased $51.8 million, or 19.9%, to $312.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $260.8\nmillion for the same period in 2023.

The 11.6% decrease in noninterest income for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was due to decreases in the net gain on sale of equity\nsecurities, other noninterest income and deposit services income and a loss on sale of loans. These decreases were partially\noffset by a decrease in net loss on sale of securities AFS and an increase in brokerage services income.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold municipal securities that resulted in a net loss on sale of\nAFS securities of $1.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold equity securities that resulted in a net gain of $5.1 million.\nGain on sale of loans increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023,\ndue to an increase in the balance of loans sold. The loss on sale of loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was\ndue to the $412,000 net loss on the sale of a commercial real estate loan relationship during the first quarter of 2024.\nBrokerage services income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, due to an increase in assets under management.\nOther noninterest income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, due to an impairment loss of $868,000 for AFS securities which were sold on October 1, 2024 and a decrease\nin mortgage servicing fee income, partially offset by an increase in equity investment income. Additional decreases in other\nnoninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, include a\ndecrease in the gain recognized on the repurchase of our subordinated notes at a discount and a decrease in swap fee income.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |55\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest Expense\nWe incur certain types of noninterest expenses associated with the operation of our various business activities.

Advertising, travel and\nentertainment expense decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023,\ndue to decreases in travel related expenses, advertising, media advertising and registration fees.\nProfessional fees decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same periods in\n2023, due to decreases in legal and consulting fees.\nSoftware and data processing expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to\nthe same periods in 2023, due to new software contracts and increases in existing contract renewal costs.\nCommunications expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, driven by initial costs related to a project to improve network management efficiency.\nAmortization of intangibles decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, due primarily to a decrease in core deposit intangible amortization which is recognized on an accelerated\nmethod resulting in a decline in expense over the amortization period.\nIncome Taxes\nPre-tax income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $24.9 million and $80.9 million, respectively, an\nincrease of 15.5%, compared to $21.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a decrease of 0.8% compared\nto $81.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We recorded income tax expense of $4.4 million and $14.2\nmillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to income tax expense of $3.1 million\nand $12.2 million for the same periods in 2023. The ETR as a percentage of pre-tax income was 17.6% for both the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an ETR as a percentage of pre-tax income of 14.5% and 15.0% for the\nsame periods in 2023. The increase in the ETR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily a result\nof a decrease in net tax-exempt income as a percentage of pre-tax income as compared to the same periods in 2023. The\nincrease in income tax expense is due to the higher ETR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe same periods in 2023.\nThe ETR differs from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the effect of tax-exempt income from municipal loans and\nsecurities, as well as BOLI. The net deferred tax asset totaled $32.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $30.4 million\nat December 31, 2023. The increase in the net deferred tax asset is primarily the result of a decrease in the estimated fair value\nof the hedging derivatives.\nSee “Note 11 – Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. No valuation allowance was\nrecorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, as management believes it is more likely than not that all of the\ndeferred tax asset items will be realized in future years.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |57\nTable of Contents\nComposition of Loans\nOne of our main objectives is to seek attractive lending opportunities in Texas, primarily in the market areas in which we\noperate. Refer to “Part I – Item 1. Business – Market Area” in the 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of our primary market area\nand the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. There were no substantial changes in these\nconcentrations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The majority of our loan originations are made to borrowers\nwho live in and/or conduct business in the market areas of Texas in which we operate or adjoin, with the exception of municipal\nloans, which are made primarily throughout the state of Texas. Municipal loans are made to municipalities, counties, school\ndistricts and colleges.\nThe following table sets forth loan totals by class as of the dates presented (dollars in thousands):\nCompared to\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2023\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Change (%) Change (%)\nReal estate loans:\nConstruction............... $ 585,817 $ 789,744 $ 720,515 (25.8) % (18.7) %\n1-4 family residential. 755,406 696,738 689,492 8.4 % 9.6 %\nCommercial................ 2,422,612 2,168,451 2,117,306 11.7 % 14.4 %\nCommercial loans......... 358,854 366,893 385,816 (2.2) % (7.0) %\nMunicipal loans............. 402,041 441,168 441,512 (8.9) % (8.9) %\nLoans to individuals...... 53,318 61,516 65,992 (13.3) % (19.2) %\nTotal loans..................... $ 4,578,048 $ 4,524,510 $ 4,420,633 1.2 % 3.6 %\nOur total loan portfolio increased $53.5 million, or 1.2%, and $157.4 million, or 3.6%, at September 30, 2024 compared to\nDecember 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, with net increases in commercial real estate and 1-4 family loans,\npartially offset by decreases in construction, commercial loans, municipal loans and loans to individuals.\nAt September 30, 2024, our real estate loans represented 82.2% of our loan portfolio and were comprised of commercial real\nestate loans of 64.4%, 1-4 family residential loans of 20.0% and construction loans of 15.6%. Commercial real estate loans\nprimarily include loans collateralized by retail, commercial office buildings, multi-family residential buildings, medical\nfacilities and offices, senior living, assisted living and skilled nursing facilities, warehouse facilities, hotels and churches. Our\n1-4 family residential loans consist primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied 1-4 family residences. Our\nconstruction loans are collateralized by property located primarily in or near the market areas we serve. A number of our\nconstruction loans will be owner occupied upon completion. Construction loans for non-owner occupied projects are financed,\nbut these typically have cash flows from leases with tenants, secondary sources of repayment, and in some cases, additional\ncollateral.\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of delinquent loans 90 days or more past due, nonaccrual loans, OREO, repossessed assets and\nrestructured loans. Nonaccrual loans are loans 90 days or more delinquent and collection in full of both the principal and\ninterest is not expected. Additionally, some loans that are not delinquent or that are delinquent less than 90 days may be placed\non nonaccrual status if it is probable that we will not receive contractual principal and interest payments in accordance with the\nterms of the respective loan agreements. When a loan is categorized as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest is discontinued and\nany accrued balance is reversed for financial statement purposes. OREO represents real estate taken in full or partial\nsatisfaction of debts previously contracted. The dollar amount of OREO is based on a current evaluation of the OREO at the\ntime it is recorded on our books, net of estimated selling costs. Updated valuations are obtained as needed and any additional\nimpairments are recognized. We actively market all OREO properties and do not hold them for investment purposes.\nRestructured loans represent loans that have been modified due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulty to provide\ninterest rate reductions or below market interest rates, restructuring amortization schedules and other actions intended to\nminimize potential losses. Categorization of a loan as nonperforming is not in itself a reliable indicator of potential loan\nloss. Other factors, such as the value of collateral securing the loan and the financial condition of the borrower are considered\nin judgments as to potential loan loss.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |58\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth nonperforming assets for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nCompared to\nDecember 31, September 30,\n2023 2023\nSeptember 30, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2023 2023 Change (%) Change (%)\nNonaccrual loans .................................................... $ 7,254 $ 3,889 $ 4,316 86.5 % 68.1 %\nAccruing loans past due more than 90 days........... — — — — —\nRestructured loans (1)............................................... — 13 15 (100.0) % (100.0) %\nOREO...................................................................... 388 99 50 291.9 % 676.0 %\nRepossessed assets.................................................. 14 — — 100.0 % 100.0 %\nTotal nonperforming assets .................................... $ 7,656 $ 4,001 $ 4,381 91.4 % 74.8 %\nTotal loans............................................................... $ 4,578,048 $ 4,524,510 $ 4,420,633\nAllowance for loan losses at end of period............. 44,276 42,674 41,760\nRatio of nonaccruing loans to:\nTotal loans............................................................ 0.16 % 0.09 % 0.10 %\nRatio of nonperforming assets to:\nTotal assets........................................................... 0.09 % 0.05 % 0.05 %\nTotal loans............................................................ 0.17 % 0.09 % 0.10 %\nTotal loans and OREO......................................... 0.17 % 0.09 % 0.10 %\nRatio of allowance for loan losses to:\nNonaccruing loans................................................ 610.37 % 1,097.30 % 967.56 %\nNonperforming assets........................................... 578.32 % 1,066.58 % 953.21 %\nTotal loans............................................................ 0.97 % 0.94 % 0.94 %\nNet charge-offs to average loans outstanding......... 0.03 % 0.06 % 0.05 %\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Loans\nIn accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses on loans is estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan\nbased on expected credit losses. The CECL model uses historical experience and current conditions for homogeneous pools of\nloans, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about future events. The impact of varying economic conditions and portfolio\nstress factors are a component of the credit loss models applied to each portfolio. Reserve factors are specific to the loan\nsegments that share similar risk characteristics based on the probability of default assumptions and loss given default\nassumptions, over the contractual term. The forecasted periods gradually mean-revert the economic inputs to their long-run\nhistorical trends. Management evaluates the economic data points used in the Moody’s forecasting scenarios on a quarterly\nbasis to determine the most appropriate impact to the various portfolio characteristics based on management’s view and applies\nweighting to various forecasting scenarios as deemed appropriate based on known and expected economic activities.\nManagement also considers and may apply relevant qualitative factors, not previously considered, to determine the appropriate\nallowance level. The use of the CECL model includes significant judgment by management and may differ from those of our\npeers due to different historical loss patterns, economic forecasts, and the length of time of the reasonable and supportable\nforecast period and reversion period.\nWe utilize Moody’s Analytics economic forecast scenarios and assign probability weighting to those scenarios which best\nreflect management’s views on the economic forecast. The probability weighting and scenarios utilized for the estimate of the\nallowance were generally reflective of continued economic and repricing uncertainty forecasted in our CECL model as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nWhen determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses on our loan portfolio, our commercial construction and real estate\nloans, commercial loans and municipal loans utilize the probability of default/loss given default discounted cash flow approach.\nReserves on these loans are based upon risk factors including the loan type and structure, collateral type, leverage ratio,\nrefinancing risk and origination quality, among others. Our consumer construction real estate loans, 1-4 family residential loans\nand our loans to individuals use a loss rate based upon risk factors including loan types, origination year and credit scores.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |59\nTable of Contents\nLoans evaluated collectively in a pool are monitored to ensure they continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics with other\nloans in the pool. If a loan does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans, expected credit losses for that loan are\nevaluated individually.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our review of the loan portfolio indicated that an allowance for loan losses of $44.3 million was\nappropriate to cover expected losses in the portfolio. Changes in economic and other conditions, including the application of\nthe CECL model may require future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the allowance for loan losses increased $1.6 million, or 3.8%, to $44.3\nmillion, or 0.97% of total loans, when compared to $42.7 million, or 0.94% of total loans at December 31, 2023.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, loan charge-offs were $773,000 and $2.1 million, respectively, and\nrecoveries were $365,000 and $1.2 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, loan\ncharge-offs were $1.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and recoveries were $378,000 and $1.2 million, respectively. For\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for credit losses for loans of $2.3 million and\n$2.6 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for credit losses\nfor loans of $6.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Off-Balance-Sheet Credit Exposures\nAllowance for off-balance-sheet credit exposures were as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period.............................................. $ 3,208 $ 3,207 $ 3,932 $ 3,687\nProvision for (reversal of) off-balance-sheet credit\nexposures............................................................................... 112 646 (612) 166\nBalance at end of period........................................................ $ 3,320 $ 3,853 $ 3,320 $ 3,853\nOur off-balance-sheet credit exposures include contractual commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. For\nthese credit exposures we evaluate the expected credit losses using usage given defaults and credit conversion factors depending\non the type of commitment and based upon historical usage rates. These assumptions are reevaluated on an annual basis and\nadjusted if necessary. For additional information regarding our methodology used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on\noff-balance-sheet credit exposures, see “Note 12 – Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements, Commitments and Contingencies” to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in this report.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |60\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024 increased 4.1%, or $32.0 million, to $805.3 million, or 9.6% of total\nassets, compared to $773.3 million, or 9.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders’ equity was the\nresult of net income of $66.7 million, stock compensation expense of $2.5 million, net issuance of common stock under\nemployee stock plans of $1.1 million and common stock issued under our dividend reinvestment plan of $886,000, partially\noffset by cash dividends paid of $32.7 million, other comprehensive loss of $5.0 million and repurchases of $1.5 million of our\ncommon stock.\nThe Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock and related paid-in capital, net of treasury stock, and\nretained earnings. The Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock and related paid-in capital, and retained\nearnings. In connection with the adoption of the Basel III Capital Rules, we elected to opt-out of the requirement to include\naccumulated other comprehensive income in Common Equity Tier 1. We also elected, for a five-year transitional period, the\neffects of credit loss accounting under CECL from Common Equity Tier 1, as further discussed below. Common Equity Tier 1\nfor both the Company and the Bank is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities.\nTier 1 capital includes Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. For the Company, additional Tier 1 capital\nat September 30, 2024 included $58.5 million of trust preferred securities. For bank holding companies that had assets of less\nthan $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 can be treated as Tier 1 capital\nto the extent that they do not exceed 25% of Tier 1 capital after the application of capital deductions and adjustments. The Bank\ndid not have any additional Tier 1 capital beyond Common Equity Tier 1 at September 30, 2024.\nTotal capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital for both the Company and the Bank includes a permissible\nportion of the allowance for credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Tier 2 capital for the Company also includes\n$92.0 million of qualified subordinated debt as of September 30, 2024. The permissible portion of qualified subordinated notes\ndecreases 20% per year during the final five years of the term of the notes.\nIn April 2020, the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued supplemental instructions\nallowing banking organizations that implement CECL before the end of 2020, the option to delay for two years an estimate of\nthe CECL methodologies’ effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodologies effect on capital, followed by\na three-year transition period. We elected to adopt the five-year transition option. In accordance with CECL guidance, a CECL\ntransitional amount totaling $2.0 million has been added back to CET1 as of September 30, 2024, representing 25% of the $8.2\nmillion transitional amount at December 31, 2023.\nManagement believes that, as of September 30, 2024, we met all capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. It is\nmanagement’s intention to maintain our capital at a level acceptable to all regulatory authorities and future dividend payments\nwill be determined accordingly. Regulatory authorities require that any dividend payments made by either us or the Bank not\nexceed earnings for that year. Accordingly, shareholders should not anticipate a continuation of the cash dividend payments\nsimply because of the existence of a dividend reinvestment program. The payment of dividends will depend upon future\nearnings, our financial condition and other related factors including the discretion of the Board.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |61\nTable of Contents\nTo be categorized as well capitalized we must maintain minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Total\ncapital risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Actions\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nSeptember 30, 2024 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Amount\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 726,042 13.07 % $ 250,013 4.50 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 865,473 15.58 % $ 249,955 4.50 % $ 361,045 6.50 %\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 784,504 14.12 % $ 333,350 6.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 865,473 15.58 % $ 333,273 6.00 % $ 444,364 8.00 %\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 921,534 16.59 % $ 444,467 8.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 910,497 16.39 % $ 444,364 8.00 % $ 555,455 10.00 %\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) (1)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 784,504 9.61 % $ 326,580 4.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 865,473 10.60 % $ 326,487 4.00 % $ 408,109 5.00 %\nTo Be Well Capitalized\nUnder Prompt\nFor Capital Corrective Actions\nActual Adequacy Purposes Provisions\nDecember 31, 2023 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nCommon Equity Tier 1 (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 690,296 12.28 % $ 252,954 4.50 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 836,228 14.88 % $ 252,865 4.50 % $ 365,249 6.50 %\nTier 1 Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 748,755 13.32 % $ 337,273 6.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 836,228 14.88 % $ 337,153 6.00 % $ 449,537 8.00 %\nTotal Capital (to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 884,095 15.73 % $ 449,697 8.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 877,691 15.62 % $ 449,537 8.00 % $ 561,922 10.00 %\nTier 1 Capital (to Average Assets) (1)\nConsolidated............................................................ $ 748,755 9.39 % $ 318,906 4.00 % N/A N/A\nBank Only................................................................ $ 836,228 10.49 % $ 318,814 4.00 % $ 398,517 5.00 %\n(1) Refers to quarterly average assets as calculated in accordance with policies established by bank regulatory agencies.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Southside Bancshares and Southside Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III\nCapital Rules.

This means addressing (1) the immediate cash withdrawal\nrequirements of depositors and other fund providers; (2) the funding requirements of lines and letters of credit; and (3) the\nshort-term credit needs of customers. Liquidity is provided by cash, interest earning deposits and short-term investments that\ncan be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss. At September 30, 2024, these investments were 10.8% of total assets, as\ncompared with 8.9% for December 31, 2023 and 6.3% for September 30, 2023. The increase to 10.8% at September 30, 2024\nas compared to December 31, 2023, is reflective of an increase in the short-term investment portfolio, partially offset by a\ndecrease in interest earning deposits and an increase in total assets. The increase at September 30, 2024 as compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023, is reflective of increases in interest earning deposits, the short-term investment portfolio and to a lesser\nextent, cash and due from banks, partially offset by an increase in total assets. Liquidity is further provided through the\nmatching, by time period, of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities. The Bank has\nthree unsecured lines of credit for the purchase of overnight federal funds at prevailing rates with Frost Bank, Amegy Bank and\nTIB – The Independent Bankers Bank for $40.0 million, $25.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. There were no federal\nfunds purchased at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. To provide more liquidity in response to economic conditions\nin recent years, the Federal Reserve has encouraged broader use of the discount window. At September 30, 2024, the amount\nof additional funding the Bank could obtain from the FRDW, collateralized by securities, was approximately $352.6 million.\nThere were $25.0 million of borrowings from the FRDW at September 30, 2024, and $300.0 million at December 31, 2023. To\nprovide more stability and to assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all of their depositors, the Federal Reserve\ncreated the BTFP in the first quarter of 2023. On March 11, 2024, the Federal Reserve stopped extending new BTFP advances.\nThere were no remaining borrowings from the BTFP at September 30, 2024 compared to $117.7 million at December 31, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, the amount of additional funding the Bank could obtain from FHLB, collateralized by securities, FHLB\nstock and nonspecified loans and securities, was approximately $1.80 billion, net of FHLB stock purchases required. The Bank\nhas a $5.0 million line of credit with Frost Bank to be used to issue letters of credit, and at September 30, 2024, the line had one\noutstanding letter of credit for $155,000. The Bank currently has has one outstanding letter of credit from FHLB held as\ncollateral for its public fund deposits for $6.1 million.\nInterest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net\ninterest income through periods of changing interest rates. The ALCO closely monitors various liquidity ratios and interest rate\nspreads and margins. The ALCO utilizes a simulation model to perform interest rate simulation tests that apply various interest\nrate scenarios including immediate shocks and MVPE to assist in determining our overall interest rate risk and the adequacy of\nour liquidity position. In addition, the ALCO utilizes this simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income of\nvarious interest rate scenarios. By utilizing this technology, we can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and\nliability mix to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |63\nTable of Contents\nManagement continually evaluates our liquidity position and currently believes the Company has adequate funding to meet our\nfinancial needs.\nExpansion\nOn September 3, 2024, we opened a loan production office in The Woodlands, in the Greater North Houston area.\nBranch Closures\nIn April 2024, we announced our plan to close a retail grocery store branch location in Kingwood on November 2, 2024.\nOn May 3, 2024, we closed a traditional branch location in Jasper due to close proximity to another Southside branch.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements included in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” included in “Item 2.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report and other cautionary\nstatements set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRefer to the discussion of market risks included in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in\nthe 2023 Form 10-K.\nIn the banking industry, a major risk exposure is changing interest rates. The primary objective of monitoring our interest rate\nsensitivity, or risk, is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in\nnet interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates. Federal Reserve monetary control efforts,\nthe effects of deregulation, economic uncertainty and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of\nmanaging interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years.\nIn an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates, management closely monitors our exposure to interest rate\nrisk through our ALCO. Our ALCO meets regularly and reviews our interest rate risk position and makes recommendations to\nour board for adjusting this position. In addition, our board regularly reviews our asset/liability position. We primarily use two\nmethods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk: net income simulation analysis and MVPE modeling. We utilize the net\nincome simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing\nmarket rates. This model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net\nincome over the next 12 months. The model is used to measure the impact on net interest income relative to a base case\nscenario of rates immediately increasing 100 and 200 basis points or decreasing 50, 100 and 200 basis points over the next 12\nmonths. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the repricing and\nmaturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet. The impact of interest rate-related risks such as\nprepayment, basis and option risk are also considered. The model has interest rate floors and no interest rates are assumed to go\nnegative. We continue to monitor interest rates and anticipate rate changes during the remainder of 2024.\nThe following table reflects the noted increases and decreases in interest rates under the model simulations and the anticipated\nimpact on net interest income relative to the base case over the next 12 months for the periods presented.\nAnticipated impact over the\nnext 12 months\nSeptember 30,\nRate projections: 2024 2023\nIncrease:\n100 basis points....................................................................................................................... 4.49 % 3.14 %\n200 basis points....................................................................................................................... 7.41 % 6.53 %\nDecrease:\n50 basis points.........................................................................................................................

(3.34) % (4.71) %\n200 basis points....................................................................................................................... (3.62) % (9.60) %\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. |64\nTable of Contents\nAs part of the overall assumptions, certain assets and liabilities are given reasonable floors. This type of simulation analysis\nrequires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix, prepayment rates on mortgage-\nrelated assets and fixed rate loans, cash flows and repricing of all financial instruments, changes in volumes and pricing, future\nshapes of the yield curve, relationship of market interest rates to each other (basis risk), credit spread and deposit\nsensitivity. Assumptions are based on management’s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain\nchanges in interest rates.\nEconomic conditions and growth prospects are currently impacted by record inflation, continued higher interest rates and\npotential recessionary concerns. Furthermore, worker shortages and inflationary conditions have had some impact on the level\nof economic growth in our market areas. Ongoing inflation levels and higher interest rates could have a negative impact on the\nfinancial condition of both our consumer and commercial borrowers.\nThe ALCO monitors various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for us. Management continually\nevaluates the condition of the economy, the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of\ninvestments that should be made and at what maturities. Using this analysis, management from time to time assumes calculated\ninterest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of\ninterest rates. Regulatory authorities also monitor our gap position along with other liquidity ratios. In addition, as described\nabove, we utilize a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate\nscenarios. By utilizing this model, we can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to mitigate\nthe change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios.\nITEM 4.

Welcome to Southside Bancshares third-quarter 2024 earnings call. (Operator\nInstructions). Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would like now to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Lindsey Bailes, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go\nahead.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLindsey Bailes Southside Bancshares Inc - VP, Investor Relations\nThank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to southside Bancshares' third-quarter 2024 earnings call. A transcript\nof today's call will be posted on southside.com under Investor Relations.\nDuring today's call and in other disclosures and presentations, I will remind you that any forward-looking statements are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties.

Good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $20.5 million, earnings per\nshare of $0.68, a return on average tangible common equity of 13.69% and continued strong asset quality metrics.\nLinked quarter, our net interest income increased $1.86 million, and our net interest margin increased 8 basis points to 2.95%.\nDuring the quarter, we sold approximately $28 million of lower-yielding AFS municipal securities, unwound the related fair value\nswaps and recorded a loss of $1.9 million. We reinvested the proceeds in higher-yielding agency mortgage-backed securities.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

Recent\ninvestments made in our wealth management and trust department are paying dividends as reflected by the steady growth in new\nclients and quarterly fee income. We anticipate this trend will continue. Linked quarter loans decreased slightly as we experienced a\nfew large payoffs at the end of the quarter. Our loan pipeline remains solid. However, headwinds of anticipated additional loan\npayoffs have caused us to reduce our target loan growth for 2024 from 5% to 3%. Our initiative to expand C&I lending in our\nmetropolitan markets is progressing as we are hiring additional relationship managers, and we expect to begin seeing results in\n2025. The markets we serve remain healthy and continue to grow and perform well. I look forward to answering your questions\nfollowing Julie's remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJulie Shamburger Southside Bancshares Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call. We reported third quarter net income of $20.5\nmillion, a decrease of $4.1 million or 16.8% on a linked-quarter basis and diluted earnings per share of $0.68, a decrease of 16%\nlinked quarter. Loans decreased slightly to $4.58 billion, down from $4.59 billion at June 30. Our annualized year-to-date loan growth\nwas 1.6%. The linked quarter decrease was driven by decreases of $50.2 million in commercial real estate loans and $14.9 million in\nmunicipal loans, partially offset by increases of $39.8 million in construction loans and $17.4 million in 1-4 family residential loans.\nThe decrease in commercial real estate was primarily a result of a few large payoffs in the third quarter.\nThe average interest rate of loans funded during the quarter was approximately 8.1%. As of September 30, our loans with oil and\ngas industry exposure were $116.1 million or 2.5% of total loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million for the linked\nquarter to $47.6 million. Asset quality metrics remained strong. Nonperforming assets remained at low levels with nonperforming\nassets of $7.7 million or 0.09% of total assets at September 30 and a slight increase from 0.08% at June 30.\nOn September 30, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.97% and compared to 0.92% on June 30. The\nincrease in the allowance as a percentage of total loans was primarily due to the increased economic concerns forecasted in the\nCECL model specific to office and multifamily markets in metro areas.\nOur securities portfolio was $2.70 billion at September 30, a slight decrease from $2.71 billion last quarter. As Lee mentioned, during\nthe third quarter, we sold approximately $28 million of lower coupon AFS municipal securities and replaced them with higher-yielding\nagency mortgage-backed securities. In connection with the sale of these securities, we unwound their related fair value swaps,\nwhich resulted in a net loss in the third quarter of $1.9 million. In addition, we recorded an impairment loss of $868,000 in other\nnoninterest income on the sale of AFS municipal securities and the unwind of the related fair value hedges sold subsequent to\nquarter end.\nThere were no transfers of AFS securities during the third quarter. As of September 30, we had a net unrealized loss in the AFS\nsecurities portfolio of $24.7 million, a decrease of $23.6 million compared to $48.3 million last quarter.\nAt September 30, the unrealized gain on the fair value hedges on municipal and mortgage-backed securities was approximately\n$3.5 million compared to $18.6 million linked quarter. This unrealized gain partially offset the unrealized losses in the AFS securities\nportfolio. Our AOCI on September 30, 2024, was a net loss of $118.5 million compared to a net loss of $111 million on June 30,\n2024.\nThe net loss was comprised of net losses on our securities and swap derivatives of $99.3 million and $19.2 million related to our\nretirement plans.\nAs of September 30, the duration in the total securities portfolio was 8.3 years and the duration of the AFS portfolio was 5.9 years, a\ndecrease from 8.9 years and 6.7 years, respectively, at June 30. At quarter end, our mix of loans and securities was 63% and 37%,\nrespectively, with no change in the mix from last quarter.\nDeposits decreased $60.2 million or 0.9% on a linked quarter basis. The decrease was primarily driven by a commercial account\nthat increases during the second quarter each year and exits the third quarter, offset by increases in other funding sources, such as\nbrokered deposits of $71.9 million.\nOur capital ratios remained strong with all capital ratios well above the capital adequacy and well-capitalized threshold. Liquidity\nresources remained solid with $2.23 billion in liquidity lines available as of September 30. We did not purchase any shares of our\ncommon stock during the third quarter or subsequent to September 30. However, we have approximately 583,000 shares remaining\nin the current repurchase authorization. Our tax equivalent net interest margin increased 8 basis points on a linked quarter basis to\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

The tax equivalent net interest spread increased from the same period by 10 basis points to 2.23% up from\n2.13%.\nFor the three months ended September 30, we experienced an increase in net interest income of $1.9 million or 3.5% compared to\nthe linked quarter. Noninterest income, excluding the net loss on the sales of AFS securities decreased $2 million or 16.7% for the\nlinked quarter. Primarily due to the impairment loss of $868,000 recorded on AFS securities in the third quarter and the decrease in\nBOLI income due to debt benefits received in the second quarter.\nNoninterest expense increased $567,000 or 1.6% on a linked-quarter basis to $36.3 million, driven primarily by an increase in\nsalaries and employee benefits and other noninterest expense. We are expecting noninterest expense of $37 million for the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\nOur fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio decreased to 51.90% as of September 30, and from 52.71% as of June 30. We recorded\nincome tax expense of $4.4 million, a decrease of $822,000 compared to the second quarter. The decrease in tax expense was\ndriven by the decrease in pretax income. Our effective tax rate increased slightly to 17.6% for the third quarter from 17.4% in the\nprevious quarter. We currently estimate an annual effective tax rate of 17.6% for 2024.\nThank you for joining us today. This concludes our comments, and we will open the line for your questions.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Brett Rabatin, Hovde.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBrett Rabatin Hovde Group LLC - Analyst\nI wanted to start with the securities portfolio actions and the hedge. Can you guys like -- I guess, first, can you talk about there were\nlower-yielding securities? Can you talk about what you what the yield was on what you sold and what you purchased? And then\nmaybe if you've done it, just the net effect to the margin on a go-forward basis would be helpful.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nThe net effect on the margin will be positive. It probably about 1 or 2 basis points. But with the small amount of securities we dealt\nwith it's not going to move the margin materially. But basically, we had some fair value hedges on some of these municipal securities\nso those are the ones that we unwound, and we primarily bought premium mortgage-backed securities with shorter duration, higher\nyields, but not at too big of a premium so that if rates then decline, which obviously they haven't over the last two or three weeks, the\nprepayments wouldn't impact the yield too much. So hopefully, that gives you some color on it.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBrett Rabatin Hovde Group LLC - Analyst\nYes, that's helpful, Lee. I didn't think it was going to be a big number, but I just want to make sure I know the detail there. I wanted to\nalso ask a lot of banks are struggling with payoffs wanted just to hear payoff activity in the quarter and then just what the loan\npipeline looks like and what that might suggest maybe for loan growth going forward?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nI mean I view loan payoffs two ways: one, I'd like to see the balances; but two, it's a sign of a good economy because these are\nprojects that are being sold out there. But we are beginning to see some of our construction projects that have reached stabilization\nor close that are beginning to pay off.\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

We did have a large loan that we have put on\nthe books in early October that would have offset this, and we would have shown an increase in loans. But the two didn't match up.\nAnd so we had these two large payoffs that caused us to have that slight decrease.\nOur loan pipeline looks good. It's just we expect some additional payoffs in the fourth quarter. And there's just not enough time to\nmake up the difference to get to 5% loan growth for the year. So that's why we're lowering at 3%. But we have experienced some\ngood loan growth in October, but we also do expect some additional payoffs.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBrett Rabatin Hovde Group LLC - Analyst\nOkay. That's helpful. And then if I could sneak in one last one, just around the margin from here. Any thoughts, Julie, on the margin\ngoing forward?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nI think going forward, it will be a little bumpy, Brett, from the standpoint of during the third quarter. We have this large deposit\naccount that builds up, and it reaches pretty close to maximum by the end of June. But if it's not there, it gets real quick in July. And\nit's one that we have every year that builds up during June, pretty much reached the peak during July and then pays off usually in\nearly August and it was at a lower rate than the wholesale funding. So that helped our margin some during the third quarter.\nWe obviously won't have that again in the fourth quarter. So that's why I'm saying it's a little bumpy. And then it really just depends\nhow fast, if at all, the Fed continues to -- or whether they continue to lower short-term rates. What will happen with the margin\nmoving forward. But that's why I'm saying it would be a little bumpy because we won't have that occurring again in the fourth quarter.\nAnd then that balance, I think, got to and Suni you can tell me, I think you got to around $175 million, yes.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJulie Shamburger Southside Bancshares Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nIt was $122 million at June 30.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nYes and it quickly got there during ramped up in early July. So that was a positive for us in terms of our NIM, but -- and we won't\nhave that again. But we also had some other positive things related to the NIM.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nWood Lay, KBW.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWood Lay Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc - Analyst\nI wanted to start on the C&I initiative. Just any update on how the build-out is going? And how many hires were made in the quarter?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nWe had two hires during the quarter. We're looking for some additional lenders and are interviewing people right now. So we expect\nto hire at least a couple of more, and they're hitting the ground running, and it's moving along as we didn't expect to hire everybody\nat once, because we're looking for certain type of people. And that's why I say that we should begin to see results during 2025\nassociated with this. And we'll continue to hire during 2025 as well.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

All right. That's helpful. Maybe shifting over to deposit costs. It was great to see total deposit costs ticked down in the quarter.\nWe got the 50 basis point cut near the end. Could you just walk us through how deposit pricing trends when sort of pre and post cut?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nPost cut, we were able to -- we have probably close to $1 billion that we were able to cut the rates pretty close to what the Fed did,\nmaybe not exactly the full amount, but at least probably 80% of what they did. And some of that takes 30 days to take effect, but we\nwere able to do that. We also have a little over $50 million a month in CDs that are maturing. And those rates, we were able to cut\npretty much by the full 50 basis points. And then with the forward outlook at that time, being that they were going to be aggressive\nrate cuts moving forward, we were able to cut some of the longer ones.\nWe've since increased those a little bit, but still overall, we're going to be seeing those move down in general, probably 40 basis\npoints every month. So those are the primary things. And then on our wholesale funding, all that unless it's swap will move down as\nwell.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nWood Lay Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc - Analyst\nYes. So if I look at the ALCO models you all show up as asset sensitive, but obviously, those are assumption heavy. And it sounds\nlike you're making pretty good progress on the deposit cost side. I mean is asset sensitive still the right way to think about you guys?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nYes. I think so because we've got -- we've got about $1.7 billion, I think, in loans that reprice probably within 2 to 3 months. So it's --\nthere's more on that side right now. But ultimately, and that's why I say it really just depends what the Fed action is going forward,\nhow much more cut there is. But I would consider us to some extent, asset sensitive at this point in time in terms of a quarterly move\nand what we're able to do now over a 6- to 9-month period, I think we go back pretty much even.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Matt Olney, Stephens.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatt Olney Stephens Inc - Analyst\nJust want to ask more about M&A -- just ask more about M&A in your Texas market. Just appreciate your color on kind of the M&A\nchatter and kind of what you're hearing from other banks in the marketplace.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nWith bank stocks up from probably three to six months ago. The chatter has picked up some. I think a lot of people are looking to\nsee what happens with the election in terms of additional regulation. But I am hearing carry more chatter around M&A right now and\nreally expect in 2025, we'll probably see more activity here in Texas than we've seen this year. I know of a few banks that are for\nsale, but nothing at this point that we're interested in.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatt Olney Stephens Inc - Analyst\nMaybe just following up there. Just remind us of your target profile bank that at this point you're looking for?\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

At $1.2 billion, we'd be able to stand at the $10 billion and then go look\nfor something in that $2 billion to $4 billion range.\nBut that really would be the target range in terms of dollar amount, in terms of geography, I think we've consistently said that we'd\nlike to stay along I-35 to the East. We'd be willing to go out probably 75 miles or so to the west. But just following that I-35 line down\nthrough Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio and pretty much to the east.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nMatt Olney Stephens Inc - Analyst\nOkay. And then I also want to shift gears over to the expenses. I think you gave us some good guidance for the fourth quarter. Just\ntrying to feel out next year and just thinking more about kind of the puts and takes. You've got this C&I initiative that we've talked\nabout seeing some good movements there this past quarter and expect to have some more hires into fourth quarter and into next\nyear. Is it fair to assume that expense growth kind of year-over-year in could be a little bit higher than what we're going to see in '24\nas far as the year-over-year growth just from that C&I initiative? Or are there other puts and takes to consider.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nJulie Shamburger Southside Bancshares Inc - Chief Financial Officer\nI mean, if you compare to what we've seen in 2024, I think there will be some increase it will happen in salaries more than likely --\nwe've talked a little bit about 2025 salaries and kind of increases overall. And then the C&I initiative will add some. And then\nprobably the software and data processing will - we did not -- we have not seen it go up as much this year as we had first thought in\nour budget. But I suspect in 2025, we will get closer to that to a higher level in that category for sure.\nSo I think it's fair to -- I mean, I know I believe I projected or forecasted around $37 million or maybe even higher than that very early\nin the year. And then we brought it down there some cost initiatives that we did in Q1. And -- but I think $37 million -- I mean, we\nhaven't finished the budgeting process for certain yet. But I think closer to $37 million or more -- a little more next year, it's probably\nappropriate at this point. And certainly, in the next quarter, I'll be able to give you something finer tuned.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nI show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lee Gibson, CEO, for the closing remarks.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nLee Gibson Southside Bancshares Inc - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nThank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Southside Bancshares along with the opportunity to\nanswer your questions. In closing, we're looking forward to our prospects for the remainder of the year. and reporting year-end and\nfourth quarter results to you during our next earnings call in January. This now concludes our call.\nThank you very much.\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.
