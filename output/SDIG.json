(NASDAQ: SDIG) (“Stronghold”, the “Company”, or “we”)** today announced the following:\n\n**Recent Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Revenues of $11.2 million, down 42% sequentially and 37% year-over-year.** Revenues comprised $10.6 million from cryptocurrency operations and $0.5 million from the sale of energy.\n  * **GAAP Net Loss of $22.7 million and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Loss of $5.5 million.**\n\n\n\n**Merger Agreement with Bitfarms**\n\nOn August 21, 2024, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Bitfarms Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act and continued under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (“Bitfarms”) and certain affiliates of Bitfarms. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Stronghold shareholders will receive 2.52 common shares of Bitfarms for each share of Stronghold common stock that they own. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the receipt of Stronghold shareholder approval, applicable regulatory approvals, certain third-party consents and other customary closing conditions.\n\n**Bitfarms Hosting Agreements**\n\nOn September 12, 2024, Stronghold Digital Mining Hosting, LLC (“Stronghold Hosting”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company entered into a Hosting Agreement (the “First Hosting Agreement”) with Bitfarms, pursuant to which Stronghold Hosting will host 10,000 Bitmain T21 Bitcoin miners owned by Bitfarms (the “Bitfarms Miners”) at the Company’s Panther Creek site. The Company has received a portion of the Bitfarms Miners to date and expects to receive the remaining Bitfarms Miners during November and December 2024. The First Hosting Agreement has an initial term expiring on December 31, 2025, after which it will automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal. Pursuant to the First Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms will pay Stronghold fifty percent of the profit generated by the Bitfarms miners, subject to certain monthly adjustments. In connection with the execution of the First Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms also deposited with Stronghold $7.8 million, equal to the estimated cost of power for three months of operations of the Bitfarms Miners, which will be refundable in full to Bitfarms within one business day of the end of the initial term expiring on December 31, 2025.\n\nOn October 29, 2024, Stronghold Hosting entered into another Hosting Agreement (the “Second Hosting Agreement”) with Bitfarms, pursuant to which Stronghold Hosting will host 10,000 Bitmain T21 miners owned by Bitfarms (the “Second Bitfarms Miners”) at the Company’s Scrubgrass site. The Company expects to begin receiving the Second Bitfarms Miners in late December 2024, or early January 2025. The initial term of the Second Hosting Agreement will expire on December 31, 2025, after which it will automatically renew for additional one-year periods unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal. Pursuant to the Second Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms will pay Stronghold fifty percent of the profit generated by the Second Bitfarms Miners, subject to certain monthly adjustments. In connection with the execution of the Second Hosting Agreement, Bitfarms also deposited with Stronghold $7.8 million, equal to the estimated cost of power for three months of operations of the Second Bitfarms Miners, which will be refundable in full to Bitfarms at the end of the initial term.\n\n**Bitcoin Mining Update**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Stronghold generated 188 Bitcoin, and approximately $0.5 million of energy revenues, which represented the equivalent of 8 Bitcoin at the average price of Bitcoin during the period, for a total of 196 Bitcoin equivalents. This represents an approximately 35% decrease versus the Bitcoin-equivalent production during the second quarter of 2024, which was primarily a result of the Bitcoin halving that occurred on April 19, 2024, that caused a reduction in the block subsidy from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 Bitcoin.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, and November 8, 2024, the Company had approximately $5.1 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and Bitcoin on our balance sheet, which included 10 Bitcoin and 4 Bitcoin, respectively. Additionally, Stronghold has approximately $2.6 million of contracted receivables that it expects to receive in the next 30 days related to the sale of its 2023 waste coal tax credits. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had principal amount of outstanding indebtedness of approximately $53.7 million and approximately $3.4 million of capacity remaining under its at-the-market offering agreement (the “ATM”) with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC. The Company has not sold any of its shares under the ATM during 2024.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nStronghold will host a conference call today, November 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these results. To participate, a live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations page of the Company’s website at [ir.strongholddigitalmining.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=o5HW7spo9tKWMFdX6Ni1PlxPmKhT9RdwXaf6CpQmUaenSCqODhanieQBBzBPRrpsGf_WQK5_mv6kkLrWqE272Kp9-vZ87P6TNWcHoPEzEcyNdQEXQfm02nRxbLUydNWl).

related earnings call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, as a measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by the removal of one-time transaction costs, non-recurring expenses, realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, expenses related to stock-based compensation, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, or changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities in the period presented. See reconciliation below.\n\nOur board of directors and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because they believe it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation, amortization, impairments, and realized gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets) and other items (such as one-time transaction costs, expenses related to stock-based compensation, and gains and losses on derivative contracts) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should be read in conjunction with the financial statements furnished in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, expected to be filed on or around November 13, 2024. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\n\n**STRONGHOLD DIGITAL MINING, INC.****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n** _(in thousands)_**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \nNet Loss—GAAP| $| (22,671| )| $| (22,312| )| $| (38,095| )| $| (80,665| )  \n**Plus** :  \nInterest expense| 2,237| 2,441| 6,748| 7,429  \nDepreciation and amortization| 8,624| 9,667| 27,429| 26,025  \nLoss on debt extinguishment| —| —| —| 28,961  \nImpairments on equipment deposits| —| 5,422| —| 5,422  \nNon-recurring expenses 1| 928| 1,216| 7,384| 1,853  \nStock-based compensation| 1,486| 788| 5,093| 7,604  \nLoss on disposal of fixed assets| 458| —| 2,189| 108  \nRealized loss on sale of miner assets| 530| —| 494| —  \nChanges in fair value of warrant liabilities| 2,850| 181| (8,445| )| (5,580| )  \nAccretion of asset retirement obligation| 14| 13| 41| 39  \n**Adjusted EBITDA—Non-GAAP****2**| **$**| **(5,544**| **)**| **$**| **(2,583**| **)**| **$**| **2,838**| **$**| **(8,804**| **)**  \n  \n_1_ _Includes the following non-recurring expenses: estimated accrual for two loss contingencies, one-time legal fees, and other one-time items.__2_ _As previously disclosed, the Company adopted ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024, using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment of approximately $0.1 million recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.
