With our resources prioritized to the things that matter most, I believe that these changes will result in a bigger and better Krispy Kreme,” Charlesworth continued. \n\n**_Financial Highlights_ ** |  **Quarter Ended**  \n---|---  \n_$ in millions, except per share data_ |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **Change**  \n**GAAP:**  \n**Net revenue** |  **$** |  **379.9** |  **$** |  **407.4** |  **(6.8** |  **)%**  \n**Operating loss** |  **$** |  **(16.0** |  **)** |  **$** |  **(2.1** |  **)** |  **nm**  \n**Operating loss margin** |  **(4.2** |  **)%** |  **(0.5** |  **)%** |  **(370) bps**  \n**Net income/(loss)** |  **$** |  **37.6** |  **$** |  **(40.3** |  **)** |  **nm**  \n**Net income/(loss) attributable to KKI** |  **$** |  **39.6** |  **$** |  **(40.5** |  **)** |  **nm**  \n**Diluted income/(loss) per share** |  **$** |  **0.23** |  **$** |  **(0.24** |  **)** |  **$** |  **0.47**  \n**Non-GAAP(1) : **  \n**Organic revenue** |  **$** |  **376.4** |  **$** |  **363.8** |  **3.5** |  **%**  \n**Adjusted net (loss)/income, diluted** |  **$** |  **(2.5** |  **)** |  **$** |  **4.4** |  **nm**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **34.7** |  **$** |  **43.7** |  **(20.7** |  **)%**  \n**Adjusted EBITDA margin** |  **9.1** |  **%** |  **10.7** |  **%** |  **(160) bps**  \n**Adjusted diluted (loss)/income per share** |  **$** |  **(0.01** |  **)** |  **$** |  **0.03** |  **$** |  **(0.04** |  **)**  \n  \n**_Notes:_ **  \n---  \n**(1) ** |  **_Non-GAAP figures – please refer to Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures._ **  \n  \n**_Key Operating Metrics_ ** |  **Quarter Ended**  \n---|---  \n**_$ in millions_ ** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **Change**  \n**Global Points of Access** |  **15,811** |  **13,394** |  **18.0** |  **%**  \n**Sales per Hub (U.S.) TTM** |  **$** |  **4.9** |  **$** |  **4.8** |  **2.1** |  **%**  \n**Sales per Hub (International) TTM** |  **$** |  **10.1** |  **$** |  **9.9** |  **2.0** |  **%**  \n**Digital Sales as a Percent of Doughnut Shop Sales** |  **15.5** |  **%** |  **12.6** |  **%** |  **290 bps**  \n  \n** Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results _(vs Q3 2023)_ **\n\nKrispy Kreme’s third-quarter results reflect the sale of a majority ownership stake of Insomnia Cookies. The business is now fully focused on its core strategy of producing, selling and distributing fresh doughnuts daily and executing on its profitable U.S. growth strategy and capital light international model. Net revenue was $379.9 million in Q3 2024, a decline of 6.8%, compared to $407.4 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP Net Income was $37.6 million, including the gain on divestiture of a controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies, compared to prior year net loss of $40.3 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.23, compared to a loss of $0.24 in the same quarter last year. \n\nTotal company organic revenue grew 3.5% compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Delivered Fresh Daily (“DFD”) sales and digital sales both grew 15%, more than offsetting expected consumer softness in U.S. Retail and the U.K. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $34.7 million, a decline of 20.7% largely driven by the sale of a majority ownership stake in Insomnia Cookies. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 160 bps to 9.1%, due to underperformance in the U.K. and incremental vehicle accident claims costs in the U.S. Adjusted Net Loss, diluted was $2.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted Diluted EPS declined to $(0.01) from $0.03 in the same quarter last year. \n\n** Third Quarter 2024 Segment Results ( _vs Q3 2023)_ **\n\n**U.S.:** In the U.S. segment, net revenue declined $31.8 million, or 12.2%, driven by the $43.5 million impact associated with the sale of a majority ownership stake of Insomnia Cookies in July 2024. Organic revenue growth of $5.5 million, or 2.5%, was driven by a 14% increase in Points of Access and a 21% increase in digital channel revenues. \n\nU.S. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $8.3 million, or 37.5%, with margin declining 250 basis points to 6.1%, due to incremental vehicle accident claims costs and McDonald’s start-up costs, partially offset by pricing and productivity benefits from the Company’s Hub and Spoke model. Following successful pilots with a third-party logistics partner in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, the Company launched an RFP on October 9th with several national and regional carriers for daily delivery of fresh doughnuts to grocers, convenience stores, quick service restaurants, and others. \n\n**International:** In the International segment, net revenue grew $4.6 million, or 3.7%, with organic revenue growth of $5.3 million or 4.2%, driven by Canada, Japan, and Australia, which more than offset underperformance in the U.K. \n\nInternational segment Adjusted EBITDA margin improved sequentially despite the seasonally weaker quarter as actions taken to reduce costs delivered improved results. Year over year, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.2 million, or 8.7%, with a margin decline of 240 basis points to 17.4%, primarily due to pressure in the U.K. where we have welcomed a new management team focused on improving the business. \n\n**Market Development:** In the Market Development segment, net revenue declined $0.3 million, or approximately 1.5%, due to the $2.1 million impact of franchise acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Market Development organic revenue grew $1.8 million, or approximately 8.6%, with a new market opening in Morocco alongside continued growth in France, Turkey, and Ecuador. \n\nMarket Development Adjusted EBITDA grew $1.5 million, or 14.8%, with margin expansion of 770 basis points delivering Adjusted EBITDA margins of 54.2%, driven by royalty flow through and savings in SG&A. \n\n** Balance Sheet and Capital Expenditures **\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, Operating Cash Flow was $3.3 million. The Company invested $26.1 million, or 6.9% of net revenue, in capital expenditures, driven primarily by the investments in the Hub and Spoke model for the U.S. expansion of the DFD network. During the quarter, the Company received $117.6 million in net proceeds from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies and $45.0 million from the repayment of an intercompany loan due from Insomnia Cookies, which was used to reduce long term debt. \n\n** 2024 Financial Guidance **\n\nWe are adjusting our full year guide to reflect the third quarter results, the acceleration of our expansion with McDonald’s, and the completion of the Insomnia Cookies transaction in July 2024: \n\n  * Net Revenue of $1,650 to $1,685 million \n  * Organic Revenue growth of +5% to +7% \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $205 to $210 million \n  * Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.18 to $0.22 \n  * Income Tax rate between 28% and 30% \n  * Capital Expenditures of 7% to 8% of net revenue \n  * Interest Expense, net of $55 million to $60 million \n\n\n\n** Definitions **\n\nThe following definitions apply to terms used throughout this press release: \n\n  * **Global Points of Access:** Reflects all locations at which fresh doughnuts or cookies can be purchased. We define global points of access to include all Hot Light Theater Shops, Fresh Shops, Carts and Food Trucks, DFD Doors and Cookie Shops, at both Company-owned and franchise locations as of the end of the applicable reporting period. We monitor Global Points of Access as a metric that informs the growth of our omni-channel presence over time and believe this metric is useful to investors to understand our footprint in each of our segments. \n  * **Hubs:** Reflects locations where fresh doughnuts are produced and processed for sale at any point of access. We define Hubs to include self-sustaining Hot Light Theater Shops and Doughnut Factories, at both Company-owned and franchise locations as of the end of the applicable reporting period. \n  * **Sales Per Hub:** Sales per Hub equals Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes, divided by the average number of Hubs with Spokes at the end of each of the five most recent quarters. \n  * **Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes:** Fresh Revenues include product sales generated from our Doughnut Shop business (including digital), as well as DFD sales, but excluding sales from Branded Sweet Treats. It also excludes all Insomnia Cookies revenues as the measure is focused on the Krispy Kreme business. Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes equals the Fresh Revenues derived from those Hubs currently producing product for other shops, Carts and Food Trucks, and/or DFD doors, but excluding Fresh Revenues derived from those Hubs not currently producing product for other shops, Carts and Food Trucks, and/or DFD doors. \n  * **Free Cash Flow:** Defined as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. \n\n\n\n** Conference Call **\n\nKrispy Kreme will host a public conference call at 8:30 AM Eastern Time today to discuss its results for the third quarter of 2024.

The words “continue,” “towards,” “expect,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “explore,” or similar words, or the negative of these words, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and estimates that we consider reasonable but are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to our operations, financial results, financial conditions, business, prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Accordingly, there are, and may be, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. The inclusion of this forward-looking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Our actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements included herein. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and described in the other filings we make from time to time with the SEC. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the impact of pandemics, changes in consumer preferences, the impact of inflation, and our ability to execute on our omni-channel business strategy. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this document, and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by applicable law, to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statement to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise._\n\n** Non-GAAP Measures **\n\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including organic revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Net Debt, Fresh Revenue from Hubs with Spokes and Sales per Hub, which differ from results using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures are not universally consistent calculations, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Other companies may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the SEC. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures. \n\nTo the extent that the Company provides guidance, it does so only on a non-GAAP basis. The Company does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company’s control on certain items, such as net income and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant. \n\n**Krispy Kreme,

**Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited)** **(_in thousands, except per share amounts_ ) **\n\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, and other certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. Adjusted EBITDA is a principal metric that management uses to monitor and evaluate operating performance and provides a consistent benchmark for comparison across reporting periods. \n\nWe define “Adjusted Net Income, Diluted” as net loss attributable to common shareholders, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the tax impact of adjustments, and other certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense items. “Adjusted EPS” is Adjusted Net Income, Diluted converted to a per share amount. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations, including adjustments for income and expense items that are required by GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as share-based compensation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS supplementally. \n\n**Quarter Ended** |  **Three Quarters Ended**  \n---|---  \n**_(in thousands)_ ** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \n**Net income/(loss)** |  **$** |  **37,572** |  **$** |  **(40,258** |  **)** |  **$** |  **25,978** |  **$** |  **(38,530** |  **)**  \nInterest expense, net  |  16,280  |  12,807  |  44,468  |  36,858   \nIncome tax expense  |  17,679  |  24,367  |  18,330  |  17,121   \nDepreciation and amortization expense  |  31,376  |  32,007  |  99,562  |  89,142   \nShare-based compensation  |  9,969  |  7,452  |  24,603  |  17,821   \nEmployer payroll taxes related to share-based compensation  |  49  |  96  |  299  |  310   \nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies  |  (87,128  |  )  |  —  |  (87,128  |  )  |  —   \nOther non-operating (income)/expense, net (1) |  (407  |  )  |  971  |  1,115  |  3,031   \nStrategic initiatives (2) |  11,426  |  5,895  |  20,434  |  23,841   \nAcquisition and integration expenses (3) |  1,938  |  49  |  3,037  |  479   \nNew market penetration expenses (4) |  156  |  678  |  1,194  |  1,013   \nShop closure expenses/(income), net (5) |  21  |  (449  |  )  |  788  |  356   \nRestructuring and severance expenses (6) |  631  |  552  |  769  |  2,799   \nGain on remeasurement of equity method investment (7) |  (5,579  |  )  |  —  |  (5,579  |  )  |  —   \nGain on sale-leaseback  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (9,646  |  )   \nOther (8) |  716  |  (426  |  )  |  (257  |  )  |  2,888   \n**Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **34,699** |  **$** |  **43,741** |  **$** |  **147,613** |  **$** |  **147,483**  \n  \n**Quarter Ended** |  **Three Quarters Ended**  \n---|---  \n**_(in thousands)_ ** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \n**_Segment Adjusted EBITDA:_ **  \nU.S.  |  $  |  13,922  |  $  |  22,258  |  $  |  89,206  |  $  |  88,878   \nInternational  |  22,779  |  24,961  |  64,970  |  68,645   \nMarket Development  |  11,271  |  9,816  |  36,046  |  31,862   \nCorporate  |  (13,273  |  )  |  (13,294  |  )  |  (42,609  |  )  |  (41,902  |  )   \n**Total Adjusted EBITDA** |  **$** |  **34,699** |  **$** |  **43,741** |  **$** |  **147,613** |  **$** |  **147,483**  \n  \n**Quarter Ended** |  **Three Quarters Ended**  \n---|---  \n**_(in thousands, except per share amounts)_ ** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \n**Net income/(loss)** |  **$** |  **37,572** |  **$** |  **(40,258** |  **)** |  **$** |  **25,978** |  **$** |  **(38,530** |  **)**  \nShare-based compensation  |  9,969  |  7,452  |  24,603  |  17,821   \nEmployer payroll taxes related to share-based compensation  |  49  |  96  |  299  |  310   \nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies  |  (87,128  |  )  |  —  |  (87,128  |  )  |  —   \nOther non-operating (income)/expense, net (1) |  (407  |  )  |  971  |  1,115  |  3,031   \nStrategic initiatives (2) |  11,426  |  5,895  |  20,434  |  23,841   \nAcquisition and integration expenses (3) |  1,938  |  49  |  3,037  |  479   \nNew market penetration expenses (4) |  156  |  678  |  1,194  |  1,013   \nShop closure expenses/(income) (5) |  21  |  (449  |  )  |  788  |  356   \nRestructuring and severance expenses (6) |  631  |  552  |  769  |  2,799   \nGain on remeasurement of equity method investment (7) |  (5,579  |  )  |  —  |  (5,579  |  )  |  —   \nGain on sale-leaseback  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (9,646  |  )   \nOther (8) |  716  |  (426  |  )  |  (257  |  )  |  2,888   \nAmortization of acquisition related intangibles (9) |  7,780  |  7,386  |  22,597  |  22,027   \nLoss on extinguishment of 2019 Facility (10) |  —  |  —  |  —  |  472   \nTax impact of adjustments (11) |  20,766  |  22,694  |  13,765  |  8,574   \nTax specific adjustments (12) |  (2,395  |  )  |  (28  |  )  |  (3,210  |  )  |  (2,343  |  )   \nNet loss/(income) attributable to noncontrolling interest  |  1,991  |  (199  |  )  |  (440  |  )  |  (2,005  |  )   \n**Adjusted net (loss)/income attributable to common shareholders -

Contents\nKrispy Kreme, Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\n(dollars in thousands, unless otherwise specified)\nNote 1 — Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nKrispy Kreme, Inc. (“KKI”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Krispy Kreme”) operates through its omni-channel business model to produce\ndoughnuts and deliver fresh doughnut experiences for Doughnut Shops, Delivered Fresh Daily (“DFD”) outlets, and digital channels, expanding consumer access to the\nKrispy Kreme brand.\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments: 1) U.S., which includes all Krispy Kreme Company-owned operations in the U.S., and Insomnia Cookies\nBakeries globally through the date of deconsolidation (refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures for further information); 2) International, which includes all Krispy\nKreme Company-owned operations in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada, and Japan; and 3) Market Development, which includes franchise\noperations across the globe. Unallocated corporate costs are excluded from the Company’s measurement of segment performance.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe Company operates and reports financial information on a 52 or 53-week year with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to December 31. The data periods\ncontained within fiscal years 2023 and 2024 reflect the results of operations for the 52-week periods ended December 31, 2023 and ending December 29, 2024,\nrespectively. The quarters ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 were both 13-week periods.\nThe unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of KKI and subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, these interim financial statements do not include all information and footnotes required under GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments, consisting of\nonly normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, balance sheet, cash flows, and shareholders’ equity for the periods presented.\nAll significant intercompany balances and transactions among KKI and subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities over which the\nCompany has the ability to exercise significant influence but which it does not control and whose financial statements are not otherwise required to be consolidated, are\naccounted for using the equity method.\nThese Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto as of and for the year\nended December 31, 2023, included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from\naudited annual financial statements but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements. The results of operations for the quarter\nended September 29, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire fiscal year ending December 29, 2024.\nNoncontrolling interest in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements represents the interest in subsidiaries held by joint venture partners and\nemployee shareholders. The joint venture partners hold noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries W.K.S. Krispy Kreme, LLC (“WKS Krispy\nKreme”) and Krispy K Canada, Inc. (“KK Canada”). Employee shareholders hold noncontrolling interests in the consolidated subsidiaries Krispy Kreme Holding U.K.\nLtd. (“KK U.K.”), Krispy Kreme Holdings Pty Ltd. (“KK Australia”), and Krispy Kreme Mexico Holding S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“KK Mexico”). Since the Company\nconsolidates the financial statements of these subsidiaries, the noncontrolling owners’ share of each subsidiary’s net assets and results of operations are deducted and\nreported as noncontrolling interest in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome/(Loss).\n7\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the significant\naccounting policies during the quarter ended September 29, 2024.\nReclassifications\nSegment information is prepared on the same basis on which the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.\nEffective January 1, 2024, the Company realigned its segment reporting structure such that the Company-owned Canada and Japan businesses have moved from the\nMarket Development reportable operating segment to the International reportable operating segment. All segment information for comparative periods has been restated\nto be consistent with current presentation.\nIn the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Investments in unconsolidated entities in the comparative period have been reclassified (formerly presented within\nOther assets) to be consistent with current quarter presentation. This reclassification does not have a significant impact on the reported financial position and does not\nimpact the results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim\nperiods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the\ntitle and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the\nquantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. When adopted, we expect this ASU to impact our segment disclosures, but with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows,\nand financial condition.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid disclosures. The ASU requires a public business entity (“PBE”) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages\nand currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further disaggregated by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items\nexceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign and\nby individual jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the ASU is effective for annual periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity should apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively, with retrospective application permitted.\nWhen adopted, we expect this ASU to impact our income tax disclosures, but with no impacts to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\n8\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Relationship Agreement with McDonald’s\nOn March 22, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a Business Relationship Agreement (the “Agreement”) with McDonald’s USA, LLC\n(“McDonald’s”). The Agreement provides, among other things, that the parties will work together to develop a deployment schedule for a U.S. national rollout of the\nsale of Krispy Kreme doughnuts at McDonald’s restaurants to be implemented by McDonald’s. The deployment schedule will set forth the anticipated launch period for\neach McDonald’s business unit (“BU”) in the U.S. McDonald’s agreed to introduce and make available certain Krispy Kreme products to McDonald’s restaurants in the\nU.S. for one year post-conclusion of such rollout. The Agreement does not guarantee Krispy Kreme any particular level of BU deployment, sales, or profits. From the\nEffective Date through December 31, 2026 (unless the Agreement is earlier terminated), the Company agreed not to (i) supply any doughnuts to any other quick service\nor fast casual restaurant (“QSR”) in the U.S. for sale or distribution by such QSR, (ii) assist any other person or entity to do the foregoing or any QSR to make or have\nmade doughnuts, or (iii) license or authorize any other QSR in the U.S. to use any Krispy Kreme brand on or in connection with the sale of doughnuts. McDonald’s\nagreed to not sell within the U.S. any third-party branded, fresh doughnuts or McDonald’s branded, white-labeled or unbranded doughnuts (subject to certain carve-\nouts). The Agreement does not grant McDonald’s any exclusivity outside of the U.S. The initial term of the Agreement begins on the Effective Date and ends one year\nfollowing the last BU rollout and automatically renews for consecutive one-year periods (unless the Agreement is earlier terminated). Either party may terminate for\ncause under certain circumstances during the initial term or any renewal term and upon six months’ prior notice during any renewal term.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 — Acquisitions and Divestitures\n2024 Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition of Krispy Kreme Shops\nIn the quarter ended September 29, 2024, the Company acquired the business and operating assets of two franchisees, consisting of nine Krispy Kreme shops in the U.S.\nand one Krispy Kreme shop in Canada. Prior to the acquisition, the Company was a minority investor in the shops via its equity method investments in KremeWorks\nUSA, LLC and KremeWorks Canada, L.P. The Company paid consideration of $31.4 million, consisting of $26.7 million of cash (exclusive of $6.7 million proceeds for\nthe Company’s equity method investments), $2.1 million of consideration payable to the sellers, and $2.6 million settlement of amounts related to pre-existing\nrelationships, to acquire substantially all of the shops’ assets. Consideration payable of $2.1 million was withheld primarily to cover indemnification claims that could\narise after closing. Absent any claims, these amounts are payable quarterly over the 18 months following the acquisition date. The settlement of pre-existing\nrelationships included in the purchase consideration includes the settlement of accounts and notes receivable, net of deferred revenue, of $0.6 million. It also includes\nthe disposal of the franchise intangible asset related to the franchisees with a cumulative net book value of $2.0 million at the acquisition date.

(“KK Spain”),\nfor approximately $0.8 million in cash. As the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over both KK Brazil and KK Spain, but does not have the ability\nto exercise control, the investments are accounted for using the equity method, and equity method earnings are recognized within Other income, net in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\nAcquisition of Additional Units in Consolidated Subsidiary Awesome Doughnut\nIn the quarter ended September 29, 2024, the Company purchased all units held by the noncontrolling interest holders in the consolidated subsidiary Awesome\nDoughnut, LLC (“Awesome Doughnut”) for $32.9 million in cash.

On August 1, 2024, the Company received additional cash of $45.0 million from Insomnia Cookies related to the settlement of an intercompany loan.\nThe transaction resulted in the Company’s ownership of Insomnia Cookies declining from 75.0% to 34.7% with a loss of control. Accordingly, the Company\ndeconsolidated Insomnia Cookies from the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and recorded a gain on divestiture of $87.1 million (gross of\nincome taxes) which is included within Gain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The gain was calculated as\nfollows:\nJuly 17, 2024\nCash proceeds $ 120,870\nFair value of retained noncontrolling interest in Insomnia Cookies 85,086\nCarrying value of former noncontrolling interest in Insomnia Cookies 33,579\nLess: Carrying value of net assets of Insomnia Cookies, including cash and cash equivalents (152,407)\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies $ 87,128\nAs the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over Insomnia Cookies, but does not have the ability to exercise control, the investment is accounted for\nusing the equity method. The fair value of the equity method investment of $85.1 million was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation in a risk-neutral framework to\nmodel the likelihood of the Company’s potential future sale of its noncontrolling interest in Insomnia Cookies. The valuation methodology includes assumptions and\njudgments regarding probability weighting, discount rates, operating results of Insomnia Cookies, and expected timing of a future exit by the investors. Equity method\nearnings are recognized within Other non-operating (income)/expense, net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n2023 Acquisitions and Divestitures\nIn the quarter and

The Company’s derivatives are valued using discounted cash\nflow analyses that incorporate observable market parameters, such as interest rate yield curves and currency rates.\n15\nTable of Contents\nNote 7 — Derivative Instruments\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Company uses forward contracts to protect against the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of ingredients of its products, of which flour, sugar, and\nshortening are the most significant, and the cost of gasoline used by its delivery vehicles. Management has not designated these forward contracts as hedges. As of\nSeptember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of commodity derivatives was 1.2 million and 1.8 million gallons of fuel, respectively. They are\nscheduled to mature between September 2024 and September 2025 and January 2024 and December 2024, respectively. As of both September 29, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company recorded liabilities of $0.1 million related to the fair market values of its commodity derivatives. The settlement of commodity\nderivative contracts is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a cash flow from operating activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility from its debt arrangements. Management has designated the swap agreements as\ncash flow hedges and recognized the changes in the fair value of these swaps in other comprehensive income. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany has recorded a liability of $13.5 million and an asset of $1.6 million, respectively, related to the fair market values of its interest rate derivatives. The cash\nflows associated with the interest rate swaps are reflected in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, which is consistent with the\nclassification as operating activities of the interest payments on the term loan.\nIn the quarter ended June 30, 2024, existing interest rate swap agreements (the “prior agreements”) with an aggregate notional amount of $505.0 million matured. The\nCompany then entered into new interest rate swap agreements (the “new agreements”) with an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million as of September 29, 2024.\nThe primary difference between the new agreements and the prior agreements included the setting of new rates on the fixed component of the swaps (weighted average\nof approximately of 4.0%). The new agreements have a benchmark rate on the floating component of the swaps of one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(“SOFR”) and are scheduled to mature in March 2028.\nThe net effect of the interest rate swap arrangements will be to fix the variable interest rate on the term loan under the 2023 Facility (as defined in Note 9, Long-Term\nDebt) up to the notional amount outstanding at the rates payable under the swap agreements plus the Applicable Rate (as defined by the 2023 Facility), through the swap\nmaturity dates in March 2028.\nIn the quarter ended April 2, 2023, the Company cancelled certain interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $265.0 million, collecting $7.7\nmillion in cash proceeds, and entered into new agreements with the same counterparties. The cash flows are reflected in operating activities in the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily from its investments in consolidated subsidiaries that operate in Canada, the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New\nZealand, Mexico, and Japan. In order to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on commercial and financial transactions with these subsidiaries, the\nCompany enters into foreign exchange forward contracts. Management has not designated these forward contracts as hedges. As of September 29, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, the total notional amount of foreign exchange derivatives was $76.8 million and $49.8 million, respectively. The majority matured in October 2024\nand January 2024, respectively. The Company recorded assets of $0.3 million and liabilities of $0.3 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, related to the fair market values of its foreign exchange derivatives.\n16\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative Summary of Derivative Positions and Their Effect on Results of Operations\nThe following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 29, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and derivatives designated as hedging instruments, respectively.

The Company’s typical payment terms for trade payables\nrange up to 180 days outside of the SCF program, depending on the type of vendors and the nature of the supplies or services. For vendors under the SCF program, the\nCompany has established payable terms ranging up to, but not exceeding, 360 days. When participating vendors elect to sell one or more of the Company’s payment\nobligations, the Company’s rights and obligations to settle the payables on their contractual due date are not impacted. The Company has no economic or commercial\ninterest in a vendor’s decision to enter into these agreements and the financial institutions do not provide the Company with incentives such as rebates or profit sharing\nunder the SCF program. The Company agrees on commercial terms with vendors for the goods and services procured, which are consistent with payment terms\nobserved at other peer companies in the industry, and as the terms are not impacted by the SCF program, such obligations are classified as Accounts payable in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated cash flows are included in operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nStructured Payables Programs\nThe Company utilizes various card products issued by financial institutions to facilitate purchases of goods and services. By using these products, the Company may\nreceive differing levels of rebates based on timing of repayment. The payment obligations under these card products are classified as Structured payables in the\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated cash flows are included in financing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n18\nTable of Contents\nNote 9 — Long-Term Debt\nThe Company’s long-term debt obligations consists of the following:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2023 Facility — term loan $ 656,250 $ 682,500\n2023 Facility — revolving credit facility 142,500 155,000\nShort-term lines of credit 2,500 11,000\nLess: Debt issuance costs (3,584) (4,371)\nFinance lease obligations 54,549 47,117\nTotal long-term debt 852,215 891,246\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt (47,577) (54,631)\nLong-term debt, less current portion $ 804,638 $ 836,615\n2023 Secured Credit Facility\nThe Company is party to a credit agreement (the “2023 Facility”) consisting of a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a term loan with an original\nprincipal amount of $700.0 million.

The tax effects of\nsignificant unusual or infrequently occurring items are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which\nthey occur.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rates were 32.0% and 41.4% for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and -153.3% and -80.0%\nfor the quarter and three quarters ended October 1, 2023, respectively. The Company’s effective income tax rate for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29,\n2024 differed from the respective statutory rates primarily due to disallowed executive compensation expense, the mix of income and taxes attributable to foreign\njurisdictions, and noncontrolling interest in domestic joint ventures. Additionally, the Company recorded an income tax benefit in the quarter ended September 29, 2024\nrelated to the release of valuation allowances on state net operating losses associated with the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies. The Company’s effective income tax rate\nfor the quarter and three quarters ended October 1, 2023 differed from the respective statutory rates primarily due to the mix of income and taxes attributable to foreign\njurisdictions, the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits, disallowed executive compensation expense, noncontrolling interest in domestic joint ventures,\nand a discrete tax benefit unrelated to ongoing operations.\nNote 12 — Commitments and Contingencies\nPending Litigation\nIn March 2023, an employee filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated against the Company, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric\nInformation Privacy Act. In October 2024, the Company negotiated a settlement of this lawsuit, subject to court approval, which would require the Company to pay an\namount immaterial to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Legal Matters\nThe Company also is engaged in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company maintains insurance policies against certain kinds of\nsuch claims and suits, including insurance policies for workers’ compensation and personal injury, all of which are subject to deductibles. While the ultimate outcome of\nthese matters could differ from management’s expectations, management currently does not believe their resolution will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company’s primary banks issued letters of credit on its behalf totaling $20.3 million and $15.4 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, a majority of which secure the Company’s reimbursement obligations to insurers under its self-insurance arrangements.\nNote 13 — Related Party Transactions\nAs of September 29, 2024 the Company held minority equity interests in four entities, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts France SAS (“KK France”) (33% ownership), KK\nBrazil (45% ownership), KK Spain (25% ownership), and Insomnia Cookies (35% ownership), with an aggregate carrying value of $91.0 million.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and\nrelated notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in other reports filed subsequently with the SEC.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The words “believe,” “may,” “could,” “will,” “should,” “anticipate,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “outlook,” “guidance,” or similar words, or the negative of these words, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements\nare based on certain assumptions and estimates that we consider reasonable but are subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to our operations, financial\nresults, financial condition, business, prospects, growth strategy and liquidity.

We believe that these factors include, but are\nnot limited to, changes in consumer preferences, the impact of inflation, and our ability to execute on our omni-channel business strategy. These forward-looking\nstatements are made only as of the date of this document, and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by applicable law, to update or revise\nany forward-looking or cautionary statement to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future operating\nresults over time or otherwise.\nOverview\nKrispy Kreme is one of the most beloved and well-known sweet treat brands in the world. Krispy Kreme operates in 40 countries with our transformational omni-\nchannel strategy, which focuses on delivering fresh doughnuts such as our iconic Original Glazed® doughnut, which is universally recognized for its hot-off-the-line,\nmelt-in-your-mouth experience, to where our consumers are located and want to have access to them. Global Points of Access are a key metric and we define them as\nour unique network of fresh Doughnut Shops, partnerships with leading retailers (DFD Doors), and a rapidly growing digital business. Our purpose of touching and\nenhancing lives through the joy that is Krispy Kreme guides how we operate every day and is reflected in the love we have for our people, our communities, and the\nplanet.\nThe following table presents a summary of our financial results for the periods presented:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\n(in thousands, except percentages) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 % Change September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 % Change\nNet Revenues (1) $ 379,867 $ 407,367 -6.8 % $ 1,261,374 $ 1,235,199 2.1 %\nNet Income/(Loss) Attributable to\nKrispy Kreme, Inc. 39,563 (40,457) 197.8 % 25,538 (40,535) 163.0 %\nAdjusted Net (Loss)/Income, Diluted\n(2) (2,498) 4,406 -156.7 % 17,937 31,073 -42.3 %\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) 34,699 43,741 -20.7 % 147,613 147,483 0.1 %\n(1) We generated 3.5% and 6.1% organic revenue growth for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024.\n(2) Refer to “Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures” below for more information as to how we define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted\nNet Income, Diluted and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, Diluted to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n27\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Events and Transactions\nExecuting on our Omni-Channel Strategy\nWe made strong progress on the execution of our omni-channel strategy in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, as we continue to add quality Global Points of Access across\nour network and convert markets into fully implemented Hub and Spoke models (discussed in greater detail under “Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP\nMeasures” below). We added 244 new Krispy Kreme branded Global Points of Access in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to reach 15,811 Global Points of Access. The\nprimary driver of the increased Krispy Kreme branded Global Points of Access during the third quarter was the continued expansion of our DFD network in alignment\nwith our transformation strategy, as we added 210 DFD Doors globally, primarily within the U.S. segment. The increase in DFD Doors is the result of our focus on\nexecuting our omni-channel strategy to drive our transformation, and includes expansion with key customers. We expect DFD growth to be one of our most significant\ndrivers of earnings growth, primarily through increased door count and also through optimization of revenue per door. Deployment of the omni-channel strategy in the\nU.S. led to an increase of 2.1% in Sales per Hub in the trailing four quarters, from $4.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to $4.9 million in the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024. The increase in our Sales per Hub contributed to U.S. segment organic revenue growth of 2.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our goal is to continue to\ngrow our Sales per Hub over time, which we believe will drive higher margins and higher return on invested capital.\nIn addition to grocery and convenience stores, we are also expanding in DFD channels such as QSR and club membership to further broaden availability of our\ndoughnuts to consumers. This includes our QSR partnership with McDonald’s. Following a successful pilot at approximately 160 McDonald’s shops in Louisville and\nLexington, Kentucky and the surrounding area, we entered into an agreement to work with McDonald’s to develop a deployment schedule for a U.S. national rollout of\nthe sale of Krispy Kreme doughnuts at McDonald’s restaurants. The deployment schedule sets forth the anticipated launch period for each McDonald’s business unit in\nthe U.S., with phasing expected from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 through the end of fiscal 2026. The rollout commenced at McDonald’s restaurants in Chicago in\nOctober, with expansion to restaurants in Ohio and Indiana scheduled shortly thereafter. The agreement does not guarantee us any particular level of business unit\ndeployment, sales, or profits.\nDivestiture of Insomnia Cookies\nOn July 17, 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in exchange for cash proceeds of $120.9 million. On August 1, 2024\nwe received additional cash of $45.0 million from Insomnia Cookies related to the settlement of an intercompany loan. We have begun to use these proceeds to further\nstrengthen our fresh doughnut business and expand availability, as well as pay down debt. We continue to own 34.7% of Insomnia Cookies and will account for our\ninvestment using the equity method.\nGrowing our Global Presence\nAnother key strategic initiative on our journey to become the Most Loved Sweet Treat Brand in the World is to increase our global presence, focusing on the percentage\nof our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA generated outside the U.S., with a key focus in Europe and select Asian and South American countries. In the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024, we opened our first franchise shops in Morocco and we expect to have shop openings in Brazil, Spain, and Germany in the future. We expect to have further\nannouncements throughout the year as we grow our global business.\n28\nTable of Contents\nDigital, Brand, and Innovation\nDigital channel sales represented a healthy 15.5% of our Doughnut Shop sales (excluding DFD) for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up 290 basis points from 12.6% in\nthe same quarter last year (excluding Insomnia Cookies from both periods). Our growth in digital is due to our focus on owned channel improvements and increasing\nproduct availability through third parties.\nInnovation is a significant driver of frequency as we create and introduce premium and buzz-worthy offerings to consumers across our Global Points of Access. During\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered the joy that is Krispy Kreme through specialty doughnuts and seasonal activations including Passport to Paris, Barbie, and\nPumpkin Spice, among many others around the world.\nSegment Reclassifications\nAs discussed in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item\n1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, effective January 1, 2024, we realigned our segment reporting structure such that the Company-owned Canada and\nJapan businesses have moved from the Market Development reportable operating segment to the International reportable operating segment. All segment information\nfor comparative periods has been restated to be consistent with current presentation.\n29\nTable of Contents\nKey Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures\nWe monitor the key business metrics and non-GAAP metrics set forth below to help us evaluate our business and growth trends, establish budgets, measure the\neffectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. The calculation of the key business metrics discussed below may differ from other\nsimilarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.\nWe utilize “Global Points of Access” as a key performance indicator. Global Points of Access reflect all locations at which fresh doughnuts can be purchased. Global\nPoints of Access include all Hot Light Theater Shops, Fresh Shops, Carts and Food Trucks, DFD Doors, Cookie Bakeries (through the date of the Insomnia Cookies\ndivestiture), and other defined points at both Company-owned and franchise locations as of the end of the respective reporting period. We monitor Global Points of\nAccess as a metric that informs the growth of our omni-channel presence over time and believe this metric is useful to investors to understand our footprint in each of\nour segments and by asset type.\nThe following table presents our Global Points of Access, by segment and type, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and\nfiscal 2023, respectively:\nGlobal Points of Access\nQuarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 December 31, 2023\nU.S.:\nHot Light Theater Shops 236 229 229\nFresh Shops 71 65 70\nCookie Bakeries (3) — 249 267\nDFD Doors (2) 7,711 6,506 6,808\nTotal 8,018 7,049 7,374\nInternational:\nHot Light Theater Shops 48 45 44\nFresh Shops 508 479 483\nCarts, Food Trucks, and Other (1) 17 16 16\nDFD Doors 4,867 3,588 3,977\nTotal 5,440 4,128 4,520\nMarket Development:\nHot Light Theater Shops 110 113 116\nFresh Shops 1,059 920 968\nCarts, Food Trucks, and Other (1) 30 29 30\nDFD Doors 1,154 1,155 1,139\nTotal 2,353 2,217 2,253\nTotal Global Points of Access (as defined) 15,811 13,394 14,147\nTotal Hot Light Theater Shops 394 387 389\nTotal Fresh Shops 1,638 1,464 1,521\nTotal Cookie Bakeries (3) — 249 267\nTotal Shops 2,032 2,100 2,177\nTotal Carts, Food Trucks, and Other 47 45 46\nTotal DFD Doors 13,732 11,249 11,924\nTotal Global Points of Access (as defined) 15,811 13,394 14,147\n(1) Carts and Food Trucks are non-producing, mobile (typically on wheels) facilities without walls or a door where product is received from a Hot Light Theater\nShop or Doughnut Factory.

During\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2024, we added a net 35 additional Krispy Kreme branded shops globally, including two Hot Light Theater Shops and 33 Fresh Shops. We\nadded a net 210 new DFD Doors during the quarter as we continue to focus on the deployment of our Hub and Spoke model and our expansion into QSR channels. We\nplan to continue adding new locations and expanding our digital platform in order to extend the availability of and access to our products. We are excited about our\npartnership with McDonald’s and the phasing of a U.S. national rollout, which we believe has validated the attractiveness of the QSR channel.\nWe also utilize “Hubs” as a key performance indicator. Our transformation is driven by the implementation of an omni-channel strategy to reach more consumers where\nthey are and drive revenue growth, and this strategy is supported by a capital-efficient Hub and Spoke distribution model that provides a route to market and powers\nprofitability. Our Hot Light Theater Shops and Doughnut Factories serve as centralized production facilities (“Hubs”). From these Hubs, we deliver doughnuts to our\nFresh Shops, Carts and Food Trucks, and DFD Doors (“Spokes”) primarily through an integrated network of Company-operated delivery routes, designed to ensure\nquality and freshness. We are currently exploring an increase in third-party managed delivery to DFD customers in the U.S., an approach we have used in several\ninternational markets. Specific to the U.S. segment, certain legacy Hubs have not historically had Spokes. Many Hubs in the U.S. segment are being converted to add\nSpokes while certain legacy Hubs do not currently have the ability or need to add Spokes.\nThe following table presents our Hubs, by segment and type, as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the third quarter of fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2023,\nrespectively:\nHubs\nQuarter Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 December 31, 2023\nU.S.:\nHot Light Theater Shops (1) 230 222 220\nDoughnut Factories 6 4 4\nTotal 236 226 224\nHubs with Spokes 152 148 149\nHubs without Spokes 84 78 75\nInternational:\nHot Light Theater Shops (1) 39 36 36\nDoughnut Factories 14 14 14\nTotal 53 50 50\nHubs with Spokes 53 50 50\nMarket Development:\nHot Light Theater Shops (1) 108 109 112\nDoughnut Factories 26 23 23\nTotal 134 132 135\nTotal Hubs 423 408 409\n(1) Includes only Hot Light Theater Shops and excludes Mini Theaters.

Other companies may calculate\nsimilarly titled financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of\nfinancial performance under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in conjunction with our historical Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ.\nOrganic Revenue Growth\nOrganic revenue growth measures our revenue growth trends excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, and we believe it is useful for\ninvestors to understand the expansion of our global footprint through internal efforts. We define “organic revenue growth” as the growth in revenues, excluding (i)\nacquired shops owned by us for less than 12 months following their acquisition, (ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, (iii) the impact of shop\nclosures related to restructuring programs such as the shop portfolio optimization program initiated for Krispy Kreme U.S. during fiscal 2022, (iv) the impact of the\nBranded Sweat Treats business exit, (v) the impact of the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies, and (vi) revenues generated during the 53rd week for those fiscal years that\nhave a 53rd week based on our fiscal calendar defined in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See “Results of Operations” for our organic growth calculations\nfor the periods presented.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS\nWe define “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings before interest expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for share-\nbased compensation, certain strategic initiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, and other certain non-recurring, infrequent or non-core income and expense\nitems. Adjusted EBITDA is a principal metric that management uses to monitor and evaluate operating performance and provides a consistent benchmark for\ncomparison across reporting periods.\nWe define “Adjusted Net Income, Diluted” as net loss attributable to common shareholders, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, certain strategic\ninitiatives, acquisition and integration expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, the tax impact of adjustments, and other certain non-recurring,\ninfrequent or non-core income and expense items. “Adjusted EPS” is Adjusted Net Income, Diluted converted to a per share amount.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS have certain limitations, including adjustments for income and expense items that are required by\nGAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments\nin this presentation, such as share-based compensation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS should not be\nconstrued to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in\naddition to using Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, and Adjusted EPS supplementally.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and net income/(loss) to Adjusted Net Income, Diluted and Adjusted EPS for the\nperiods presented:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\n(in thousands) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\nNet income/(loss) $ 37,572 $ (40,258) $ 25,978 $ (38,530)\nInterest expense, net 16,280 12,807 44,468 36,858\nIncome tax expense 17,679 24,367 18,330 17,121\nDepreciation and amortization expense 31,376 32,007 99,562 89,142\nShare-based compensation 9,969 7,452 24,603 17,821\nEmployer payroll taxes related to share-based compensation 49 96 299 310\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (87,128) — (87,128) —\nOther non-operating (income)/expense, net (1) (407) 971 1,115 3,031\nStrategic initiatives (2) 11,426 5,895 20,434 23,841\nAcquisition and integration expenses (3) 1,938 49 3,037 479\nNew market penetration expenses (4) 156 678 1,194 1,013\nShop closure expenses/(income), net (5) 21 (449) 788 356\nRestructuring and severance expenses (6) 631 552 769 2,799\nGain on remeasurement of equity method investment (7) (5,579) — (5,579) —\nGain on sale-leaseback — — — (9,646)\nOther (8) 716 (426) (257) 2,888\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 34,699 $ 43,741 $ 147,613 $ 147,483\n33\nTable of Contents\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\n(in thousands, except per share amounts) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\nNet income/(loss) $ 37,572 $ (40,258) $ 25,978 $ (38,530)\nShare-based compensation 9,969 7,452 24,603 17,821\nEmployer payroll taxes related to share-based compensation 49 96 299 310\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (87,128) — (87,128) —\nOther non-operating (income)/expense, net (1) (407) 971 1,115 3,031\nStrategic initiatives (2) 11,426 5,895 20,434 23,841\nAcquisition and integration expenses (3) 1,938 49 3,037 479\nNew market penetration expenses (4) 156 678 1,194 1,013\nShop closure expenses/(income) (5) 21 (449) 788 356\nRestructuring and severance expenses (6) 631 552 769 2,799\nGain on remeasurement of equity method investment (7) (5,579) — (5,579) —\nGain on sale-leaseback — — — (9,646)\nOther (8) 716 (426) (257) 2,888\nAmortization of acquisition related intangibles (9) 7,780 7,386 22,597 22,027\nLoss on extinguishment of 2019 Facility (10) — — — 472\nTax impact of adjustments (11) 20,766 22,694 13,765 8,574\nTax specific adjustments (12) (2,395) (28) (3,210) (2,343)\nNet loss/(income) attributable to noncontrolling interest 1,991 (199) (440) (2,005)\nAdjusted net (loss)/income attributable to common shareholders - Basic $ (2,494) $ 4,413 $ 17,965 $ 31,087\nAdditional income attributed to noncontrolling interest due to\nsubsidiary potential common shares (4) (7) (28) (14)\nAdjusted net (loss)/income attributable to common shareholders -\nDiluted $ (2,498) $ 4,406 $ 17,937 $ 31,073\nBasic weighted average common shares outstanding 169,596 168,224 169,125 168,183\nDilutive effect of outstanding common stock options, RSUs, and PSUs — 2,421 2,259 2,249\nDiluted weighted average common shares outstanding 169,596 170,645 171,384 170,432\nAdjusted net (loss)/income per share attributable to common\nshareholders:\nBasic $ (0.01) $ 0.03 $ 0.11 $ 0.18\nDiluted $ (0.01) $ 0.03 $ 0.10 $ 0.18\n(1) Primarily foreign translation gains and losses in each period.\n(2) The quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2024 consist primarily of costs associated with the divestiture of the Insomnia Cookies business, preparing for\nthe McDonald’s U.S. expansion, and global transformation.

Sales per Hub equals Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes, divided by the average number of Hubs with Spokes during the period.\nFresh Revenues include product sales generated from our Doughnut Shop business (including digital channels), as well as DFD sales, but excluding all Insomnia\nCookies revenues as the measure is focused on the Krispy Kreme business. The Average Hub with Spokes for a period is calculated as the average of the number of\nHubs with Spokes at the end of the five most recent quarters. The Sales per Hub performance measure allows us and investors to measure our effectiveness at leveraging\nthe Hubs in the Hub and Spoke model to distribute product and generate cost efficiencies and profitability.\nSales per Hub was as follows for each of the periods below:\nTrailing Four Quarters\nEnded Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, December 31, January 1,\n(in thousands, unless otherwise stated) 2024 2023 2023\nU.S.:\nRevenues $ 1,109,621 $ 1,104,944 $ 1,010,250\nNon-Fresh Revenues (1) (3,857) (9,416) (38,380)\nFresh Revenues from Insomnia Cookies and Hubs without Spokes (2) (360,354) (399,061) (404,430)\nSales from Hubs with Spokes 745,410 696,467 567,440\nSales per Hub (millions) 4.9 4.9 4.5\nInternational:\nSales from Hubs with Spokes (3) $ 511,694 $ 489,631 $ 435,651\nSales per Hub (millions) (4) 10.1 10.0 9.7\n(1) Includes the exited Branded Sweet Treats business revenues as well as licensing royalties from customers for use of the Krispy Kreme brand.\n(2) Includes Insomnia Cookies revenues (through the date of the divestiture) and Fresh Revenues generated by Hubs without Spokes.\n(3) Total International net revenues is equal to Fresh Revenues from Hubs with Spokes for that business segment.\n(4) International Sales per Hub comparative data has been restated in constant currency based on current exchange rates.\nIn our International segment, where the Hub and Spoke model originated, Sales per Hub reached $10.1 million, up from $10.0 million generated in the full fiscal year\n2023, and up from $9.7 million generated in the full fiscal year 2022. The International segment illustrates the benefits of leveraging our Hub and Spoke model as the\nmost efficient way to grow the business, as shown by the consistent Sales per Hub and higher Adjusted EBITDA margins despite elevated commodity costs and\nmacroeconomic conditions. In the U.S. segment, we had Sales per Hub of $4.9 million, consistent with the $4.9 million generated in the full fiscal year 2023 and up\nfrom $4.5 million generated in the full fiscal year 2022. In the U.S. we continue our efforts to increase the number of quality DFD Doors served by our Hubs as we\nmake progress toward optimizing the segment to look more like our International segment. As we further extend the Hub and Spoke model into existing and new\nmarkets around the world, we expect to see our Sales per Hub continue to grow.\n36\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following comparisons are historical results and are not indicative of future results, which could differ materially from the historical financial information\npresented.\nQuarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the Quarter ended October 1, 2023\nThe following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 and the quarter ended October 1,\n2023:\nQuarter Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n(in thousands, except percentages) Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue $ %\nNet revenues\nProduct sales $ 370,662 97.6 % $ 398,745 97.9 % $ (28,083) -7.0 %\nRoyalties and other revenues 9,205 2.4 % 8,622 2.1 % 583 6.8 %\nTotal net revenues 379,867 100.0 % 407,367 100.0 % (27,500) -6.8 %\nProduct and distribution costs 95,840 25.2 % 101,353 24.9 % (5,513) -5.4 %\nOperating expenses 192,027 50.6 % 195,380 48.0 % (3,353) -1.7 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense 71,110 18.7 % 68,305 16.8 % 2,805 4.1 %\nMarketing expenses 10,680 2.8 % 12,478 3.1 % (1,798) -14.4 %\nPre-opening costs 619 0.2 % 1,059 0.3 % (440) -41.5 %\nOther income, net (5,781) -1.5 % (1,102) -0.3 % (4,679) -424.6 %\nDepreciation and amortization expense 31,376 8.3 % 32,007 7.9 % (631) -2.0 %\nOperating loss (16,004) -4.2 % (2,113) -0.5 % (13,891) -657.4 %\nInterest expense, net 16,280 4.3 % 12,807 3.1 % 3,473 27.1 %\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (87,128) -22.9 % — — % (87,128) -100.0 %\nOther non-operating (income)/expense, net (407) -0.1 % 971 0.2 % (1,378) -141.9 %\nIncome/(loss) before income taxes 55,251 14.5 % (15,891) -3.9 % 71,142 447.7 %\nIncome tax expense 17,679 4.7 % 24,367 6.0 % (6,688) -27.4 %\nNet income/(loss) 37,572 9.9 % (40,258) -9.9 % 77,830 193.3 %\nNet (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interest (1,991) -0.5 % 199 — % (2,190) -1,100.5 %\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Krispy Kreme, Inc. $ 39,563 10.4 % $ (40,457) -9.9 % $ 80,020 197.8 %\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a further breakdown of total net revenue and organic revenue growth by segment for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to\nthe quarter ended October 1, 2023:\nMarket Total\n(in thousands, except percentages) U.S. International Development Company\nTotal net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2024 $ 228,376 $ 130,697 $ 20,794 $ 379,867\nTotal net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2023 260,177 126,077 21,113 407,367\nTotal Net Revenues Growth (31,801) 4,620 (319) (27,500)\nTotal Net Revenues Growth % -12.2 % 3.7 % -1.5 % -6.8 %\nLess: Impact of Insomnia Cookies divestiture (43,531) — — (43,531)\nAdjusted net revenues in third quarter of fiscal 2023 216,646 126,077 21,113 363,836\nAdjusted net revenue growth 11,730 4,620 (319) 16,031\nImpact of acquisitions (6,228) (1,108) 2,127 (5,209)\nImpact of foreign currency translation — 1,770 — 1,770\nOrganic Revenue Growth $ 5,502 $ 5,282 $ 1,808 $ 12,592\nOrganic Revenue Growth % 2.5 % 4.2 % 8.6 % 3.5 %\nTotal net revenue declined $27.5 million, or approximately 6.8%, primarily due to the $43.5 million reduction associated with the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies in\nJuly 2024, partially offset by $5.2 million from shops acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Organic revenue growth of $12.6 million, or approximately 3.5%, was\ndriven by the continued and successful execution of our omni-channel growth strategy globally, high impact brand activations, and product premiumization efforts. We\nhave continued to increase availability through 2,417, or 18.0%, additional Global Points of Access, primarily including new capital-light DFD Doors, and via digital\nchannels. Additionally, we have continued to take pricing actions to offset cost inflation, with average pricing increasing approximately 4%, partially offset by\ntransaction volume declines from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nOur U.S. segment net revenue declined $31.8 million, or approximately 12.2%, primarily due to the $43.5 million reduction associated with the divestiture of Insomnia\nCookies in July 2024, partially offset by $6.2 million from shops acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Organic revenue increased $5.5 million, or approximately\n2.5%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven by Points of Access growth of 969, or 13.7%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 and growth in Krispy Kreme branded digital channel revenues of 21%. Our organic growth has been supplemented by effective pricing increases with average\npricing increasing approximately 4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, leading to an increase in the average transaction size, but\npartially offset by transaction volume declines.\nOur International segment net revenue grew $4.6 million, or approximately 3.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, in spite of\nforeign currency translation impacts of $1.8 million primarily from a weaker Mexican peso. International organic revenue grew $5.3 million, or approximately 4.2%,\nfrom the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven primarily by increased pricing of approximately 4% and Points of Access growth of 1,312,\nor 31.8%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. International organic revenue growth was partially offset by lower transaction volume compared to last year,\nparticularly in the U.K.\nOur Market Development segment net revenue declined $0.3 million, or approximately 1.5%, due to the $2.1 million impact of franchise acquisitions in the third quarter\nof fiscal 2024. Market Development organic revenue grew $1.8 million, or approximately 8.6%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024\ndue to the continued expansion of our international franchise business.\nProduct and distribution costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Product and distribution costs decreased $5.5 million, or 5.4%, from the third quarter of\nfiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, largely in line with and attributable to the same factors as our revenue decline. As a percentage of revenue, product and\ndistribution costs increased by approximately 30 basis points from 24.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 25.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to\nsales mix shift, increased DFD returns, and impacts from increased discounting.\n38\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses: Operating expenses decreased $3.4 million, or 1.7%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, driven mainly by a\n$21.2 million impact from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies partially offset by increases of $17.8 million in operating expenses for the global Krispy Kreme brand.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 260 basis points, from 48.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to 50.6% in the third quarter\nof fiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of discounting and lower transaction volumes on operating leverage.\nSelling, general and administrative expense: Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense increased $2.8 million, or 4.1%, from the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense increased approximately 190 basis points, from 16.8% in the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 to 18.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by $11.3 million related to preparing for and executing the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (including\nshare-based compensation expenses), partially offset by cost control initiatives and lower employee cash incentive compensation by $3.6 million in the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024.\nOther income, net: Other income, net of $5.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by a gain of $5.6 million related to the remeasurement of equity\nmethod investments to fair value immediately prior to the acquisition of Krispy Kreme shops referenced in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other income, net of $1.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 was primarily driven by business interruption insurance recoveries for the Krispy Kreme U.S. business.\nDepreciation and amortization expense: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.6 million, or 2.0%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter\nof fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 40 basis points, from 7.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023\nto 8.3% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher capital spend and assets placed into service to support the Hub and Spoke model evolution,\nincluding preparing for the acceleration of our U.S. national DFD rollout discussed in “Significant Events and Transactions” above.\nInterest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased $3.5 million, or 27.1%, from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase\nprimarily relates to a $3.0 million impact from the maturity of our prior interest rate swap agreements in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We have entered into a\ncumulative $500.0 million notional new interest rate swap agreements as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which will mature in March 2028. Refer to Note\n7, Derivative Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further\ninformation.\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies: In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in\nexchange for cash proceeds. Following the transaction, we owned approximately 34.7% of Insomnia Cookies and lost the ability to exercise control. Accordingly, we\ndeconsolidated Insomnia Cookies and recorded a gain on divestiture of $87.1 million. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.\nIncome tax expense: Income tax expense was $17.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $24.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease\nof $6.7 million was primarily driven by lower pre-tax results compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, offset by the tax impact of the gain on the divestiture of\nInsomnia Cookies.\nNet (loss)/income attributable to noncontrolling interest: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $2.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, while net\nincome attributable to noncontrolling interest was $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The fluctuation of $2.2 million was driven by losses allocated to\ncertain consolidated subsidiaries, particularly WKS Krispy Kreme.\n39\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations by Segment – Quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the Quarter ended October 1, 2023\nThe following table presents Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated:\nQuarter Ended Change\n(in thousands, except percentages) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 $ %\nU.S. $ 13,922 $ 22,258 $ (8,336) -37.5 %\nInternational 22,779 24,961 (2,182) -8.7 %\nMarket Development 11,271 9,816 1,455 14.8 %\nCorporate (13,273) (13,294) 21 0.2 %\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 34,699 $ 43,741 $ (9,042) -20.7 %\n(1) Refer to “Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures” above for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nU.S. segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $8.3 million, or 37.5%, with margin decline of 250 basis points to 6.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily driven by a decline in operating leverage, incremental vehicle accident claims costs of $2.8 million, and certain McDonald’s start-\nup costs, partially offset by pricing and productivity benefits from Hub and Spoke expansion.\nInternational segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.2 million, or 8.7%, with margin decline of 240 basis points to 17.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared\nto the third quarter of fiscal 2023, as lower transaction volumes continued to impact operating leverage for the International equity markets. International Adjusted\nEBITDA margin improved 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as actions taken to reduce costs delivered improved sequential results.\nMarket Development segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $1.5 million, or 14.8%, with margin expansion of 770 basis points to 54.2% in the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, driven mainly by savings in SG&A and marketing costs, and the continued expansion of our international franchise\nbusiness.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThree Quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the Three Quarters ended October 1, 2023\nThe following table presents our unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024 and the three quarters ended\nOctober 1, 2023:\nThree Quarters Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change\n(in thousands, except percentages) Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue $ %\nNet revenues\nProduct sales $ 1,233,585 97.8 % $ 1,209,767 97.9 % $ 23,818 2.0 %\nRoyalties and other revenues 27,789 2.2 % 25,432 2.1 % 2,357 9.3 %\nTotal net revenues 1,261,374 100.0 % 1,235,199 100.0 % 26,175 2.1 %\nProduct and distribution costs 310,701 24.6 % 330,292 26.7 % (19,591) -5.9 %\nOperating expenses 609,726 48.3 % 575,953 46.6 % 33,773 5.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense 207,150 16.4 % 192,355 15.6 % 14,795 7.7 %\nMarketing expenses 35,211 2.8 % 32,101 2.6 % 3,110 9.7 %\nPre-opening costs 2,691 0.2 % 2,927 0.2 % (236) -8.1 %\nOther income, net (6,430) -0.5 % (6,051) -0.5 % (379) -6.3 %\nDepreciation and amortization expense 99,562 7.9 % 89,142 7.2 % 10,420 11.7 %\nOperating income 2,763 0.2 % 18,480 1.5 % (15,717) -85.0 %\nInterest expense, net 44,468 3.5 % 36,858 3.0 % 7,610 20.6 %\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (87,128) -6.9 % — — % (87,128) -100.0 %\nOther non-operating expense, net 1,115 0.1 % 3,031 0.2 % (1,916) -63.2 %\nIncome/(loss) before income taxes 44,308 3.5 % (21,409) -1.7 % 65,717 307.0 %\nIncome tax expense 18,330 1.5 % 17,121 1.4 % 1,209 7.1 %\nNet income/(loss) 25,978 2.1 % (38,530) -3.1 % 64,508 167.4 %\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest 440 — % 2,005 0.2 % (1,565) -78.1 %\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Krispy Kreme, Inc. $ 25,538 2.0 % $ (40,535) -3.3 % $ 66,073 163.0 %\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a further breakdown of total net revenue and organic revenue growth by segment for the three quarters ended September 29, 2024\ncompared to the three quarters ended October 1, 2023:\nMarket Total\n(in thousands, except percentages) U.S. International Development Company\nTotal net revenues in first three quarters of fiscal 2024 $ 813,615 $ 380,716 $ 67,043 $ 1,261,374\nTotal net revenues in first three quarters of fiscal 2023 808,938 358,653 67,608 1,235,199\nTotal Net Revenues Growth 4,677 22,063 (565) 26,175\nTotal Net Revenues Growth % 0.6 % 6.2 % -0.8 % 2.1 %\nLess: Impact of shop optimization program closures (463) — — (463)\nLess: Impact of Branded Sweet Treats exit (5,853) — — (5,853)\nLess: Impact of Insomnia Cookies divestiture (43,531) — — (43,531)\nAdjusted net revenues in first three quarters of fiscal 2023 759,091 358,653 67,608 1,185,352\nAdjusted net revenue growth 54,524 22,063 (565) 76,022\nImpact of acquisitions (6,228) (1,108) 2,127 (5,209)\nImpact of foreign currency translation — 1,338 — 1,338\nOrganic Revenue Growth $ 48,296 $ 22,293 $ 1,562 $ 72,151\nOrganic Revenue Growth % 6.4 % 6.2 % 2.3 % 6.1 %\nTotal net revenue growth of $26.2 million, or approximately 2.1%, and organic revenue growth of $72.2 million, or approximately 6.1%, was driven by the continued\nand successful execution of our growth strategy deploying our omni-channel approach globally. We have continued to increase availability through 2,417 additional\nGlobal Points of Access, including 2,483 new capital-light DFD Doors, and via digital channels. Additionally, we have continued to take pricing actions to offset cost\ninflation, with average pricing increasing approximately 6%, partially offset by transaction volume declines from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2024.\nOur U.S. segment net revenue grew $4.7 million, or approximately 0.6%, and organic revenue increased $48.3 million, or approximately 6.4%, from the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Growth was driven primarily by 969 additional Points of Access compared to the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2023 and growth in Krispy Kreme branded digital channel revenues of 26%. Our organic growth has been supplemented by effective pricing increases with\naverage pricing increasing approximately 7% from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, leading to an increase in the average\ntransaction size, but partially offset by transaction volume declines.\nOur International segment net revenue grew $22.1 million, or approximately 6.2%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, in\nspite of foreign currency translation impacts of $1.3 million. International organic revenue grew $22.3 million, or approximately 6.2%, from the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, driven primarily by increased pricing of approximately 5% and Points of Access growth of 1,312 compared to the\nfirst three quarters of fiscal 2023. International organic revenue growth was partially offset by the lower transaction volume compared to last year.\nOur Market Development segment net revenue declined $0.6 million, or approximately 0.8%, due to the $2.1 million impact of acquisitions in the third quarter of fiscal\n2024. Market Development organic revenue grew $1.6 million, or approximately 2.3%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal\n2024 due to the continued expansion of our international franchise business.\nProduct and distribution costs (exclusive of depreciation and amortization): Product and distribution costs decreased $19.6 million, or 5.9%, from the first three quarters\nof fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, product and distribution costs decreased by approximately 210 basis points from\n26.7% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 24.6% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily due to benefits from pricing actions taken to offset materials\ncost inflation of approximately 4%. Additionally, we benefited from the exit of the lower-margin Branded Sweet Treats business, and lapping the related $10.4 million\ninventory write-offs and employee severance expenses incurred during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023.\n42\nTable of Contents\nOperating expenses: Operating expenses increased $33.8 million, or 5.9%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, driven\nmainly by labor cost inflation of approximately 5% and investments to support growth, with shop and delivery labor expenses increasing $20.8 million. Operating\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue increased approximately 170 basis points, from 46.6% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 48.3% in the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2024, primarily due to the impact of lower transaction volumes on operating leverage. This has been partially offset by efficiency benefits from Hub and Spoke\nexpansion.\nSelling, general and administrative expense: SG&A expense increased $14.8 million, or 7.7%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense increased approximately 80 basis points, from 15.6% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to 16.4% in the\nfirst three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by $14.2 million related to preparing for and executing the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies (including share-based\ncompensation expenses), partially offset by lower employee cash incentive compensation by $7.6 million and cost control initiatives in the first three quarters of fiscal\n2024.\nOther income, net: Other income, net of $6.4 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was driven by a gain of $5.6 million related to the remeasurement of equity\nmethod investments to fair value immediately prior to the acquisition of Krispy Kreme shops referenced in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Other income, net of $6.1 million in the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2023 was primarily driven by a gain on a sale-leaseback transaction of $9.6 million, partially offset by property, plant and equipment impairments associated with\nthe exit of the Branded Sweet Treats business.\nDepreciation and amortization expense: Depreciation and amortization expense increased $10.4 million, or 11.7%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first\nthree quarters of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately 70 basis points, from 7.2% in the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2023 to 7.9% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by higher capital spend and assets placed into service to support the Hub and\nSpoke model evolution, including preparing for the acceleration of our U.S. national DFD rollout discussed in “Significant Events and Transactions” above.\nInterest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased $7.6 million, or 20.6%, from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. The\nincrease was primarily driven by a higher average debt balance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 and also includes a $3.0 million impact from the maturity of our\nprior interest rate swap agreements in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We have entered into a cumulative $500.0 million notional new interest rate swap agreements as\nof the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which will mature in March 2028.\nGain on divestiture of Insomnia Cookies: In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlling interest in Insomnia Cookies in\nexchange for cash proceeds. Following the transaction, we owned approximately 34.7% of Insomnia Cookies and lost the ability to exercise control. Accordingly, we\ndeconsolidated Insomnia Cookies and recorded a gain on divestiture of $87.1 million. Refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.\nIncome tax expense: Income tax expense was $18.3 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, while income tax expense was $17.1 million in the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2023. The fluctuation of $1.2 million from the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower\npre-tax results compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, offset by the tax impact of the gain on the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies.\n43\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations by Segment – Three Quarters ended September 29, 2024 compared to the Three Quarters ended October 1, 2023\nThe following table presents Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the periods indicated:\nThree Quarters Ended Change\n(in thousands, except percentages) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 $ %\nU.S. $ 89,206 $ 88,878 $ 328 0.4 %\nInternational 64,970 68,645 (3,675) -5.4 %\nMarket Development 36,046 31,862 4,184 13.1 %\nCorporate (42,609) (41,902) (707) -1.7 %\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 147,613 $ 147,483 $ 130 0.1 %\n(1) Refer to “Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures” above for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nU.S. segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.3 million, or 0.4%, with margin flat at 11.0% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters\nof fiscal 2023, as benefits from lapping the exited Branded Sweet Treats business, productivity benefits from Hub and Spoke expansion, and lower employee cash\nincentive compensation were offset by impacts from lower transaction volume on operating leverage and incremental vehicle accident claims costs.\nInternational segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $3.7 million, or 5.4%, with margin decline of 200 basis points to 17.1% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024\ncompared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, as lower transaction volume continued to impact operating leverage for the International equity markets.\nMarket Development segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.2 million, or 13.1%, with margin expansion of 670 basis points to 53.8% in the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, driven mainly by savings in SG&A and the continued expansion of our international franchise business.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur principal sources of liquidity to date have included cash from operating activities, cash on hand, amounts available under our credit facility, vendor financing\nincluding our SCF programs and structured payables programs, and proceeds from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies. Our primary use of liquidity is to fund the cash\nrequirements of our business operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other commitments.\nOur future obligations primarily consist of our debt and lease obligations, as well as commitments under ingredient and other forward purchase contracts. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had the following future obligations:\n• An aggregate principal amount of $837.5 million outstanding under the 2023 Facility;\n• An aggregate principal amount of $11.0 million outstanding under short-term, uncommitted lines of credit;\n• Non-cancellable future minimum operating lease payments totaling $759.2 million;\n• Non-cancellable future minimum finance lease payments totaling $63.3 million; and\n• Purchase commitments under ingredient and other forward purchase contracts of $130.5 million.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the principal amount outstanding under our 2023 Facility was $798.8 million. The decrease from the 2023 Facility balance as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was driven by our use of a portion of the proceeds from the divestiture of Insomnia Cookies to pay down outstanding balances associated with the\n2023 Facility. Refer to Note 9, Long-Term Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor further information.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $25.4 million and $38.2 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe that our existing cash\nand cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve\nmonths. Our assessment of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations could vary because of, and our future\ncapital requirements will depend on, many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending on business acquisitions, the growth of our presence in\nnew markets, and the expansion of our omni-channel model in existing markets. We may enter into arrangements in the future to acquire or invest in complementary\nbusinesses, services, and technologies. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner\nthan we currently expect. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may\nnot be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise\ncapitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\n45\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nWe typically generate cash from operations and have substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital\nexpenditures and debt repayments. Our requirement for working capital is not significant because our consumers pay us in cash or on debit or credit cards at the time of\nthe sale and we are able to sell many of our inventory items before payment is due to the vendor of such items. The following table and discussion present, for the\nperiods indicated, a summary of our key cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities:\nThree Quarters Ended\n(in thousands) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 18,787 $ 44,032\nNet cash provided by/(used for) investing activities 44,745 (78,358)\nNet cash (used for)/provided by financing activities (77,348) 27,533\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operations totaled $18.8 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $25.2 million compared with the first three quarters of fiscal\n2023. This decrease was primarily due to less operating income generated in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, as\nwell as our receipt of $7.7 million cash proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swap derivative contracts in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 discussed in Note\n7, Derivative Instruments to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities totaled $44.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a fluctuation of $123.1 million compared with the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2023. The cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of $117.6 million from the divestiture of Insomnia\nCookies and an additional $45.0 million from the repayment of an intercompany loan due from Insomnia Cookies in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. These\nproceeds were partially offset by our use of $26.6 million cash for the acquisition of franchised shops in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, discussed in Note 2,\nAcquisitions and Divestitures to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nWe expect to incur additional capital expenditures related to our accelerated U.S. expansion, including via QSR channels such as the McDonald’s U.S. national rollout\ndiscussed in “Significant Events and Transactions” above. We plan to support much of this expansion using existing capacity, and do not expect a significant increase in\ncapital expenditures as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2024. While we do expect U.S. capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues to increase in fiscal 2025 and\n2026 associated with acceleration of the overall U.S. business expansion, these capital expenditures support the overall DFD and retail channels and are not directly\nattributable to, or required by, the agreement with McDonald’s. We are not subject to capital expenditure commitments or obligations specific to the relationship with\nMcDonald’s.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used for financing activities totaled $77.3 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024, a fluctuation of $104.9 million compared with the first three quarters of\nfiscal 2023. The cash used for financing activities was primarily driven by the pay down of long term debt balances with a portion of the net proceeds received from the\ndivestiture of Insomnia Cookies.\nProceeds from our structured payables resulted in a net $48.7 million change in cash flows (net proceeds from structured payables of $34.2 million in the first three\nquarters of fiscal 2024 compared to net payments on structured payables of $14.5 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2023). The proceeds from structured\npayables in the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 primarily related to our purchase of all shares held by the noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated subsidiary\nAwesome Doughnut. Refer to Note 8, Vendor Finance Programs to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for further information.\n46\nTable of Contents\nDebt\nOur long-term debt obligations consist of the following:\n(in thousands) September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n2023 Facility — term loan $ 656,250 $ 682,500\n2023 Facility — revolving credit facility 142,500 155,000\nShort-term lines of credit 2,500 11,000\nLess: Debt issuance costs (3,584) (4,371)\nFinance lease obligations 54,549 47,117\nTotal long-term debt 852,215 891,246\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt (47,577) (54,631)\nLong-term debt, less current portion $ 804,638 $ 836,615\n2023 Secured Credit Facility\nThe 2023 Facility consists of a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a term loan with an original principal amount of $700.0 million. Refer to Note\n9, Long-Term Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information.\nUnder the terms of the 2023 Facility, we are subject to a requirement to maintain a leverage ratio of less than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the end of each quarterly Test Period (as\ndefined in the 2023 Facility) through maturity in March 2028. The leverage ratio under the 2023 Facility is defined as the ratio of (a) Total Indebtedness (as defined in\nthe 2023 Facility, which includes all debt and finance lease obligations) minus unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to (b) a defined calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\n(2023 Facility Adjusted EBITDA) for the most recently ended Test Period. Our leverage ratio was 3.51 to 1.00 as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared\nto 3.48 to 1.00 as of the end of fiscal 2023.\nWe were in compliance with the financial covenants related to the 2023 Facility as of September 29, 2024 and expect to remain in compliance over the next 12 months.\nIf we are unable to meet the 2023 Facility financial or other covenants in future periods, it may negatively impact our liquidity by limiting our ability to draw on the\nrevolving credit facility, could result in the lenders accelerating the maturity of such indebtedness and foreclosing upon the collateral pledged thereunder, and could\nrequire the replacement of the 2023 Facility with new sources of financing, which there is no guaranty we could secure.\nShort-Term Lines of Credit\nWe are party to two agreements with existing lenders providing for short-term, uncommitted lines of credit up to $25.0 million. Borrowings under these short-term lines\nof credit are payable to the lenders on a revolving basis for tenors up to a maximum of three months and are subject to an interest rate of adjusted term SOFR plus a\ncredit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus a margin of 1.75%.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in\nconformity with GAAP. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires the use of judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses as well as related disclosures. We consider an accounting judgment, estimate, or assumption to be critical\nwhen (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates, and assumptions could\nhave a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ from the estimates made by management.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n47\nTable of Contents\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of\nPart I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.\n48\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nEffects of Changing Prices – Inflation\nWe are exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of ingredients of our products, of which flour, sugar, and shortening are the most significant.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we have continued to experience headwinds from commodity inflation globally. We have undertaken efforts to effectively\nmanage inflationary cost increases through rapid inventory turnover and reduced inventory waste, increased focus on resiliency of our supply chains, and an ability to\nadjust pricing of our products. Additionally, from time to time we may enter into forward contracts for supply through our vendors for raw materials which are\ningredients of our products or which are components of such ingredients, including wheat, sugar, and soybean oil.\nWe are also exposed to the effects of commodity price fluctuations in the cost of gasoline used by our delivery vehicles. To mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price\nof our fuel purchases, we may directly purchase commodity futures contracts.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates on any borrowings under our debt facilities, which bear interest based on the one-month SOFR (with a floor of zero).\nGenerally, interest rate changes could impact the amount of our interest paid and, therefore, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.\nTo mitigate the impact of changes in SOFR on interest expense for a portion of our variable rate debt, we have entered into interest rate swaps on $500.0 million\nnotional of our $801.3 million of outstanding debt under the 2023 Facility and short-term lines of credit as of September 29, 2024, which we account for as cash flow\nhedges. The interest rate swap agreements are scheduled to mature in March 2028. Based on the $301.3 million of unhedged outstanding as of September 29, 2024, a\n100 basis point increase or decrease in the one-month SOFR would result in a $3.0 million increase or decrease, respectively, in interest expense for a 12-month period,\nbased on the daily average of the one-month SOFR for the quarter ended September 29, 2024\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency translation risk on the operations of our subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, whose revenues\naccounted for approximately 30% of our total net revenues through the three quarters ended September 29, 2024. A substantial majority of these revenues, or\napproximately $380.7 million through the three quarters ended September 29, 2024, were attributable to subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the Canadian\ndollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Japanese yen. A 10% increase or decrease in the\naverage exchange rate of the Canadian dollar, the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Japanese yen\nagainst the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease or increase of approximately $38.1 million in our total net revenues for the three quarters ended September 29,\n2024.\nFrom time to time, we engage in foreign currency exchange and credit transactions with our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which we typically hedge. To date, the impact of\nsuch transactions, including the cost of hedging, has not been material. We do not engage in foreign currency or hedging transactions for speculative purposes.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer\n(“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of September 29, 2024, we completed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThere were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of conducting our business, we have in the past and may in the future become involved in various legal actions and other claims. We may also\nbecome involved in other judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Some of these\nmatters may involve claims of substantial amounts. These legal proceedings may be subject to many uncertainties and there can be no assurance of the outcome of any\nindividual proceedings.

The words “believe,” “may,” “focus,” “expand,” “continuing,” “guidance,”\n“could,” “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “working towards” or similar words, or the negative of these words, identify\nforward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and estimates that we consider reasonable but are subject to\nvarious risks and uncertainties relating to our operations, financial results, financial conditions, business, prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Accordingly, there\nare and may be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. The inclusion of this forward-\nlooking information should not be regarded as a representation by us that the future plans, estimates or expectations contemplated by us will be achieved. Our\nactual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements included herein. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in\nforward-looking statements include, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties described under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements” and “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) and described in the other filings we make from time to time with the SEC. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, the impact of\npandemics, changes in consumer preferences, the impact of inflation, and our ability to execute on our omni-channel business strategy. These forward-looking\nstatements are made only as of the date of this document, and we do not undertake any obligation, other than as may be required by applicable law, to update\nor revise any forward-looking or cautionary statement to reflect changes in assumptions, the occurrence of events, unanticipated or otherwise, or changes in future\noperating results over time or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including organic revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Diluted, Adjusted Diluted\nEPS, Net Debt, Fresh Revenue from Hubs with Spokes and Sales per Hub, which differ from results using U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not universally consistent calculations, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Other companies may calculate\nsimilarly titled financial measures differently than we do or may not calculate them at all. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of\nfinancial performance under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed with the SEC.\nPlease see the Earnings Press Release filed with the SEC on November 7, 2024 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and additional information for\nmetrics in the accompanying slides. All metrics are as of September 29, 2024, unless stated otherwise.\nThe Company does not provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts\noutside of the Company’s control on certain items, such as net income and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which,\nbased on historical experience, could be significant.\nKrispy Kreme | 3Q24 Earnings\n2\nKrispy Kreme | 3Q24 Earnings\n3\nA BIGGER AND\nBETTER KRISPY KREME\nBIGGER:\n• Profitable U.S. DFD expansion\n• Capital
