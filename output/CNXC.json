(2) As described in the non-GAAP reconciliations included in the accompanying financial tables, the reported amounts for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for all periods include adjustments to exclude foreign currency losses (gains), net, which were not adjusted in similar non-GAAP measures previously reported for the prior period.\n\n**Third****Quarter Fiscal****2024****Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenue of $2,387.4 million, an increase of 46.2% year-on-year compared to revenue of $1,632.8 million in the prior year third quarter. The Company grew revenue 2.6% year-on-year on a pro forma constant currency basis.\n  * Operating income of $153.2 million, or 6.4% of revenue, compared to $162.3 million, or 9.9% of revenue, in the prior year third quarter, a reduction year-on-year primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles and planned integration expenses associated with the Company's combination with Webhelp, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income of $331.0 million, or 13.9% of revenue, compared to $231.0 million, or 14.1% of revenue in the prior year third quarter.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $388.1 million, or 16.3% of revenue, compared with $269.3 million, or 16.5% of revenue in the prior year third quarter.\n  * Cash flow from operations was $191.6 million in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was $135.3 million in the quarter.\n  * Diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) was $0.25 compared to $1.49 in the prior year third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to increased amortization of intangibles and planned integration expenses associated with the Company's combination with Webhelp, which closed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.87 compared to $2.76 in the prior year third quarter.\n\n\n\nThe Company also announced today the launch of iX Hello, a Generative AI-powered solution for organizations to boost productivity and engagement within an on-brand, secure environment. iX Hello marks the first product launch in a suite of AI and GenAI technologies which the Company has already successfully deployed internally and with pre-launch clients. Further details of the product launch can be found in today’s [_separate press release_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PmrRnNyDY5qIKrOVur6BkSAyAwuNCnNmJDTRlaLXscJwrUt54JGlaVIyGKcK-w2Wnr4ASCn6xoxH57d-pBnOFgeQTlEN1mXOXNR7NGHEhDBGj04nSwgVgWJM89o3x0uF).\n\n“Our third quarter marked another quarter of solid revenue growth and operating results,” said Chris Caldwell, President and CEO of Concentrix. “We are also delighted to leverage our technology investments to bring our iX Hello product to market with velocity. We believe iX Hello helps augment our existing technology partner strategies, underscores the positive transformation of our business and reflects our strong competitive position as the world’s most trusted provider of intelligent experience solutions.”\n\n**Quarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase Program:**\n\n  * The Company paid a $0.3025 per share quarterly dividend on August 6, 2024. The Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.33275 per share payable on November 5, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 25, 2024.\n  * The Company repurchased 0.6 million shares in the third quarter at a cost of $39.1 million under its previously announced share repurchase program at an average cost of $64.89 per share. At August 31, 2024, the Company’s remaining share repurchase authorization was $188.0 million.\n\n\n\n**Business Outlook** The following statements are based on the Company’s current expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the full year fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, share-based compensation, and the related tax effects thereon. The non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes no impact from changes in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.\n\n_Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Expectations:_\n\n  * Fourth quarter reported revenue of $2.420 billion to $2.470 billion. Based on current exchange rates, these expectations assume an approximately 60-basis point positive impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year period. The guidance implies pro forma constant currency revenue for the quarter ranging from a decrease of 0.5% to growth of 1.5%.\n  * Operating income of $160 million to $166 million and non-GAAP operating income of $335 million to $355 million.\n  * Non-GAAP EPS of $2.90 to $3.16, assuming approximately 64.5 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 3.7% of net income attributable to participating securities.\n  * The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%.\n\n\n\n_Full Year Fiscal 2024 Expectations:_\n\n  * Full year reported revenue of $9.591 billion to $9.641 billion. Based on current exchange rates, the expectations assume an approximately 110-basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year. The guidance implies pro forma constant currency revenue growth for the full year of 2.2% to 2.7%.\n  * Operating income of $611 million to $617 million and non-GAAP operating income of $1,306 million to $1,326 million.\n  * Non-GAAP EPS of $11.05 to $11.31, assuming approximately 65.1 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 3.6% of net income attributable to participating securities.\n  * The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24.4% to 24.7%.\n\n\n\nThe Company said it expects adjusted free cash flow of $625 million to $650 million for fiscal 2024. The Company expects to repurchase approximately $30 million of its common stock over the final quarter of the year for total share repurchases of more than $130 million for fiscal 2024, an increase from the Company’s previous commitment.\n\nThe Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the non-GAAP EPS outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to (a) the inability to forecast future changes in acquisition contingent consideration, which is based, in part, on the future trading price of the Company’s common stock, and (b) the inability to forecast future foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. For the same reason, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which may have a material impact on the Company’s GAAP results.\n\nThe Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the adjusted free cash flow outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to uncertainty related to the future changes in the Company’s factoring program and related timing of those changes. For the same reason, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which may have a material impact on the Company’s GAAP results.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast** The Company will host a conference call for investors to review its third quarter fiscal 2024 results today _at 5:00 p.m. (ET)/2:00 p.m. (PT)._\n\nThe live conference call webcast will be available in listen-only mode in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website under “Events and Presentations” at [https://ir.concentrix.com/events-and-presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dxMpEdZBQeEzdaOA-PAdIIbrCHrhXvMPMEuw2lKucCbGLYjOAgic8RRJa_diVjnzdDUkSCVIkoRq6xnV8Pv8ZvNj1CXoRVOgnlDFlMPDO5MJjJ5Pd1XtCZCxIJOUxgtfakyU75fAkFb8EoRbuWZdeWty6a9tlNomzLIVroC43R8=).

Visit concentrix.com to learn more.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Information** In addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information, including:\n\n  * Constant currency revenue growth, which is revenue growth adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Constant currency revenue growth is calculated by translating the revenue of each fiscal year in the billing currency to U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year’s currency conversion rate in comparison to prior year’s revenue. Generally, when the U.S. dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, revenue growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than revenue growth reported at actual exchange rates.\n  * Pro forma constant currency revenue growth, which is constant currency revenue growth measured against the Company’s combined pro forma results of operations as if the combination with Webhelp had occurred on December 1, 2022.\n  * Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation.\n  * Non-GAAP operating margin, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, divided by revenue.\n  * Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, plus depreciation (exclusive of step-up depreciation).\n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.\n  * Non-GAAP net income, which is net income excluding the tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers’ note issued in connection with the combination with Webhelp (the “sellers’ note”), change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP net income also excludes the income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity.\n  * Free cash flow, which is cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow excluding the effect of changes in the outstanding factoring balance. We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows because it removes the effect of factoring which changes the timing of the receipt of cash for certain receivables. However, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow have limitations because they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not incorporate payments for business acquisitions.\n  * Non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is diluted EPS excluding the per share, tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers’ note, change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP EPS also excludes the per share income tax effect of certain legal entity restructuring activity. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net income attributable to participating securities and the related per share, tax-effected impact of adjustments to net income described above reflect only those amounts that are attributable to common shareholders.\n\n\n\nWe believe that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand our base operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets. Although intangible assets contribute to our revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the services performed for our clients. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of our acquisition activity. Accordingly, we believe excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance, enhances our and our investors’ ability to compare our past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude share-based compensation expense. Given the subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when calculating share-based compensation expense, management believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of our peers.

in these amounts are a) bridge financing fees expensed and interest expenses associated with the senior notes, net of interest earnings on invested proceeds incurred in advance of the Webhelp Combination and b) expenses associated with non-designated call option contracts put in place to hedge foreign exchange movements in connection with the Webhelp Combination that are included within interest expense and finance charges, net and other expense (income), net, respectively, in the consolidated statement of operations.\n\n(2) The tax effect of taxable and deductible non-GAAP adjustments was calculated using the tax-deductible portion of the expenses and applying the entity-specific, statutory tax rates applicable to each item during the respective periods presented.\n\n(3) Diluted EPS is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation proportional to the respective ownership among holders of common stock and participating securities. Restricted stock awards, and effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, certain restricted stock units granted to employees are considered participating securities. For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, net income attributable to participating securities was approximately 3.4% and 1.7% of net income, respectively, for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 and 3.6% and 1.7% of net income, respectively, for the nine months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, and was excluded from total net income to calculate net income attributable to common stockholders. In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments allocated to common stockholders were calculated based on the percentage of net income attributable to common stockholders.\n\n(4) Foreign currency losses (gains), net are included in other expense (income), net and primarily consist of gains and losses recognized on the revaluation and settlement of foreign currency transactions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. The reported amounts for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the three- and nine- months ended August 31, 2024 include adjustments to exclude these foreign currency losses (gains), net, which were not adjusted in similar non-GAAP measures previously reported for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023.
