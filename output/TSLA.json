We released Actually Smart\nSummon, which enables your vehicle to autonomously drive to you in parking lots, and FSD 0.8\n(Supervised) to Cybertruck customers, including end-to-end neural nets for highway driving\n0.4\nfor the first time. We deployed and are training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at\n0.0\nGigafactory Texas – where we expect to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.\nVehicle and Other Software\nCumulative miles driven with FSD (Supervised) (billions)\nOur Summer Release included YouTube and Amazon Music as native apps.

Cybercab will be built on our\nnext-generation platform which includes a new powertrain with an estimated 5.5 mi/kWh.\nThis will be our most efficient powertrain yet. In Q3, we produced our 100-millionth 4680 cell\nTesla AI training capacity ramp through end of year (H100 equivalent GPUs)\nand continued to progress our dry-cathode manufacturing lines.\n(1)Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous\n8\nO T H E R H I G H L I G H T S\nOur Energy and Services and Other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of 1,000\nTesla.

Powerwall achieved record deployments in -800\n-1,000\nQ3 for the second quarter in a row. Ramp of Powerwall 3 and the Lathrop Megafactory\ncontinued successfully – with Lathrop demonstrating 200 Megapack production (40 GWh\nannual run rate) in a single week. As of Q3, over 100,000 Powerwalls were enrolled in Virtual\nEnergy and Services and Other gross profit ($M)\nPower Plant programs, delivering additional financial value to owners while providing much-\nneeded support to the grid during periods of stress. The Shanghai Megafactory remains on\n10\ntrack to begin shipping Megapacks in Q1 2025.\n9\n8\n7\nServices and Other\n6\n5\nThe Services and Other business achieved a record gross profit in Q3, growing over 90% 4\n3\nyear-on-year. Sequential growth in gross profit was driven mostly by higher gross profit\n2\ngeneration from supercharging, service center margin improvement and higher gross profit\n1\ngeneration from Parts Sales and Merchandise. Our Supercharger network continued to\n0\nexpand in Q3 with over 2,800 new stalls in the quarter, a 22% growth of the network YoY.\nEnergy Storage deployments (GWh)\n9\nO U T L O O K\nVolume Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform\nand we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our\nnext generation vehicle platform. Despite ongoing macroeconomic conditions, we expect to achieve slight growth in vehicle\ndeliveries in 2024. Energy storage deployments are expected to more than double year-over-year in 2024.\nCash We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we\nwill manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.\nProfit While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our\nhardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.\nProduct Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These\nvehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced\non the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.\nThis approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle\nvolumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum\ncapacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new\nmanufacturing lines.\nOur purpose-built Robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary “unboxed” manufacturing strategy.\n10\nP H O T O S & C H A R T S\nE L E C T R I C V E H I C L E A D O P T I O N R A T

This webcast will also be available for replay for approximately one year thereafter.\nCERTAIN TERMS\nWhen used in this update, certain terms have the following meanings. Our vehicle deliveries include only vehicles that have been transferred to end customers with all paperwork correctly completed. Our energy product deployment volume\nincludes both customer units when installed and equipment sales at time of delivery. \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is equal to (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii)(a) interest expense, (b) provision for income taxes, (c)\ndepreciation, amortization and impairment and (d) stock-based compensation expense. \"Free cash flow\" is operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Average cost per vehicle is cost of automotive sales divided by new vehicle deliveries\n(excluding operating leases). “Days sales outstanding” is equal to (i) average accounts receivable, net for the period divided by (ii) total revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days payable outstanding” is equal to (i)\naverage accounts payable for the period divided by (ii) total cost of revenues and multiplied by (iii) the number of days in the period. “Days of supply” is calculated by dividing new car ending inventory by the relevant quarter’s deliveries and\nusing 75 trading days. Constant currency impacts are calculated by comparing actuals against current results converted into USD using average exchange rates from the prior period.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement our consolidated financial results. Our non-GAAP financial measures include non-GAAP net income (loss)\nattributable to common stockholders, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for GAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to Tesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating\nresults of other companies. Management believes that it is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial\nplanning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the\neyes of Tesla management regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing investors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of\naccounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information\nis provided above.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements in this update, including, but not limited to, statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the development, strategy, ramp, production and capacity, demand and market growth, cost, pricing and profitability,\ninvestment, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and services; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and\nstatements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at our factories are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on assumptions and management’s current expectations, involve certain risks and uncertainties, and are not guarantees. Future results may differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. The following\nimportant factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the risk of delays in launching and/or manufacturing our products, services and features cost-effectively; our\nability to build and/or grow our products and services, sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging capabilities and effectively manage this growth; our ability to successfully and timely develop, introduce and scale, as well as our\nconsumers’ demand for, products and services based on artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, electric vehicles, Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features, and ride-hailing services generally and our vehicles and services specifically;\nthe ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes acceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at\nour factories; our ability to ramp our factories in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of battery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any failures by Tesla products to\nperform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competition in the automotive, transportation and energy product and services markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-\nterm business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to attract, hire and retain key\nemployees and qualified personnel; our ability to maintain the security of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations and laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve\nfrom time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness and financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential factors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities\nand Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on January 26, 2024 and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nTesla disclaims any obligation to update information contained in these forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n31"

We deployed 4,053 MWh of energy storage products in Q1, the highest quarterly deployment yet.\n\nDecline in volumes was partially due to the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory and factory shutdowns resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin.\n\n**Production** | **Deliveries** | **Subject to operating lease accounting**  \n---|---|---  \nModel 3/Y | 412,376 | 369,783 | 2%  \nOther Models | 20,995 | 17,027 | 1%  \n**Total** | 433,371 | 386,810 | **2%**  \n  \n***\n\nTesla will post its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 after market close on Tuesday, April 23, 2024.

The event will be held at:\n\nTesla, Inc. 1 Tesla Road Austin, TX 78725\n\nTo maximize fairness, we are conducting a random drawing to determine our stockholders’ eligibility to attend the meeting in person. The deadline for entry is Monday, May 13, 2024, at 11:59 PM Central Time.\n\nIf you are selected through the drawing, your selection is further subject to confirmation of your identity in the form of valid government-issued identification. Selections are non-transferable. Please carefully review the [2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting Drawing Terms](/2024-meeting-terms \"View\").\n\nWe expect to begin communicating attendee selections during the week of May 20, 2024.\n\n## [Virtual Meeting ]()\n\nWe are providing any stockholder as of April 15, 2024, with the means to join the 2024 Annual Stockholder Meeting virtually at <http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/TSLA2024>. The virtual meeting will feature the same livestream accessible to the public, plus the option to submit votes and written comments on meeting agenda items. To join the virtual meeting, you will need a 16-digit secure “control number” unique to you, which you can obtain as follows: \n\n  * If you are a “stockholder of record” with shares registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (a minority of Tesla stockholders), you can find the control number on the Notice of Internet Availability or paper proxy card that was sent to you.\n  * If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name: \n    * The voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany these proxy materials will tell you how to use the Internet or telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account.\n    * If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete, and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail.\n\n\n"
