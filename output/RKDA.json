Schaefer, Arcadia’s president and CEO. “Our total revenues increased 18 percent year over year, and we have significantly reduced our use of operating cash to the lowest levels in Arcadia’s history as a public company. \n\n“Zola® coconut water revenues grew 55 percent in Q3, and new retail distribution increased 68 percent compared to last year. Additionally, Zola is gaining market share and growing faster than the coconut water category across all measured time periods,” Schaefer said. \n\n**Arcadia Biosciences, Inc.** **Financial Snapshot** **(Unaudited)** _($ in thousands)_  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Nine Months****Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Favorable / (Unfavorable)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Favorable / (Unfavorable)**  \n**$** |  **%** |  **$** |  **%**  \n**Total revenues** |  1,537  |  1,298  |  239  |  18  |  %  |  3,829  |  3,677  |  152  |  4  |  %   \n**Total operating expenses** |  3,297  |  2,695  |  (602  |  )  |  (22  |  %)  |  5,198  |  8,586  |  3,388  |  39  |  %   \n**Loss from continuing operations** |  (1,760  |  )  |  (1,397  |  )  |  (363  |  )  |  (26  |  %)  |  (1,369  |  )  |  (4,909  |  )  |  3,540  |  72  |  %   \n**Net loss attributable to common stockholders** |  (1,612  |  )  |  (2,567  |  )  |  955  |  37  |  %  |  (2,974  |  )  |  (11,128  |  )  |  8,154  |  73  |  %   \n  \nCertain previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Reclassifications are related to the presentation of the financial results of our former GoodWheatTM and body care brands as discontinued operations. The financial information above and narrative that follows relate to continuing operations unless stated otherwise. \n\nMore detailed financial statements are included in the Form 8-K filed today, available in the Investors section of the company’s website under [SEC Filings](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.arcadiabio.com%2Ffinancial-information%2Fsec-filings&esheet=54151591&newsitemid=20241112069104&lan=en-US&anchor=SEC+Filings&index=2&md5=c3b8c962a5fdc052e0f9ee312e17adc5). \n\n**Revenues**\n\nRevenue increased $239,000 and $152,000 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 driven by an increase in Zola sales. \n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\nOperating expenses increased by $602,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily driven by higher revenues and employee severance costs. Operating expenses decreased by $3.4 million during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by a gain of $4.0 million related to the asset sale to Corteva in 2024. \n\nCost of revenues increased $214,000 and $140,000 during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively, driven by higher revenues and input costs. \n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $379,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to employee severance expenses related to the change in management. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $451,000 during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to employee severance expenses as well as higher consulting and legal expenses. \n\n**Net Loss Attributable to Common Stockholders**\n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.6 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to $2.6 million, or $1.89 per share, for the same period in 2023. The improvement in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by the year-over-year decrease in net loss from discontinued operations. \n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 was $3.0 million, or $2.18 per share, an $8.1 million improvement from the $11.1 million, or $9.31 per share, net loss for same period in 2023. The improvement in net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by the $4.0 million gain related to the asset sale to Corteva in 2024 as well as the year-over-year decrease in net loss from discontinued operations. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nThe company has scheduled a conference call for 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss third-quarter results and key strategic achievements.

Schaefer, president and CEO. “We monetized our wheat IP through two transactions: selling our resistant starch wheat trait to a wholly owned subsidiary of Corteva Agriscience for $4 million; and selling our GoodWheatTM brand to Above Food for net payments of $4 million over the next three years. In addition, we’ve secured significant distribution gains for Zola® coconut water and launched two new flavors and are positioned to grow faster than the category and gain market share.” \n\n“Over the last two years, we’ve exited several underperforming brands, right sized the organization and streamlined our cost structure in order to extend our runway. While we continue to explore strategic alternatives, our focus for the remainder of the year remains on reducing our operating costs and accelerating growth in Zola,” Schaefer said. \n\n**Recent Operating and Business Highlights**\n\n  * Arcadia Sells Resistant Starch Durum Trait to Corteva Agriscience. In May 2024, Arcadia sold its non-GMO Resistant Starch (RS) Durum trait to longtime partner Corteva Agriscience. Arcadia and Corteva began collaborating in 2017 to develop and commercialize RS Durum in North America, and this transaction allowed Arcadia to advance the monetization of its wheat technology with a one-time payment of $4 million. \n  * Arcadia Sells GoodWheat Brand to Above Food Corp. Also in Q2, Above Food Corp acquired the GoodWheat brand of better-for-you wheat products from Arcadia for $4 million in net payments over the next three years. The GoodWheat brand was launched in 2018 to help consumers get more fiber in their diets by increasing the amount of fiber in the delicious foods they love, using Arcadia’s patented non-GMO wheat grain that is naturally higher in fiber and protein. \n  * Zola Coconut Water Ships New Flavors and Increases Sales. Distribution gains for Zola continued as the new pineapple and lime flavors began shipping in Q2. Zola sales outperformed the coconut water category, with year over year sales increasing 42%. \n  * Arcadia Announces CEO Transition. Following the recent departure of Stan Jacot, Thomas J. Schaefer was appointed president and CEO of Arcadia.

Revenue decreased $86,000 during the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by a decrease in GLA sales despite an increase in Zola sales year over year. \n\n**Operating Expenses**\n\nOperating expenses decreased by $3.4 million and $4.0 million during the second quarter and first half of 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, respectively, driven by a gain of $4.0 million related to the asset sale to Corteva Agriscience in 2024. \n\nCost of revenues decreased $17,000 and $74,000 during the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 driven by a decrease in freight cost. \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $609,000 and $74,000 during the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to higher consulting and legal expenses associated with the Corteva and Above Food transactions in 2024. \n\n**Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders**\n\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 million, or $0.78 per share, compared to $823,000, or $0.61 per share, for the same period in 2023. The improvement was primarily driven by the year over year decrease in net loss from discontinued operations. \n\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders for the first half of 2024 was $1.4 million, or $1.00 per share, a $7.2 million improvement from the $8.6 million, or $7.70 per share, net loss for same period in 2023.
