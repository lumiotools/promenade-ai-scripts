I want to thank the entire First Internet team for their contribution towards our strong results and continued success.” \n\n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the section below entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" \n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $21.3 million, compared to $20.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $18.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $22.5 million, compared to $21.9 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $19.5 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nTotal interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $71.0 million, an increase of 4.1% compared to the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of 22.1% compared to the second quarter of 2023. On a fully-taxable equivalent basis, total interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $72.1 million, an increase of 4.0% compared to the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of 21.3% compared to the second quarter of 2023. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the second quarter of 2024 increased to 5.54% from 5.45% for the first quarter of 2024, due to a 10 basis point (“bp”) increase in the yield earned on loans and a 21 bp increase in the yield earned on securities, partially offset by an 11 bp decrease in the yield earned on other earning assets. Compared to the linked quarter, average loan balances, including loans held-for-sale, increased $44.1 million, or 1.1%, while the average balance of securities increased $41.0 million, or 5.8%, and the average balance of other earning assets increased $34.9 million, or 8.0%. \n\nInterest income earned on commercial loans was higher due primarily to increased average balances within the construction, small business lending and franchise finance portfolios. This was partially offset by lower average balances in the investor commercial real estate, public finance and healthcare finance portfolios. The continued shift in the loan mix reflects the Company’s focus on variable rate and higher-yielding products, in part, to help improve the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet. \n\nIn the consumer loan portfolio, interest income was up due to the combination of slightly higher average balances and higher yields in the trailers, recreational vehicles and other consumer loan portfolios. \n\nThe yield on funded portfolio loan originations was 8.88% in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4 bps compared to the first quarter of 2024, and an increase of 46 bps compared to the second quarter of 2023. \n\nInterest income earned on securities during the second quarter of 2024 increased $0.8 million, or 11.8%, compared to the first quarter of 2024 as the yield on the portfolio increased 21 bps to 4.02%, driven primarily by higher yields on new purchases. Interest income earned on other earning asset balances increased $0.4 million, or 5.8%, in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to higher average cash balances, partially offset by lower yields. \n\nTotal interest expense for the second quarter of 2024 was $49.6 million, an increase of $2.2 million, or 4.6%, compared to the linked quarter as short-term rates remained stable throughout the quarter while average interest-bearing deposit balances increased $186.0 million, or 4.7%. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits increased $2.4 million, or 5.6%, driven primarily by certificates of deposits (“CDs”), interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and BaaS-brokered deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was 4.29% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 4.25% for the first quarter of 2024. \n\nAverage CD balances increased $148.9 million, or 9.1%, compared to the linked quarter, driven by strong consumer demand, while the cost of funds increased 8 bps. The increase in the total cost of CDs was the lowest in the past two years, reflecting the narrowing gap between rates on new production/renewals and maturities. Assuming pricing remains in line with the second quarter, rates on new CD production are 6 – 8 bps lower than the rates on CDs maturing in the second half of 2024. \n\nThe average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits increased $59.0 million, or 14.2%, due to growth in fintech partnership deposits, while the cost of funds increased 15 bps. The average balance of money market accounts increased $25.0 million, or 2.1%, while the cost of funds increased 5 bps due to growth in larger-balance accounts. The average balance of BaaS – brokered deposits increased $34.3 million, or 40.2%, due to higher payments volumes, while the cost of funds decreased 2 bps. \n\nThese increases were partially offset by lower average brokered deposit balances, which decreased $81.7 million, or 13.5%, as excess liquidity was used to pay down $139.0 million of higher-cost brokered deposits. \n\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) was 1.67% for the second quarter of 2024, up from 1.66% for the first quarter of 2024 and up from 1.53% for the second quarter of 2023. Fully-taxable equivalent NIM (“FTE NIM”) was 1.76% for the second quarter of 2024, up from 1.75% for the first quarter of 2024 and up from 1.64% for the second quarter of 2023. The pace of increase in NIM and FTE NIM was down compared to the last two quarters due primarily to lower growth in average loan balances as the Company experienced both early payoffs and later-than-anticipated funding of larger-balance loans. \n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $11.0 million, compared to $8.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $5.9 million for the second quarter of 2023. Gain on sale of loans totaled $8.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, increasing $1.8 million, or 26.9%, compared to the linked quarter. Gain on sale revenue consisted almost entirely of sales of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) 7(a) guaranteed loans during the second quarter of 2024. Loan sale volume was up 18.9% and net premiums increased 6 bps compared to the linked quarter. Other income increased $1.2 million during the quarter due primarily to distributions from fund investments. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $0.2 million in net loan servicing revenue driven by the fair value adjustment to the loan servicing asset. \n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense totaled $22.3 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $21.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $18.7 million for the second quarter of 2023, representing increases of 6.2% and 19.6%, respectively. Excluding non-recurring costs of almost $0.6 million related to IT termination fees and anniversary expenses, adjusted noninterest expense totaled $21.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.7 million, or 3.5%, compared to the linked quarter. The increase was due mainly to higher salaries and employee benefits, consulting and professional fees and loan expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses. \n\nThe increase in recurring salaries and employee benefits was $0.5 million and was due primarily to higher small business incentive compensation and staff additions in small business lending and risk management. Consulting and professional fees increased $0.2 million due to the timing of outsourced audit services. Loan expenses increased $0.2 million due mainly to collection costs and third-party servicer fees. The decrease in marketing expenses of $0.1 million was due to lower advertising and media spend. \n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.2 million and an effective tax rate of 3.6% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to income tax expense of $0.4 million and an effective tax rate of 7.6% for the first quarter of 2024, and an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Loans and Credit Quality**\n\nTotal loans as of June 30, 2024 were $4.0 billion, an increase of $51.3 million, or 1.3%, compared to March 31, 2024, and an increase of $314.3 million, or 8.6%, compared to June 30, 2023. Total commercial loan balances were $3.1 billion as of June 30, 2024, an increase of $46.9 million, or 1.5%, compared to March 31, 2024, and an increase of $297.0 million, or 10.5%, compared to June 30, 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, the increase in commercial loan balances was driven primarily by growth in investor commercial real estate, small business lending and franchise finance balances. These items were partially offset by decreases in the commercial and industrial, single tenant lease financing, public finance and healthcare finance portfolios. Quarter-end balances in the commercial and industrial and construction portfolios were impacted by early payoffs of higher-yielding variable rate loans. The increase in investor commercial real estate balances included loans with strong variable rate pricing that closed later in the quarter and, therefore, had very little impact on interest income for the quarter. \n\nTotal consumer loan balances were $800.5 million as of June 30, 2024, an increase of $7.0 million, or 0.9%, compared to March 31, 2024, and an increase of $27.8 million, or 3.6%, compared to June 30, 2023. The increase compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to higher balances in the trailers, recreational vehicles and other consumer loan portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio. \n\nTotal delinquencies 30 days or more past due were 0.56% of total loans as of June 30, 2024, compared to 0.53% at March 31, 2024, and 0.09% as of June 30, 2023. The slight increase compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to an increase in delinquencies in residential mortgage loans. \n\nNonperforming loans were 0.33% of total loans as of June 30, 2024, unchanged from March 31, 2024, and compared to 0.17% as of June 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans totaled $13.0 million at June 30, 2024, down slightly from $13.1 million at March 31, 2024, and up from $6.2 million as of June 30, 2023. Additionally, the composition of nonperforming loans at the end of the second quarter of 2024 was relatively consistent with the linked quarter. \n\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of total loans was 1.10% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 1.05% as of March 31, 2024, and 0.99% as of June 30, 2023. The increase in the ACL reflects growth and higher coverage ratios in certain loan portfolios as well as additional reserves related to small business lending, partially offset by the positive impact of economic data on forecasted loss rates and qualitative factors on other portfolios. \n\nNet charge-offs of $1.4 million were recognized during the second quarter of 2024, resulting in net charge-offs to average loans of 0.14%, compared to $0.5 million, or 0.05%, for the first quarter of 2024, and $1.6 million, or 0.17%, for the second quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2024 were driven primarily by franchise finance, including one loan that had been previously reserved for, and small business lending. \n\nThe provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2024 was $4.0 million, compared to $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, and $1.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. The provision for the second quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by growth and changes in the loan composition, net charge-offs and an increase in reserves related to small business lending, partially offset by the positive impact of economic forecasts and adjustments to qualitative factors on other portfolios. \n\n**Capital**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, total shareholders’ equity was $372.0 million, an increase of $5.2 million, or 1.4%, compared to March 31, 2024, and an increase of $17.6 million, or 5.0%, compared to June 30, 2023. The increase in total shareholders’ equity during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to the net income earned during the quarter. Book value per common share increased to $42.91 as of June 30, 2024, up from $42.37 as of March 31, 2024, and $40.38 as of June 30, 2023. Tangible book value per share was $42.37 as of June 30, 2024, up from $41.83 as of March 31, 2024, and $39.85 as of June 30, 2023. \n\nThe following table presents the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory and other capital ratios as of June 30, 2024. \n\nAs of June 30, 2024   \n---  \nCompany  |  Bank   \nTotal shareholders' equity to assets  |  6.96%  |  8.45%   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets 1 |  6.88%  |  8.37%   \nTier 1 leverage ratio 2 |  7.24%  |  8.77%   \nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 2 |  9.47%  |  11.47%   \nTier 1 capital ratio 2 |  9.47%  |  11.47%   \nTotal risk-based capital ratio 2 |  13.13%  |  12.58%   \n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Forward-looking statements are generally identifiable by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “growth,” ”improve,” “may,” “ongoing,” “opportunities,” “pending,” “plan,” “position,” “preliminary,” “remain,” “should,” “thereafter,” “well-positioned,” “will,” or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information in the forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including: our business and operations and the business and operations of our vendors and customers: general economic conditions, whether national or regional, and conditions in the lending markets in which we participate that may have an adverse effect on the demand for our loans and other products; our credit quality and related levels of nonperforming assets and loan losses, and the value and salability of the real estate that is the collateral for our loans. Other factors that may cause such differences include: failures or breaches of or interruptions in the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business; failure of our plans to grow our commercial and industrial, construction, and SBA loan portfolios; competition with national, regional and community financial institutions; the loss of any key members of senior management; the anticipated impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on the general economy; risks relating to the regulation of financial institutions; and other factors identified in reports we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. All statements in this press release, including forward-looking statements, speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any statement in light of new information or future events. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Non-GAAP financial measures, specifically tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity to tangible assets, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, total interest income – FTE, net interest income – FTE, net interest margin – FTE, adjusted total revenue, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted noninterest expense, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income tax provision (benefit), adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average shareholders’ equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are used by the Company’s management to measure the strength of its capital and analyze profitability, including its ability to generate earnings on tangible capital invested by its shareholders. Although management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors by providing a greater understanding of its business, they should not be considered a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the table at the end of this release under the caption “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n**First Internet Bancorp**  \n---  \n**Summary Financial Information (unaudited)**  \n_Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data_  \n**Three Months Ended** |  **Six Months Ended**  \n**June 30,** |  **March 31,** |  **June 30,** |  **June 30,** |  **June 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net income** |  $  |  5,775  |  $  |  5,181  |  $  |  3,882  |  $  |  10,956  |  $  |  865   \n**Per share and share information**  \nEarnings per share -

          "content": "First Internet Bancorp Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nFishers, Indiana, October 23, 2024 – First Internet Bancorp (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: INBK), the\nparent company of First Internet Bank (the “Bank”), announced today financial and operational results\nfor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\n\nNet income of $7.0 million, an increase of 21.0% from the second quarter of 2024\n\nDiluted earnings per share of $0.80, an increase of 19.4% from the second quarter of\n2024\n Net interest income of $21.8 million and fully-taxable equivalent net interest income1\nof $22.9 million, increases of 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, from the second quarter of\n2024\n Net interest margin of 1.62% and fully-taxable equivalent net interest margin1 of\n1.70%, compared to 1.67% and 1.76%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2024\n\nNoninterest income of $12.0 million, a 9.0% increase from the second quarter of 2024\n\nLoan growth of $74.7 million, a 1.9% increase from the second quarter of 2024;\nDeposit growth of $523.8 million, a 12.3% increase from the second quarter of 2024;\nLoans to deposits ratio of 84.1%\n\nNonperforming loans to total loans of 0.56%; net charge-offs to average loans of\n0.15%; allowance for credit losses to total loans of 1.13%\n Tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio1 of 6.54%, and 7.49% ex-AOCI and\nadjusted for normalized cash balances1; CET1 ratio of 9.37%\n Tangible book value per share1 of $43.89, a 3.6% increase from the second quarter of\n2024, and a 10.9% increase from the third quarter of 2023\n“Our third quarter results demonstrated strong performance virtually across the board,” said David\nBecker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Growth in net interest income, driven by higher earning\nasset yields and stable funding costs, along with record gain-on-sale revenue from the continued\nexpansion of our national SBA platform, propelled an increase in operating revenues for the fifth\nconsecutive quarter, resulting in significant positive operating leverage.\n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, see the\nsection below entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n“Additionally, robust deposit growth and the ongoing strategic shift in loan mix have increased balance\nsheet flexibility, enhanced our interest rate risk profile, and improved our liquidity position to its\nstrongest level in recent history, as indicated by our loans-to-deposits ratio.\n“Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to deliver increased earnings and profitability by continuing to\nexecute our core strategies of revenue diversification and balance sheet optimization. Our balance\nsheet and capital position are solid, and measures of asset quality remain sound. I want to thank our\nemployees for their dedication and hard work in driving increased value for our stakeholders.”\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $21.8 million, compared to $21.3 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and $17.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. On a fully-taxable equivalent\nbasis, net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $22.9 million, compared to $22.5 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024, and $18.6 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nTotal interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $75.0 million, an increase of 5.7% compared to\nthe second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 19.0% compared to the third quarter of 2023. On a fully-\ntaxable equivalent basis, total interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $76.1 million, an\nincrease of 5.5% compared to the second quarter of 2024, and an increase of 18.4% compared to the\nthird quarter of 2023. The yield on average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024\nincreased to 5.58% from 5.54% for the second quarter of 2024, due to a 7 basis point (“bp”) increase in\nthe yield earned on loans, partially offset by a 7 bp decrease in the yield earned on other earning\nassets and a 1 bp decrease in the yield earned on securities. Compared to the linked quarter, average\nloan balances, including loans held-for-sale, increased $92.6 million, or 2.4%, while the average\nbalance of securities increased $47.9 million, or 6.4%, and the average balance of other earning assets\nincreased $57.3 million, or 12.2%.\nInterest income earned on commercial loans was higher due primarily to increased average balances\nwithin the investor commercial real estate, construction and small business lending portfolios. This was\npartially offset by lower average balances in the commercial and industrial and public finance portfolios,\nboth of which were impacted by early payoffs which resulted in lower interest income compared to the\nprior quarter. The continued shift in the loan mix reflects the Company’s focus on higher-yielding\nvariable rate products, in part, to help improve the interest rate risk profile of the balance sheet.\nIn the consumer loan portfolio, interest income was up due to the combination of higher average\nbalances and continued strong new origination yields in the trailers, RV and other consumer loan\nportfolios.\nThe yield on funded portfolio loan originations was 8.85% in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3\nbps compared to the second quarter of 2024, and a decrease of 7 bps compared to the third quarter of\n2023.\nInterest income earned on securities during the third quarter of 2024 increased $0.5 million, or 7.4%,\ncompared to the second quarter of 2024, driven primarily by new purchases and relatively stable yields\non the portfolio. Interest income earned on other earning asset balances increased $0.8 million, or\n-2-\n12.2%, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the linked quarter, due primarily to higher average cash\nbalances.\nTotal interest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $53.2 million, an increase of $3.6 million, or\n7.2%, compared to the linked quarter as short-term rates remained stable throughout most of the\nquarter while average interest-bearing deposits balances increased $211.1 million, or 5.1%. Interest\nexpense related to interest-bearing deposits increased $2.9 million, or 6.6%, driven primarily by higher\nbalances of certificates of deposits (“CDs”), interest-bearing demand deposits, fintech – brokered\ndeposits and brokered deposits. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was relatively stable during the\nquarter at 4.30%, compared to 4.29% for the second quarter of 2024.\nAverage CD balances increased $137.7 million, or 7.7%, compared to the linked quarter, driven by\nstrong consumer demand, while the cost of funds decreased 3 bps. CD pricing reached its inflection\npoint during the third quarter of 2024 as the weighted average cost of new CDs was 4.77%, or 28 bps\nlower than the cost of maturing CDs. As interest rates across the yield curve began falling ahead of the\nexpected cut in the Fed Funds rate in September, the Company lowered CD rates significantly during\nthe second half of the quarter. As a result, the weighted average cost of CD production during the\nmonth of September was 4.48%, or almost 30 bps lower than the average cost of new CDs for the\nquarter, and is 53 bps lower than the rates on CDs maturing in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing demand deposits increased $37.3 million, or 7.9%, due to\ngrowth in fintech partnership deposits, and the cost of funds increased 6 bps. The average balance of\nfintech – brokered deposits increased $33.3 million, or 27.9%, due to higher payments volumes, while\nthe cost of funds remained flat. The average balance of brokered deposits increased $21.3 million, or\n4.1%, compared to the linked quarter, and the cost of funds increased 19 bps.\nInterest expense was also impacted by the cost of other borrowed funds. The average balance of FHLB\nadvances declined during the third quarter of 2024; however, the cost of funds increased as lower-cost\nadvances matured. Additionally, one of the Company’s subordinated debt issuances converted from\nfixed to floating rate early in the third quarter of 2024. As a result, the cost of other borrowed funds\nincreased 56 bps.\nNet interest margin (“NIM”) was 1.62% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.67% for the second\nquarter of 2024 and up from 1.39% for the third quarter of 2023. Fully-taxable equivalent NIM (“FTE\nNIM”) was 1.70% for the third quarter of 2024, down from 1.76% for the second quarter of 2024 and up\nfrom 1.49% for the third quarter of 2023. NIM and FTE NIM performance for the third quarter was\naffected by carrying higher cash balances, which are estimated to have had a negative impact of 6 bps.\nFurthermore, the early loan payoff activity discussed above also had a negative impact of 6 bps.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $12.0 million, compared to $11.0 million for the\nsecond quarter of 2024, and $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. Gain on sale of loans totaled $9.9\nmillion in the third quarter of 2024, increasing $1.6 million, or 19.8%, compared to the linked quarter.\nGain on sale revenue consisted almost entirely of sales of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”)\n7(a) guaranteed loans during the third quarter of 2024. Loan sale volume was up 22.1% while net\n-3-\npremiums decreased 65 bps compared to the linked quarter. Other income decreased $0.7 million\nduring the quarter due primarily to lower distributions from fund investments. Net loan servicing revenue\nincreased by $0.1 million due to the growth in the servicing portfolio, partially offset by the fair value\nadjustment to the loan servicing asset.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $22.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.3 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024, and $19.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, representing increases of\n2.1% and 15.4%, respectively. Excluding non-recurring costs of almost $0.6 million recognized in the\nsecond quarter of 2024, noninterest expense increased $1.0 million, or 4.7%, in the third quarter of\n2024 from the linked quarter. The increase was driven mainly by higher salaries and employee benefits\ndue to higher small business lending incentive compensation as well as staff additions in small\nbusiness lending and risk management.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $0.6 million and an effective tax rate of 8.1% for the\nthird quarter of 2024, compared to income tax expense of $0.2 million and an effective tax rate of 3.6%\nfor the second quarter of 2024, and an income tax benefit of $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nLoans and Credit Quality\nTotal loans as of September 30, 2024, were $4.0 billion, an increase of $74.7 million, or 1.9%,\ncompared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $300.8 million, or 8.1%, compared to September 30,\n2023. Total commercial loan balances were $3.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $75.5\nmillion, or 2.4%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $295.2 million, or 10.2%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. Compared to the linked quarter, the increase in commercial loan balances was\ndriven primarily by growth in investor commercial real estate, small business lending and construction\nbalances. These items were partially offset by decreases in the public finance, healthcare finance and\ncommercial and industrial portfolios. Quarter-end balances in the commercial and industrial and public\nfinance portfolios were impacted by early payoffs. The increase in investor commercial real estate\nbalances included loans with strong variable rate pricing that converted from construction loans upon\nproject completion.\nTotal consumer loan balances were $803.4 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.9\nmillion, or 0.4%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $16.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase compared to the linked quarter was due primarily to a higher\nbalance in the trailers portfolio, partially offset by declines in the residential mortgage and home equity\nportfolios.\nTotal delinquencies 30 days or more past due were 0.75% of total loans as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 0.56% at June 30, 2024, and 0.22% as of September 30, 2023. The increase compared to\nthe linked quarter was due primarily to an increase in delinquencies in franchise finance and small\nbusiness lending loans. Nonperforming loans were 0.56% of total loans as of September 30, 2024, up\nfrom 0.33% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.16% as of September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans totaled\n$22.5 million as of September 30, 2024, up from $13.0 million as of June 30, 2024, and up from $5.9\nmillion as of September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans at the end of the third quarter of\n-4-\n2024 was due primarily to franchise finance and small business lending loans that were placed on\nnonaccrual during the quarter. At quarter end, there were $10.1 million of specific reserves held against\nthe balance of nonperforming loans.\nThe allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) as a percentage of total loans was 1.13% as of September 30,\n2024, compared to 1.10% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.98% as of September 30, 2023. The increase in\nthe ACL reflects growth and higher coverage ratios in certain loan portfolios, as well as additional\nreserves related to small business lending and franchise finance, partially offset by the positive impact\nof economic data on forecasted loss rates and qualitative factors on other portfolios.\nNet charge-offs of $1.5 million were recognized during the third quarter of 2024, resulting in net charge-\noffs to average loans of 0.15%, compared to $1.4 million, or 0.14%, for the second quarter of 2024, and\n$1.5 million, or 0.16%, for the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were\ndriven primarily by small business lending.\nThe provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.4 million, compared to $4.0 million for\nthe second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The provision for the third\nquarter of 2024 was driven primarily by growth and changes in the loan composition, net charge-offs\nand an increase in reserves related to franchise finance and small business lending, partially offset by\nthe positive impact of economic forecasts and adjustments to qualitative factors on other portfolios.\nCapital\nAs of September 30, 2024, total shareholders’ equity was $385.1 million, an increase of $13.2 million,\nor 3.5%, compared to June 30, 2024, and an increase of $37.4 million, or 10.8%, compared to\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in total shareholders’ equity during the third quarter compared to the\nlinked quarter was due primarily to the net income earned during the quarter and a decrease in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Book value per common share increased to $44.43 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, up from $42.91 as of June 30, 2024, and $40.11 as of September 30, 2023.\nTangible book value per share was $43.89 as of September 30, 2024, up from $42.37 as of June 30,\n2024, and $39.57 as of September 30, 2023.\nThe following table presents the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory and other capital ratios as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024\nCompany Bank\nTotal shareholders' equity to assets 6.61% 7.95%\nTangible common equity to tangible assets 1 6.54% 7.87%\nTier 1 leverage ratio 2 7.13% 8.53%\nCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio 2 9.37% 11.22%\nTier 1 capital ratio 2 9.37% 11.22%\nTotal risk-based capital ratio 2 12.79% 12.34%\n1 This information represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, are\nbased on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the information in the\nforward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including: our business\nand operations and the business and operations of our vendors and customers: general economic conditions,\nwhether national or regional, and conditions in the lending markets in which we participate that may have an\nadverse effect on the demand for our loans and other products; our credit quality and related levels of\nnonperforming assets and loan losses, and the value and salability of the real estate that is the collateral for our\nloans.

Non-GAAP financial measures, specifically tangible common\nequity, tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity to tangible assets,\naverage tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, total interest income – FTE, net\ninterest income – FTE, net interest margin – FTE, adjusted total revenue, adjusted noninterest income, adjusted\nnoninterest expense, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income tax provision (benefit), adjusted net\nincome, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average\nshareholders’ equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity are used by the Company’s\nmanagement to measure the strength of its capital and analyze profitability, including its ability to generate\n-6-\nearnings on tangible capital invested by its shareholders. Although management believes these non-GAAP\nmeasures are useful to investors by providing a greater understanding of its business, they should not be\nconsidered a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily\ncomparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in\nthe table at the end of this release under the caption “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nContact information:\nInvestors/Analysts Media\nPaula Deemer PANBlast\nDirector of Corporate Administration Zach Weismiller\n(317) 428-4628 firstib@panblastpr.com\ninvestors@firstib.com\n-7-\nFirst Internet Bancorp\nSummary Financial Information (unaudited)\nDollar amounts in thousands, except per share data\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 6,990 $ 5,775 $ 3,409 $ 17,946 $ 4,274\nPer share and share information\nEarnings per share -
