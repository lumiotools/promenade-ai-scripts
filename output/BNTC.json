(NASDAQ: BNTC) (“Benitec” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage, gene therapy-focused, biotechnology company developing novel genetic medicines based on its proprietary “Silence and Replace” DNA-directed RNA interference (“ddRNAi”) platform, today announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company has filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n“We recently announced the 270-day interim clinical study results for the first Subject and the 180-day interim clinical study results for the second Subject enrolled into the low-dose cohort of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Treatment Study. We continue to be extremely grateful for the strong support of the Subjects and their families and for their continued participation in the BB-301 clinical development program. We were highly encouraged by the significant, clinically meaningful improvements observed for both Subjects treated at the low-dose of BB-301, with Subject 1 experiencing durable improvements in core dysphagic symptoms of 35% to 40%, and Subject 2 achieving a clinically normal swallowing profile based on the results of the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire,” said Jerel A. Banks, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Benitec. “The third Subject was treated with the low-dose of BB-301 in October 2024, and we anticipate the treatment of the fourth Subject in December 2024. We remain optimistic about the potential for continued benefit in Subjects enrolled in the ongoing study and, including funds from recent exercises of shareholder-held warrants, Benitec is well-funded to advance the BB-301 clinical development program. We look forward to enrolling additional Subjects at the next, higher dose of BB-301, in 2025.”\n\n**Operational Updates**\n\nThe key milestones related to the development of BB-301 for the treatment of Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD)-related Dysphagia, are outlined below:\n\n**Summary of Interim Clinical Study Results for Subject 1 and Subject 2:**\n\n  * At the lowest-dose of gene therapy BB-301 (1.2e13 vg/subject), there were no Significant Adverse Events observed.\n  * Dysphagic symptoms at baseline for Subject 1 (7-years post diagnosis) were more severe than those of Subject 2 (6-years post diagnosis) as assessed by pre-dose Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) and Total Pharyngeal Residue (TPR) results, but both subjects experienced significant clinical benefit per the post-dose SSQ scores and TPR results.\n  * The SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores correlate strongly with the Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) TPR results.\n  * Subject 1 experienced clinically meaningful improvements in post-dose SSQ Total Score and SSQ Sub-Scores at Day 270 driven by corresponding reductions in VFSS TPR values.\n  * Subject 2 experienced clinically meaningful improvements in post-dose SSQ Total Score and SSQ Sub-Scores at Day 180, with an SSQ Total Score representative of a normal swallowing profile, driven by a corresponding reduction in the frequency of pathologic low-volume sequential swallows.\n  * These data represent the first reported successful improvements in swallowing function following the use of a novel gene therapy for OPMD.\n\n\n\n**Subjects Enrolled in the BB-301 Clinical Development Program are Impacted by Two Discrete Drivers of Dysphagic Symptoms:**\n\n  * Excessive accumulation of pharyngeal residue post-swallow (i.e., inefficiency of swallowing) represents one key driver of dysphagic symptoms. \n  * Pathologic low-volume sequential swallows represent a second key driver of dysphagic symptoms. \n    * Pathologic low-volume sequential swallows are characterized on videofluoroscopic swallowing study examination as rapid contractions of the pharyngeal muscles without full restoration of the resting pharyngeal diameter between contractions.\n    * This pharyngeal contraction pattern is aberrant and is not observed in healthy subjects during the consumption of low-volumes of thin liquids (e.g., 15 milliliters water).\n\n\n\n**Interim Clinical Study Results for Subject 1 (270-Days Post Treatment with BB-301):**\n\n  * Global inefficiency of swallowing for solid food, thin liquid, and thick liquids drives dysphagia for Subject 1.\n  * Subject 1 displayed continued clinically meaningful reductions (i.e., improvements) in SSQ Total Score (35% reduction) and SSQ Sub-Scores (42% reduction for Thin Liquid, 16% reduction for Solid Food, and 22% reduction for Thick Liquids). Subject 1 displayed correspondingly significant reductions (i.e., improvements) in VFSS TPR (33% reduction for Thin Liquid, 18% reduction for Solid Food, and 30% reduction for Thick Liquids) following the administration of the low-dose of BB-301 as compared to the average values recorded for Subject 1 during the pre-dose period.\n\n\n\n**Interim Clinical Study Results for Subject 2 (180-Days Post Treatment with BB-301):**\n\n  * Pathologic low-volume sequential swallowing for thin liquid drives dysphagia for Subject 2. Pathologic low-volume sequential swallows are experienced by the Subject as multiple swallows and are detected during VFSS as a continuous series of rapid contractions of the pharyngeal muscles without full restoration of the resting pharyngeal diameter between contractions. The pathologic pattern of contractions interrupts the discrete peristaltic contractions typically observed during swallows of low volumes of thin liquids (e.g., 15 milliliters water), during which the resting diameter of the pharynx is fully restored between successive swallows.\n  * Subject 2 displayed clinically meaningful reductions (i.e., improvements) in SSQ Total Score (89% reduction) and the SSQ Sub-Score for the necessity of repeat swallows during consumption (84% reduction) as compared to the average values recorded for Subject 2 during the pre-dose period. The average post-dose SSQ Total Score of 82 is representative of a clinically normal swallowing profile for Subject 2. Subject 2 displayed correspondingly significant reductions (i.e., improvements) in the post-dose frequency of pathologic low-volume sequential swallows as evaluated by VFSS (92% reduction) following the administration of the low-dose of BB-301 as compared to the pre-dose values recorded for Subject 2.\n\n\n\nBoth Subjects were blinded to their SSQ Total Scores and VFSS TPR assessment results, and the Central Reader for the VFSS assessments was blinded to the SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores for each Subject.\n\n**Enrollment into the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Treatment Study is Ongoing:**\n\n  * The third Subject was safely treated with the low-dose of BB-301 in October 2024, and the fourth Subject is anticipated to receive the low-dose of BB-301 in December 2024.\n\n\n\n**Adverse Events:**\n\n  * No Serious Adverse Events have been observed for the three Subjects treated with the low-dose of BB-301.\n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * On October 12th the Principal Investigator of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Treatment Study shared updated interim results for two Subjects treated in the Phase 1b/2a Open-label, Dose Escalation Study of BB-301 in a late-breaking oral presentation at the 29th Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society, in Prague, Czech Republic.\n  * The Company held a webcast discussing the interim clinical study results on October 14th (the replay of this event is available [here](https://www.benitec.com/for-investors/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/20241014-interim-bb-301-phase-1b-clinical-study-update \"Opens in a new window\")).\n\n\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n_First Quarter 2025 Financial Results_\n\nTotal Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $0 million compared to $0 revenues collected for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nTotal Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $5.8 million compared to $5.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

The two siRNAs are modeled into microRNA backbones to silence expression of faulty mutant PABPN1, while allowing expression of the codon-optimized PABPN1 to replace the mutant with a functional version of the protein. We believe the silence and replace mechanism of BB-301 is uniquely positioned for the treatment of OPMD by halting mutant expression while providing a functional replacement protein.\n\n**About Benitec Biopharma, Inc.**\n\nBenitec Biopharma Inc.

The disease is characterized by swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), limb weakness and eyelid drooping (ptosis). Dysphagia worsens over time and can lead to chronic choking, regurgitation, aspiration pneumonia, and in severe cases, death. Available clinical and surgical interventions are limited in scope and effectiveness and do not address the underlying progressive muscle weakness.\n\n**About BB-301** BB-301 is a novel, modified AAV9 capsid expressing a unique, single bifunctional construct promoting co-expression of both codon-optimized Poly-A Binding Protein Nuclear-1 (PABPN1) and two small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) against mutant PABPN1. The two siRNAs are modeled into microRNA backbones to silence expression of faulty mutant PABPN1, while allowing expression of the codon-optimized PABPN1 to replace the mutant with a functional version of the protein. We believe the silence and replace mechanism of BB-301 is uniquely positioned for the treatment of OPMD by halting mutant expression while providing a functional replacement protein.\n\n**About Benitec Biopharma, Inc.** Benitec Biopharma Inc.

The\nCompany has filed its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n“We recently announced the 270-day interim clinical study results for the first Subject and\nthe 180-day interim clinical study results for the second Subject enrolled into the low-dose\ncohort of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Treatment Study. We continue to be extremely\ngrateful for the strong support of the Subjects and their families and for their continued\nparticipation in the BB-301 clinical development program. We were highly encouraged by the\nsignificant, clinically meaningful improvements observed for both Subjects treated at the low-\ndose of BB-301, with Subject 1 experiencing durable improvements in core dysphagic\nsymptoms of 35% to 40%, and Subject 2 achieving a clinically normal swallowing profile\nbased on the results of the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire,” said Jerel A. Banks, M.D.,\nPh.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Benitec. “The third Subject was\ntreated with the low-dose of BB-301 in October 2024, and we anticipate the treatment of the\nfourth Subject in December 2024. We remain optimistic about the potential for continued\nbenefit in Subjects enrolled in the ongoing study and, including funds from recent exercises\nof shareholder-held warrants, Benitec is well-funded to advance the BB-301 clinical\ndevelopment program. We look forward to enrolling additional Subjects at the next, higher\ndose of BB-301, in 2025.”\nOperational Updates\nThe key milestones related to the development of BB-301 for the treatment of\nOculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD)-related Dysphagia, are outlined below:\nSummary of Interim Clinical Study Results for Subject 1 and Subject 2:\nAt the lowest-dose of gene therapy BB-301 (1.2e13 vg/subject), there were no\nSignificant Adverse Events observed.\nDysphagic symptoms at baseline for Subject 1 (7-years post diagnosis) were more\nsevere than those of Subject 2 (6-years post diagnosis) as assessed by pre-dose\nSydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) and Total Pharyngeal Residue (TPR) results,\nbut both subjects experienced significant clinical benefit per the post-dose SSQ scores\nand TPR results.\nThe SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores correlate strongly with the\nVideofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) TPR results.\nSubject 1 experienced clinically meaningful improvements in post-dose SSQ Total\nScore and SSQ Sub-Scores at Day 270 driven by corresponding reductions in VFSS\nTPR values.\nSubject 2 experienced clinically meaningful improvements in post-dose SSQ Total\nScore and SSQ Sub-Scores at Day 180, with an SSQ Total Score representative of a\nnormal swallowing profile, driven by a corresponding reduction in the frequency of\npathologic low-volume sequential swallows.\nThese data represent the first reported successful improvements in swallowing function\nfollowing the use of a novel gene therapy for OPMD.\nSubjects Enrolled in the BB-301 Clinical Development Program are Impacted by Two\nDiscrete Drivers of Dysphagic Symptoms:\nExcessive accumulation of pharyngeal residue post-swallow (i.e., inefficiency of\nswallowing) represents one key driver of dysphagic symptoms.\nPathologic low-volume sequential swallows represent a second key driver of dysphagic\nsymptoms.\nPathologic low-volume sequential swallows are characterized on\nvideofluoroscopic swallowing study examination as rapid contractions of the\npharyngeal muscles without full restoration of the resting pharyngeal diameter\nbetween contractions.\nThis pharyngeal contraction pattern is aberrant and is not observed in healthy\nsubjects during the consumption of low-volumes of thin liquids (e.g., 15 milliliters\nwater).\nInterim Clinical Study Results for Subject 1 (270-Days Post Treatment with BB-301):\nGlobal inefficiency of swallowing for solid food, thin liquid, and thick liquids drives\ndysphagia for Subject 1.\nSubject 1 displayed continued clinically meaningful reductions (i.e., improvements) in\nSSQ Total Score (35% reduction) and SSQ Sub-Scores (42% reduction for Thin\nLiquid, 16% reduction for Solid Food, and 22% reduction for Thick Liquids). Subject 1\ndisplayed correspondingly significant reductions (i.e., improvements) in VFSS TPR\n(33% reduction for Thin Liquid, 18% reduction for Solid Food, and 30% reduction for\nThick Liquids) following the administration of the low-dose of BB-301 as compared to\nthe average values recorded for Subject 1 during the pre-dose period.\nInterim Clinical Study Results for Subject 2 (180-Days Post Treatment with BB-301):\nPathologic low-volume sequential swallowing for thin liquid drives dysphagia for\nSubject 2. Pathologic low-volume sequential swallows are experienced by the Subject\nas multiple swallows and are detected during VFSS as a continuous series of rapid\ncontractions of the pharyngeal muscles without full restoration of the resting\npharyngeal diameter between contractions. The pathologic pattern of contractions\ninterrupts the discrete peristaltic contractions typically observed during swallows of low\nvolumes of thin liquids (e.g., 15 milliliters water), during which the resting diameter of\nthe pharynx is fully restored between successive swallows.\nSubject 2 displayed clinically meaningful reductions (i.e., improvements) in SSQ Total\nScore (89% reduction) and the SSQ Sub-Score for the necessity of repeat swallows\nduring consumption (84% reduction) as compared to the average values recorded for\nSubject 2 during the pre-dose period. The average post-dose SSQ Total Score of 82 is\nrepresentative of a clinically normal swallowing profile for Subject 2. Subject 2\ndisplayed correspondingly significant reductions (i.e., improvements) in the post-dose\nfrequency of pathologic low-volume sequential swallows as evaluated by VFSS (92%\nreduction) following the administration of the low-dose of BB-301 as compared to the\npre-dose values recorded for Subject 2.\nBoth Subjects were blinded to their SSQ Total Scores and VFSS TPR assessment results,\nand the Central Reader for the VFSS assessments was blinded to the SSQ Total Scores\nand SSQ Sub-Scores for each Subject.\nEnrollment into the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical Treatment Study is Ongoing:\nThe third Subject was safely treated with the low-dose of BB-301 in October 2024, and\nthe fourth Subject is anticipated to receive the low-dose of BB-301 in December 2024.\nAdverse Events:\nNo Serious Adverse Events have been observed for the three Subjects treated with the\nlow-dose of BB-301.\nCorporate Updates:\nOn October 12th the Principal Investigator of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical\nTreatment Study shared updated interim results for two Subjects treated in the Phase\n1b/2a Open-label, Dose Escalation Study of BB-301 in a late-breaking oral\npresentation at the 29th Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society, in Prague,\nCzech Republic.\nThe Company held a webcast discussing the interim clinical study results on October\n14th (the replay of this event is available here).\nFinancial Highlights\nFirst Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nTotal Revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $0 million compared to $0\nrevenues collected for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nTotal Expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $5.8 million compared to\n$5.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

(1.2e13 vg/subject), and there were no Significant Adverse\nEvents.\n• Dysphagic symptoms at baseline for Subject 1 (7-years post diagnosis) were more severe than those of Subject 2 (6-\nyears post diagnosis) as assessed by pre-dose SSQ and TPR results, but both Subjects experienced significant levels of\nclinical benefit per the post-dose SSQ scores and TPR results.\n• The SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores correlate strongly with the VFSS TPR results.\n• Subject 1 experienced clinically meaningful improvement in post-dose Sydney Swallow Questionnaire Score at Day 270\ndriven by corresponding reductions in Total Pharyngeal Residue values.\n• Subject 2 experienced clinically meaningful improvement in post-dose Sydney Swallow Questionnaire Score at Day\n180, with a score representative of a normal swallowing profile, driven by a corresponding reduction in the frequency of\npathologic low-volume sequential swallows.\n• These data represent the first reported successful improvements in swallow function using a novel gene therapy for\nOPMD.\n5\nOculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy:\nClinical and Pathophysiological\nOverview\n6\nOPMD: A Chronic, Progressive Disease With No Approved Therapeutics\n• Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, chronic, myopathic disorder with a typical age of\nonset in the 40s-50s\n• OPMD results from a trinucleotide repeat expansion within exon 1 of the polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene\nWildtype: ATG (GCG) ------------- (GCA) GCG GGG GCT GCG…\n6 3\nOPMD Mutant: ATG (GCG) (GCN) (GCA) GCG GGG GCT GCG…\n6 1-7 3\n• OPMD has been diagnosed in at least 33 countries, and currently impacts an estimated 15,000 patients in North America\nEurope, and Israel\n• Large patient cohorts exist globally as verified by the literature and specific patient/population databases (e.g., the\nUniversity of New Mexico Patient Data-Base comprises several hundred subjects)\nEstimated OPMD Estimated OPMD\nCountry/Province/Region Population Prevalence Estimate Patient Population\nUnited States 333,000,000 0.00001 3,330\nQuebec 8,500,000 0.001 8,500\nEurope 742,000,000 0.00001 7,420\n7\nOPMD: Clinical Presentation\n• OPMD typically presents with:\n• Ptosis (eyelid drooping) which can be asymmetric at onset\n• Choking during meals (dysphagia), leading to prolonged mealtimes and\navoidance of specific food\n• A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Saguenay Neuromuscular\nClinic (Quebec, Canada) to screen for and characterize their OPMD population\n• Dysphagia was present in 96.6% of subjects\n• Pharyngeal pooling of thickened secretions was present in 74.1% of\nsubjects\n• Dysphagia worsens over time and, as a result, patients can develop\nmalnutrition and aspiration pneumonia which can lead to death\nBrisson, JD, Muscle & Nerve, 2020\n8\nCurrent Clinical Management Strategies for Dysphagia Do Not\nPrevent Disease Progression\n• Nutritional recommendations including dietary texture/consistency modifications\n• Surgical Interventions for moderate to severe dysphagia have temporary effects and may require repeated\nadministration/application:\n– Cricopharyngeal muscle paralysis with botulinum toxin injection\n– Cricopharyngeal muscle dilation\n– Cricopharyngeal myotomy\n• In all cases, the pharyngeal constrictor muscles continue to atrophy, leading to progressive loss of\npharyngeal propulsion/clearance of food and liquid into the esophagus\n9\nBB-301 Inhibits the Production of the key Disease-Causing Protein in\nOPMD and Delivers a New, Fully-Functional Version of the Protein\n•\nBB-301 is a gene therapy designed by Benitec Biopharma Inc. to accomplish two goals:\nDesign of Lead

BB-301 Injection Sites\n• In OPMD, the pharyngeal constrictor muscles are\nweakened and atrophic and unable to support the\npropulsion of food or liquid towards the esophagus\n• In the current clinical study, BB-301 is delivered to the\npharyngeal constrictor muscles via direct intramuscular\ninjection in the operating room\n• Potential BB-301-derived increases in muscle cross-\nBB-301\nsectional area, muscle mass, and muscle force should\ngenerate excess capacity in the pharyngeal constrictor\nmuscles of OPMD patients to enhance the functional\ncapacity of the muscles, thereby reducing dysphagia\n13\nPathophysiology of\nDysphagia in OPMD\n14\nDistinct Drivers of Dysphagia Noted in the OPMD Study Population\n• OPMD subjects enrolled into the OPMD Natural History Study and the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical\nStudy have been shown to be impacted by excessive accumulation of pharyngeal residue post-swallow\n• OPMD subjects enrolled into the OPMD Natural History Study and the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Clinical\nStudy have also been shown to be impacted by increased frequency of pathologic low-volume\nsequential swallows (i.e., rapid contractions of the pharyngeal muscles during the consumption of low\nvolumes of thin liquids)\n15\nImpaired Pharyngeal Clearance Leads\nto Aspiration, Aspiration Pneumonia,\nand Death\nApproximately one third of subjects had respiratory\ndiagnoses listed as the cause of death:\n• Impaired swallowing (dysphagia) can lead to aspiration\npneumonia\n• Pneumonia can result from the aspiration of food\nand/or liquid\n• Pneumonia can also result from the aspiration of\nthickened pharyngeal secretions\nBrisson, JD, Muscle & Nerve, 2020\n16\nSequential Swallowing is a Normal Physiologic Process Observed in Healthy Subjects During\nthe Consumption of Large Volumes of Thin Liquid (e.g., ³90 mL of Water)\n• Sequential swallowing is defined as the completion of two or more consecutive swallows in rapid succession where the hyolaryngeal\ncomplex (HLC) does not return to rest and the pharynx lacks complete patency between swallows1\n• Under normal physiologic conditions, sequential swallowing occurs during continuous drinking of large volumes (90 mL or greater) of\nthin liquids via straw, cup, or bottle (for reference, one can of a soft drink has a volume of approximately 355 mL of thin liquid)\n• 90 mL of Thin Liquid administered by cup1\n• 300 mL of Thin Liquid administered by straw in 10-second tasks2\n• 150 mL of Thin Liquid administered by cup and soda bottle3\n• Distinct from the pharyngeal swallowing patterns observed for large volumes of thin liquids (i.e., 90 mL or greater), low-volume thin\nliquids (approximately 15 mL or less) progress through the pharynx via discrete swallows characterized by coordinated, peristaltic,\nsequential contractions and relaxations of the pharyngeal muscles moving from the cranial to the caudal direction towards the UES\n• At the conclusion of each discrete swallow of low-volume thin liquid, the pharyngeal muscles relax completely, and following\nthe closure of the UES, the HLC returns to rest, and pharyngeal patency is restored prior to the initiation of the subsequent wave\nof peristaltic pharyngeal muscle contractions\n17 1Ambrocio, K. R., et al., Dysphagia (2023) 38:1497–1510; 2Daniels, S.K., Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, Vol. 47, 33–45, February 2004; 3Chi-Fishman, G. and Sonies, B., Journal of\nSpeech, Language, and Hearing Research, Vol. 43, 1481–1492, December 2000\nDuring VFSS Assessments, Pathologic Sequential Swallowing was Detected for OPMD Subjects\nDuring the Consumption of Low Volumes of Thin Liquids (i.e., <15 mL of Thin Liquid)\n• For the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Study, the achievement of physiologic pharyngeal muscle relaxation during the\nswallowing of low-volume thin liquid is verified on VFSS by the identification of the the “Swallow Rest Frame”\n• Swallow rest is the terminal event of each discrete swallow, identified as the first VFSS frame showing the\npyriform sinuses at their lowest position, relative to the spine, prior to any hyoid burst or laryngeal elevation for\na subsequent subswallow1\n• In diseases for which dysphagia is a core symptom (e.g., OPMD), during the consumption of low volumes of thin\nliquids (e.g., thin liquid swallowing tasks of less than 15 mL employed in the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Study),\nphysiologic pharyngeal muscle relaxation is not always achieved, and a subject instead experiences pathologic\nsequential swallows when consuming low volumes of thin liquids\n• Pathologic low-volume sequential swallows are experienced by the subject as multiple swallows and are\ndetected during VFSS as a series of rapid contractions of the pharyngeal muscles interrupting the discrete\nperistaltic contraction pattern typically observed during swallows of low-volume thin liquids\n18\n1Steele, C., et al., Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research, Vol. 62, 1338–1363, May 2019\nBB-301 Clinical\nDevelopment Program\n19\nBB-301 Clinical

Therefore, the study subject is best positioned to accurately assess changes in the level of\ndifficulty associated with swallowing activities (i.e., dysphagia) over the course of a 6-month or 12-month period\n• Reductions in Total Pharyngeal Residue (“TPR”) as assessed via VFSS post BB-301 dose (i.e., reductions in the total amount of solid\nfood or liquid material remaining in the pharynx at the completion of swallowing)\n• TPR is objectively characterized via VFSS which evaluate the complete swallowing process for each subject in the context of distinct\nfood and liquid types/consistencies (i.e., Thin Liquid, Thick Liquid, and Solid Food)\n• Regarding the liquid consistencies: Thin Liquid is similar to water, Thick Liquid is similar to a smoothie or yogurt\n25\nInterim Low-Dose BB-301 (1.2e13\nvg/subject) Phase 1b Clinical Data\nSummary for the First Two Study Subjects\nDemonstrates Strong Correlations\nBetween Videofluoroscopic Swallowing\nStudy Results and the Sydney Swallow\nQuestionnaire Scores\n26\nPre-Dose Characteristics of Subject 1 and Subject 2 Demonstrate Strong\nCorrelations Between SSQ Scores and VFSS TPR Results\n• Milder Dysphagic Symptoms Noted for Subject 2 vs. Subject 1 Based on SSQ Scores and VFSS TPR Results\n• Global inefficiency of swallowing for Solid Food, Thin Liquid, and Thick Liquids Drives Dysphagia for Subject 1\n• Pathologic low-volume sequential swallowing for thin liquid and inefficient swallowing of Solid Food Drives Dysphagia for Subject 2\n24\n18\n15.1\n14.1\n12\n5.3\n6 4.9\n2.6\n1.5\n0\nSubject 1 Thin Subject 2 Thin Subject 1 Thick Subject 2 Thick Subject 1 Solid Subject 2 Solid\nLiquid Liquid Liquid Liquid Food Food\nAll Study Subjects are blinded to their SSQ Total Scores and VFSS (TPR) assessment results, and the Central Reader for the VFSS\nAssessments is blinded to the SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores for all Study Subjects\n27\n)%(\neudiseR\nlaegnyrahP\nlatoT\nBaseline Avg.

normal swallowing profile.\nSummary and Conclusions\n• Two subjects have received the lowest-dose of BB-301 (1.2e13 vg/subject) with compelling clinical impact\n• There were no Significant Adverse Events\n• Both subjects experienced significant levels of clinical benefit per the post-dose SSQ scores\n• Both subjects experienced significant levels of benefit per the post-dose VFSS TPR results\n• The subject with pathologic low-volume sequential swallows at baseline experienced an almost complete\nresolution of this problem and achieved an SSQ score indicative of clinically normal swallowing\n• We believe these early data reflect a major impact on the subject’s swallowing function and activities of daily\nliving, and represent the first successful improvement in swallowing by a gene therapy in OPMD\n• Dysphagic symptoms at baseline for Subject 1 (7-years post diagnosis) were more severe than those of Subject 2 (6-\nyears post diagnosis) as assessed by pre-dose SSQ and TPR results\n• Despite baseline differences, the SSQ Total Scores and SSQ Sub-Scores correlate strongly with the VFSS TPR\nresults.\n• We expect to deepen our understanding of the therapy and the potential impact for patients as we continue the\ntreatment of subjects in the low dose cohort and, subsequently, advance to a higher dose\n• The preclinical proof-of-concept data for BB-301 demonstrated greater improvements in muscle strength at higher\ndoses, and we are optimistic about the potential for improved efficacy as we enter the next dosing cohort\n37\nSummary and Conclusions (continued)\n• The Total SSQ scores represent the most accurate reflection of the subjects’ experiences of their pre-dose and post-dose\ndysphagic symptoms.\n• The final pre-dose visit is temporally closest to the subjects’ post-dose experiences\n• The final pre-dose visit likely represents the most vividly memorable pre-drug dysphagic symptomology for each subject\nand serves as the ideal comparison for efficacy assessments\n• As a result, we compare the post-dose clinical results with both pre-dose averages and the final pre-dose visit\n• Improvements in dysphagic symptoms may relate directly to post-dose improvements in efficiencies of swallowing for the\ntypes/consistencies of food and liquid most commonly ingested by the subject or the correction of altered swallowing\nphysiology (e.g., reductions in the frequency of pathologic low-volume sequential swallows)\n• Daily diets consist primarily of thin liquids (e.g., water, juice, tea, coffee, etc.) and solid foods\n• The post-dose reductions in TPR for these types/consistencies of food and liquid should meaningfully reduce the subject’s\ndaily dysphagic symptoms and, therefore, Total SSQ scores and the corresponding SSQ Sub-Scores\n• We expect that improvement for the most adversely impacted consistencies will drive the most significant improvements\nregarding a subject’s SSQ Score and overall swallowing function\n38\nQ&A: Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Studies\nand Subject-Reported Outcome Measures\nProfessor Emily Plowman, PhD, CCC-SLP, FASHA\n39\nAppendix\n40\nOPMD: A Chronic, Progressive Disease With No Approved Therapeutics\n• Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, chronic, myopathic disorder characterized by\nptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) and progressive dysphagia (loss of the ability to swallow) due to impairment of the\nmuscles of the eyelids and throat.\n• Typical age of onset in the 40s-50s, and affects approximately 15k adults in the US, Canada, Europe and Israel.\n• Progressive dysphagia increases the risks of severe malnutrition and potentially life-threatening aspiration pneumonia.\n• In OPMD, a genetic mutation results in trinucleotide repeat expansion within exon 1 of PABPN1 producing an expanded poly-\nalanine tract of up to 18 contiguous alanine residues at the N-terminal end of the PABPN1 protein; the PABPN1 mutant\nprotein is aggregation prone and drives the formation of intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in the myocytes which can cause cell\ndeath and/or loss of function (see appendix for additional information):\nWildtype: ATG (GCG) ------------- (GCA) GCG GGG GCT GCG…\n6 3\nOPMD Mutant: ATG (GCG) (GCN) (GCA) GCG GGG GCT GCG…\n6 1-7 3\n41\nModels for OPMD Pathogenesis\n• PABPN1 is a ubiquitous protein that controls\nthe length of mRNA poly(A) tails, mRNA\nexport from the nucleus & alternative poly(A)\nsite usage\n• Currently two general models are used to\nexplain how alanine-expanded PABPN1\nconfers muscle pathology in autosomal\ndominant OPMD where patients have one\nnormal and one mutant allele of PABPN1\n• One model suggests that nuclear aggregates\ncause disease (right column, outlined in red)\n• A second model suggests that loss of PABPN1\nfunction (bottom row, outlined in blue)\nunderlies pathology\nBanerjee, A, FEBS J., 2013\n42\nBB-301 Inhibits the Production of the key Disease-Causing Protein in\nOPMD and Delivers a New, Fully-Functional Version of the Protein\n•\nBB-301 is a gene therapy designed by Benitec Biopharma Inc. to accomplish two goals:\nDesign of Lead Candida*te BB-301\n•\nReduce the production of the mutant (harmful) form of the PABPN1 protein in the\nmuscles of the throat\n•\nDeliver a new, functional gene to the muscles of the throat that will drive production of\nthe normal, healthy form of the PABPN1 protein\n•\nBB-301 contains 3 genes, 2 of which serve to reduce the production of the mutant form of\nthe PABPN1 protein in the treated muscles of the throat, and 1 gene that allows the treated\nmuscles to produce the normal, healthy PABPN1 protein\n•\nThese 3 genes are placed, or “encapsulated,” within a special virus (i.e., AAV9 vector)\ncoPABPN1 is Restoration of\ninsensitive to functional PABPN1\n•\nThe AAV9 vector used for BB-301 is part of a family of viruses called adeno-associated\nshRNA\nviruses (AAVs), and AAVs have been evaluated in hundreds of clinical research studies\n•\nIn preclinical efficacy studies for BB-301 carried out in the A17 mouse model, direct\nintramuscular injection of BB-301 facilitated increases in muscle cross-sectional area,\nincreases in muscle mass, and increases in muscle force generating capacity\n•\nIn Beagle dog studies, intramuscular injections of BB-301 into the pharyngeal

BB-301 in OPMD\nNormal vs. Disordered Swallowing Anatomical Structures of the Pharynx and BB-301 Injection Sites\n• Under normal conditions, a food bolus leaves the oral cavity and is able to traverse the\nlength of the pharynx, en route to the esophagus, via the propulsive activity of the\ncoordinated constriction of the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictor\nmuscles\n• As the food bolus nears the opening of the upper esophagus, the subsequent\nrelaxation of the cricopharyngeal muscle allows the bolus to enter the esophagus and\ntravel to the stomach\n• In OPMD, the pharyngeal constrictor muscles are weakened and atrophic and are\nunable to consistently exert the level of force required to support the propulsion of the\nfood or liquid bolus that defines the normal swallowing process\n• In the ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical research study, BB-301 is delivered by direct BB-301\nintramuscular injection to the weakened muscles of the pharynx\n• Restoration of muscle fiber size and muscle force generating capacity in the weakened\nand atrophic pharyngeal constrictor muscles of OPMD patients following BB-301\nadministration would be expected to meaningfully enhance the ability of the\npharyngeal constrictor muscles to support food and liquid bolus propulsion through\nthe pharynx and towards the esophagus, reducing dysphagia in OPMD patients\n49\nPrimary Source Data Verification\n• All safety data are confirmed via a process of Source Data Verification (SDV) approximately monthly\n• The SDV process entails a clinical representative of the Clinical Research Organization (CRO) visiting the clinical site and reviewing all\nprimary medical data entered into the medical record, the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF), and/or provided by associated\nclinical laboratories\n• The Benitec Clinical Team also verifies all safety data (e.g., clinical chemistries, hematologic assessments, thyroid function testing,\nurinalysis, and physical examination findings)\n• SDV for safety data is performed at this cadence as this is a first-in-human study with safety as the primary endpoint\n• Secondary endpoints (e.g., VFSS) are exploratory, and the assessment of the utility of the exploratory endpoints as\nfundamental indicators of disease progression or symptomatic improvement will be assessed at month 12 for each\nPhase 1b/2a Study Subject\n• In this regard, SDV of the primary data sources (e.g., the primary imaging and analytical data files which are used by the central\nreading team to populate the eCRF for all subjects screened and/or enrolled into BNTC-OPMD-NH-001 and BNTC-OPMD-BB-301-\n01) occurs after the month-12 assessment for each subject\n• In preparation for the 2024 World Muscle Society Annual Congress late-breaking oral presentation, the SDV process was initiated\nearly for Subjects 1 and 2\n50"
