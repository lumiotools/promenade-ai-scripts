Diluted earnings per common share were $0.50 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $0.42 for the second quarter of 2024 and $0.23 for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n[ ![First Community Corporation logo. \\(PRNewsFoto/First Community Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75839/first_community_corporation_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75839/first_community_corporation_logo.html)\n\nYear-to-date through September 30, 2024, net income was $9.723 million compared to $8.546 million during the first nine months of 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of 2024 were $1.26, compared to $1.12 during the same time period in 2023. \n\nAs a note, during the third quarter of 2023, the company sold $39.9 million of book value U.S. Treasuries in its available-for-sale investments portfolio and this sale created a one-time pre-tax loss of $1.2 million. \n\n**Cash Dividend and Capital**\n\nThe Board of Directors approved a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024. The company will pay a $0.15 per share dividend to holders of the company's common stock. This dividend is payable November 12, 2024 to shareholders of record as of October 29, 2024. Mike Crapps, First Community Corporation President and CEO, commented, \"Our entire board is pleased that our performance enables the company to continue its cash dividend for the 91st consecutive quarter.\" \n\nThe company's Board of Directors has approved a plan to utilize up to $7.1 million of capital to repurchase shares of its common stock, which represents approximately 5.0% of total shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2024. This share repurchase plan expires on May 13, 2025. Under the repurchase plan, the company may repurchase shares from time to time. No shares have been repurchased under this plan. Mr. Crapps noted, \"This approved share repurchase provides us with some flexibility in managing capital going forward.\" \n\nEach of the regulatory capital ratios for the bank exceed the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At September 30, 2024, the bank's regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 8.39%, 12.93%, and 14.00%, respectively. This compares to the same ratios as of September 30, 2023 of 8.63%, 12.47%, and 13.50%, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the bank's Common Equity Tier I ratio was 12.93% compared to 12.47% at September 30, 2023. Further, the company's Tangible Common Shareholders' Equity to Tangible Assets (TCE) ratio was 6.65% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 6.47% as of June 30, 2024, and 6.09% as of September 30, 2023. \n\nTangible Book Value (TBV) per common share was $16.78 at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.85 as of June 30, 2024, and $14.25 as of September 30, 2023. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nAsset quality metrics remained strong as of September 30, 2024. The non-performing assets ratio for the third quarter was 0.04% of total assets and a total past due ratio of 0.11% of total loans. Net charge-offs, including overdrafts, during the third quarter of 2024 were $68 thousand; excluding overdrafts net loan charge-offs were $45 thousand during the third quarter. Year-to-date through September 30, 2024 net loan charge-offs, including overdrafts, were $95 thousand and excluding overdrafts were $43 thousand. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO now stands at 1.15% of total bank regulatory risk-based capital as of September 30, 2024. \n\nAs a community bank focused on local businesses, professionals, organizations, and individuals, the bank has no individual or industry concentrations. In order to provide additional clarity to our commercial real estate exposure, the information below includes only non-owner occupied loans. \n\n_Collateral_ | _Outstanding_ | _% of Loan_ _Portfolio_ | _Average_ _Loan Size_ | Weighted Avg LTV of Top 10  _Loans_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nRetail | $98,701,793 | 8.2 % | $1,028,144 | 55 %  \nWarehouse & Industrial | $76,998,629 | 6.4 % | $793,800 | 60 %  \nOffice | $66,965,552 | 5.6 % | $690,367 | 58 %  \nHotel | $59,471,982 | 5.0 % | $3,498,352 | 57 %  \n  \nIt is worth noting that in our office exposure noted above, there are only four loans where the collateral is an office building in excess of 50,000 square feet of rentable space. These four loans represent $10.7 million in loan outstandings and have a weighted average loan-to-value of 33%. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal loans increased during the third quarter of 2024 by $7.5 million to $1.197 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.189 billion at June 30, 2024. Year-to-date through September 30, 2024, total loans increased $62.6 million, an annualized growth rate of 7.4%. Commercial loan production was $35.0 million and advances from unfunded commercial construction loans available for draws was $19.0 million during the third quarter of 2024. This compares to $42.6 million and $23.7 million, respectively, on a linked quarter basis. Loan payoffs and paydowns were up 67.4% on a linked quarter basis. First Community Bank President and CEO Ted Nissen noted, \"As anticipated, the combination of less production and higher payoffs resulted in less loan growth in the third quarter as compared to the first two quarters of 2024. However, we are pleased that our annualized growth rate for loans is still strong at 7.4%.\" \n\nTotal deposits increased $39.5 million during the third quarter to $1.644 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $1.605 billion at June 30, 2024. Pure deposits, which are defined as total deposits less certificates of deposits, increased $31.0 million on a linked quarter basis to $1.350 billion at September 30, 2024, an annualized growth rate of 9.4%. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are related to customer cash management accounts or business sweep accounts, were $66.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $7.6 million on a linked quarter basis, a 51.3% annualized growth rate. The bank began issuing brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement its funding mix. During the third quarter of 2024, brokered CDs declined from $42.9 million at June 30, 2024 to $22.4 million at September 30, 2024. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, were $1.622 billion at September 30, 2024 compared to $1.562 billion at June 30, 2024, which is an increase of $60 million for an annual growth rate of 15.3%. Costs of deposits were 2.03% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 1.98% in the second quarter of the year. Cost of funds increased on a linked quarter basis to 2.21% in the third quarter of 2024 from 2.17% in the second quarter of the year. The cumulative cycle betas, which represents trough to peak, for cost of deposits is 37.52% and for cost of funds is 40.19%. Non-interest bearing deposits decreased by $19.0 million on a linked quarter basis to $441.4 million or 26.8% of total deposits. However, it should be noted that average non-interest bearing deposits actually increased slightly during the quarter to $445.3 million from $443.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. Mr. Nissen commented, \"A strength of our bank has been and continues to be the value of our deposit franchise. Of the $39.5 million in total deposit growth in the third quarter of 2024, $31.0 million of that was in pure deposits, which are more relationship based than the more price sensitive certificates of deposit.\" \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the bank had uninsured deposits of $492.5 million, or 30.0%, of total bank deposits. Of those uninsured deposits, $88.3 million, or 5.4%, of total bank deposits were deposits of states or political subdivisions in the U.S. which are secured or collateralized. Total uninsured deposits, excluding these deposits that are secured or collateralized, were $404.3 million, or 24.6%, of total deposits at September 30, 2024. The average balance of all customer deposit accounts as of September 30, 2024 was $24,281. The average balance for consumer accounts was $13,152 and for non-consumer accounts was $52,782. All of the above points to the granularity and the quality of the bank's deposit franchise. \n\nThe bank has other short-term investments, primarily interest bearing cash at the Federal Reserve Bank, of $144.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $86.2 million at June 30, 2024. Further, the bank has additional sources of liquidity in the form of federal funds purchased lines of credit in the total amount of $77.5 million with three financial institutions and $10.0 million through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. There were $3.7 million in borrowings against these lines of credit as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe bank also has substantial borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta with an approved line of credit of up to 25% of assets. As of September 30, 2024, the bank had total availability of $471.1 million subject to collateral requirements. There were $50.0 million of FHLB advances with $421.1 million of remaining credit availability, subject to collateral requirements, at September 30, 2024.\n\nCombined, the company has total remaining credit availability, subject to collateral requirements, in excess of $505.0 million as compared to uninsured deposits (excluding deposits secured or collateralized as noted above) of $404.3 million. \n\nThe investment portfolio was $486.8 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $488.7 million at June 30, 2024. The yield decreased to 3.53% during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 3.66% in the second quarter of 2024. The effective duration of the available-for-sale portfolio was 3.4 at September 30, 2024. AOCL decreased to $23.2 million at September 30, 2024 from $27.3 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates.\n\n**_Revenue_**\n\n**Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.412 million, compared to $12.694 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $12.103 million for the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 2.96% compared to net interest margin of 2.93% in the second quarter of 2024. This expansion continues a positive trend of margin expansion in recent quarters. \n\nThe company continued to benefit from the yield on the loan portfolio increasing again this quarter, improving by 13 basis points to 5.73% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 5.60% in the prior quarter. Mr. Nissen commented, \"This increase in the loan portfolio yield was partially offset by the decrease in the investment portfolio yield, resulting in the average earning asset yield increasing by six basis points on a linked quarter basis to 5.10%.\"\n\nAs previously disclosed, effective May 5, 2023, the company entered into a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the \"Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement\") for a notional amount of $150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on May 5, 2026 and the company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58% while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by $681 thousand during the third quarter of 2024 and $1.997 million year-to-date through September 30, 2024. Loan yields and net interest margin both benefitted with an increase of 23 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively during the third quarter of 2024 and 24 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively, through September 30, 2024. \n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nTotal non-interest income was $3.570 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.642 million in the second quarter of the year and $1.864 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the loss on the sale of securities in the third quarter of 2023 discussed above, the total non-interest income for the third quarter of 2023 was $3.113 million. \n\nTotal production in the mortgage line of business in the third quarter of 2024 was $38.1 million which was comprised of $19.5 million in secondary market loans, $8.7 million in adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and $9.9 million in construction loans. This compares to production on a linked quarter of $49.0 million which was comprised of $22.7 million in secondary market loans, $14.6 million in ARMs, and $11.7 million in construction loans. Production in the third quarter of 2023 was $41.7 million which was comprised of $17.3 million in secondary market loans, $11.4 million in ARMs, and $13.0 million in construction loans. Fee revenue associated with the secondary market loans was $571 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.92%. \n\nTotal assets under management (AUM) in the investment advisory line of business were $901.6 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $865.6 million at June 30, 2024 and $755.4 million at December 31, 2023. Revenue in this line of business was $1.595 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.508 million in the second quarter of the year which is an increase of 5.8% on a linked quarter, and compared to $1.187 million in the third quarter of 2023 which is an increase of 34.4% year-over-year. \n\n**_Non-Interest Expense_**\n\nNon-interest expense was $11.991 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $11.843 million in the second quarter of the year. Marketing expense was $219 thousand higher on a linked quarter as planned due to a more extensive media schedule during the period. Salaries and Benefits expense was $119 thousand higher on a linked quarter primarily due to an increase in incentive accruals related to higher performance levels. Other expense was down $229 thousand in the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower legal fees and the reimbursement of some legal fees previously paid during the second quarter of 2024, as well as lower expenses related to Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) compared to the second quarter of 2024 which included a write down of an OREO property. \n\n**_Other_**\n\nThe company has previously announced the future retirement of Chief Operations and Risk Officer Tanya Butts. The company has selected Sarah Donley, the bank's Controller and a 27-year employee, as her successor following a substantial transition period. \n\n**_About First Community Corporation_**\n\nFirst Community Corporation stock trades on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"FCCO\" and is the holding company for First Community Bank, a local community bank based in the Midlands of South Carolina.

Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CH32074&sd=2024-10-16) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-community-corporation-announces-third-quarter-results-and-cash-dividend-302277472.html>\n\nSOURCE First Community Corporation\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n![First Community Logo Mark](//s26.q4cdn.com/899478308/files/images/irw/logo-mark.svg)\n\n## Direct Access to Real People\n\n### Talk to Us\n\n800.829.6372\n\n### Visit Us\n\n[Locations](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Locations)\n\n### Connect with Us\n\n[Contact](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Contact)\n"

Diluted earnings per common share were $0.42 for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $0.34 in the first quarter of 2024 and $0.43 for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n[ ![First Community Corporation logo. \\(PRNewsFoto/First Community Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75839/first_community_corporation_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/75839/first_community_corporation_logo.html)\n\nYear-to-date through June 30, 2024, net income was $5.862 million compared to $6.790 million during the first six months of 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the first half of 2024 were $0.76, compared to $0.89 during the same time period in 2023. \n\n**Cash Dividend and Capital**\n\nThe Board of Directors approved an increased cash dividend for the second quarter of 2024. The company will pay a $0.15 per share dividend to holders of the company's common stock. This dividend is payable August 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of July 30, 2024. First Community Corporation President and CEO Mike Crapps commented, \"Our entire board is pleased that our performance enables the company to continue its cash dividend for the 90th consecutive quarter.\" \n\nAs previously announced on May 14, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors has approved a plan to utilize up to $7.1 million of capital to repurchase shares of its common stock, which represents approximately 5.3% of total shareholders' equity as of March 31, 2024. This new share repurchase plan expires on May 13, 2025. Under the repurchase plan, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time. No shares have been repurchased under this plan. Crapps noted, \"This approved share repurchase provides us with some flexibility in managing capital going forward.\" \n\nEach of the regulatory capital ratios for the bank exceed the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At June 30, 2024, the bank's regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 8.44%, 12.55%, and 13.62%, respectively. This compares to the same ratios as of June 30, 2023 of 8.63%, 13.29%, and 14.35%, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, the bank's Common Equity Tier I ratio was 12.55% compared to 13.29% at June 30, 2023. The Company's Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets ratio (TCE ratio) was 6.47% at June 30, 2024, compared to 6.32% at March 31, 2024 and 6.31% at June 30, 2023. \n\nTangible Book Value (TBV) per share increased during the quarter to $15.85 per share at June 30, 2024, from $15.51 per share as of March 31, 2024 and $14.33 as of June 30, 2023. \n\n**Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses**\n\nThe company's asset quality metrics as of June 30, 2024 were excellent. The non-performing assets ratio as of June 30, 2024 was 0.04% and the total past dues ratio was 0.07%. Non-accrual loans were $173 thousand, which is 0.01% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. During the second quarter of 2024, the bank had net charge-offs, including overdrafts, of $5 thousand and net loan recoveries, excluding overdrafts, of $1 thousand. Year-to-date through June 30, 2024, net charge-offs, including overdrafts, were $27 thousand and net loan recoveries, excluding overdrafts, were $2 thousand. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO now stands at 1.21% of total bank regulatory risk-based capital as of June 30, 2024. Provision expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $454 thousand with $328 thousand related to growth in the loan portfolio and the remainder due to a slight extension in the average life of the portfolio due to lower loan prepayments.\n\nAs a community bank focused on local businesses, professionals, organizations, and individuals, the bank has no individual or industry concentrations. In order to provide additional clarity to our commercial real estate exposure, the information below includes only non-owner occupied loans. As of June 30, 2024:\n\n_Collateral_ | _Outstanding_ | _% of Loan_ _Portfolio_ | _Average_ _Loan Size_ | WeightedAvg LTVof Top 10 _Loans_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nRetail | $91,549,392 | 7.7 % | $995,102 | 55 %  \nWarehouse & Industrial | $78,006,255 | 6.6 % | $804,188 | 61 %  \nOffice | $66,359,134 | 5.6 % | $713,539 | 57 %  \nHotel | $65,178,549 | 5.5 % | $3,621,030 | 63 %  \n  \nIn the office exposure noted above, there are only four loans where the collateral is an office building in excess of 50,000 square feet of rentable space. These four loans represent $10.6 million in loan outstandings and have a weighted average loan-to-value of 34%. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal loans increased during the second quarter of 2024 by $31.9 million, which is an annualized growth rate of 11.1%. This increase is a result of growth in the commercial loan portfolio of $14.2 million, growth in the residential mortgage portfolio of $12.9 million, and growth in the consumer loan portfolio of $4.8 million. Commercial loan production was $42.6 million during the second quarter compared to $27.8 million in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, growth was aided by advances from unfunded commercial construction loans available for draws of $23.7 million during the second quarter of 2024. Also early loan payoffs and paydowns declined during the quarter.\n\nTotal deposits were $1.605 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $1.578 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $26.5 million, a 6.7% annualized growth rate. The bank began issuing brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement its funding mix. During the second quarter of 2024 brokered CDs declined from $60.5 million at March 31, 2024 to $42.9 million at June 30, 2024, as the bank called a $17.7 million brokered certificate of deposit with an all-in cost of 5.70% on April 25, 2024. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, were $1.562 billion at June 30, 2024 compared to $1.518 billion at March 31, 2024, with an annual growth rate, excluding brokered deposits, of 11.7%. Pure deposits, which are defined as total deposits less certificates of deposits, increased $20.3 million during the second quarter of 2024, to $1.319 billion at June 30, 2024, a 6.3% annualized growth rate. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $17.1 million to $460.4 million during the quarter and at June 30, 2024 represented 28.7% of total deposits. This compares to 28.1% as of March 31, 2024. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are related to customer cash management accounts or business sweep accounts, were $59.3 million at June 30, 2024. \n\nCosts of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.98% in the second quarter of 2024 from 1.90% in the first quarter of 2024. Cost of funds increased just 0.01% on a linked quarter basis to 2.17% in the second quarter of 2024 from 2.16% in the first quarter of 2024. As additional information, the cost of deposits were 1.95% in the month of March 2024 and 1.97% in the month of June 2024. Cost of funds were 2.18% in the month of March 2024 and 2.15% in the month of June 2024. This decline in cost of funds was due to an improved mix including a reduction in wholesale funding and growth in pure deposits which includes non-interest bearing deposits. The cumulative cycle betas through April 2024, which represent trough to peak, for cost of deposits is 36.76% and for cost of funds is 40.00%. As of June 30, 2024, cumulative cycle betas for cost of deposits is 36.00% and for cost of funds is 38.67%. Ted Nissen, President and CEO of First Community Bank, commented, \"A strength of our bank has been and continues to be the value of our deposit franchise. In the second quarter of 2024, we saw growth in total deposits, pure deposits and non-interest bearing deposits. While we did see an increase in cost of deposits during the quarter, cost of funds was almost flat on a linked quarter.\"\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the bank had uninsured deposits of $460.0 million, or 28.7%, of total bank deposits. Of those uninsured deposits, $93.5 million, or 5.8%, of total bank deposits were deposits of states or political subdivisions in the U.S. which are secured or collateralized. Total uninsured deposits, excluding these deposits that are secured or collateralized, were $366.4 million, or 22.8%, of total deposits at June 30, 2024. The average balance of all customer deposit accounts as of June 30, 2024 was $28,532. The average balance for consumer accounts was $15,008 and for non-consumer accounts was $63,038. All of the above point to the granularity and the quality of the bank's deposit franchise. \n\nThe bank has other short-term investments, primarily interest bearing cash at the Federal Reserve Bank, of $86.2 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $122.8 million at March 31, 2024. Further, the bank has additional sources of liquidity in the form of federal funds purchased lines of credit in the total amount of $77.5 million with three financial institutions and $10.0 million through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. There were no borrowings against the above lines of credit as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe bank also has substantial borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta with an approved line of credit of up to 25% of assets. As of June 30, 2024, the bank had FHLB advances of $50.0 million, which was a reduction of $10 million during the second quarter of 2024. Therefore, the bank has remaining credit availability under this facility of $421.5 million, subject to collateral requirements.\n\nCombined, at June 30, 2024, the company has total remaining credit availability in excess of $509.0 million as compared to non-secured or non-collateralized uninsured deposits of $366.4 million as noted above. \n\nThe investment portfolio was $488.7 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $495.1 million at March 31, 2024 with a yield of 3.66% in the second quarter of 2024. The effective duration of the total investment portfolio is relatively low at 3.8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) improved to $27.3 million at June 30, 2024 from $27.4 million at March 31, 2024.\n\nMr. Nissen commented, \"We are extremely excited about the success in the growth of loans and deposits during the second quarter. This is reflective of the hard work of our team and the high quality of our customers and markets.\" \n\n**_Revenue_**\n\n**Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income was $12.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to first quarter of 2024 net interest income of $12.1 million and $12.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. Second quarter of 2024 net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 2.93% compared to 2.79% in the first quarter of the year, up 14 basis points on a linked quarter. Crapps commented, \"We believe we had an inflection point in margin on a non-taxable equivalent basis in February of 2024 with four consecutive months of margin expansion from 2.77% in February of 2024 to 2.96% in June of 2024. This increase in margin is due to a continued increase in the yields on loans and an improved earning asset mix with a higher percentage of loans along with a flattening and reduction of the cost of funds and cost of deposits as noted above.\"\n\nAs previously disclosed, effective May 5, 2023, the company entered into a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the \"Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement\") for a notional amount of $150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on May 5, 2026 and the company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58% while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by $668 thousand during the second quarter of 2024 and $1.3 million year-to-date through June 30, 2024. Loan yields and net interest margin both benefitted with an increase of 24 basis points and 16 basis points, respectively during the second quarter and year-to-date through June 30, 2024. \n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nNon-interest income in the second quarter of 2024 was $3.642 million, compared to $3.184 million in the first quarter of 2024 and $3.051 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 14.4% and 19.4%, respectively. \n\nTotal production in the mortgage line of business in the second quarter of 2024 was $49.0 million which was the highest quarter since 2020 and was comprised of $22.7 million in secondary market loans, $14.6 million in adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and $11.7 million in construction loans. Fee revenue from the mortgage line of business was $659 thousand for the second quarter of 2024 which includes $655 thousand associated with the secondary market loans with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.89%. This compares to production year-over-year of $32.3 million which was comprised of $12.9 million in secondary market loans, $5.7 million in ARMs, and $13.7 million in construction loans. Fee revenue associated with the secondary market loans in the second quarter of 2023 was $371 thousand with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.87%. Mr. Crapps noted, \"During the quarter, we saw an increase in demand for secondary market loans as we also continue to have success with our adjustable rate mortgage and construction loan products. As the adjustable rate and construction loans are held on our balance sheet, the immediate result is less gain-on-sale revenue, but additional loan growth and interest income. Additionally, this is building a pipeline for future gain-on-sale revenue when the interest rate environment changes.\" \n\nTotal assets under management (AUM) in the investment advisory line of business were $865.6 million at June 30, 2024 from $832.9 million at March 31, 2024 and $755.4 million at December 31, 2023. This record in AUM is driven by a combination of net new asset growth and market appreciation. Revenue in this line of business was $1.508 million in the second quarter of 2024, up from $1.358 million at March 31, 2024 and $1.081 million in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11.0% and 39.5%, respectively. \n\nOther non-recurring non-interest income during the second quarter of 2024 was $95 thousand that includes a $101 thousand gain on insurance proceeds which was partially offset by a $5 thousand loss on disposition of assets on the closing of the downtown Augusta banking office. \n\n**_Non-Interest Expense_**\n\nNon-interest expense was $11.843 million in the second quarter of 2024 an increase of $38 thousand over the first quarter of the year. Salaries and benefits expense increased $202 thousand on a linked quarter due to higher variable compensation expenses in the mortgage and financial planning lines of business and the full quarter impact of annual increases for exempt employees which were effective on March 1, 2024. The Other expense category increased $107 thousand on a linked quarter basis due to an increase in shareholder and transfer agent expense of $45 thousand and higher professional fees of $43 thousand primarily related to increased audit and accounting fees. Other real estate expenses were up $78 thousand in the second quarter of 2024 due to a write down of an OREO property. The FDIC assessment increased $24 thousand on a linked quarter. All of the above were offset by a decrease in marketing expense in the amount of $308 thousand.\n\nOn a related note, the effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 19.16% compared to 21.66% in the second quarter of 2023 and 21.94% in the first quarter of 2024. The reduction in the effective tax rate this quarter was due to a non-recurring tax adjustment of $149 thousand.\n\n**_Other_**\n\nIn December of 2023, First Community announced certain promotions and additions to its Executive Leadership Team designed to preserve the bank's culture and prepare for its long term success and sustainability. Notably, this included that effective July 1, 2024, J. Ted Nissen assumed the role of CEO of First Community Bank while still retaining the role of president and has also joined the First Community board of directors. Michael C. \"Mike\" Crapps continues in his role as president and CEO of First Community Corporation.

The company has three other banking offices in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) including locations in Augusta and Evans, Georgia and Aiken South Carolina.

Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CH63218&sd=2024-07-17) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-community-corporation-announces-second-quarter-results-and-increased-cash-dividend-302199064.html>\n\nSOURCE First Community Corporation\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n![First Community Logo Mark](//s26.q4cdn.com/899478308/files/images/irw/logo-mark.svg)\n\n## Direct Access to Real People\n\n### Talk to Us\n\n800.829.6372\n\n### Visit Us\n\n[Locations](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Locations)\n\n### Connect with Us\n\n[Contact](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Contact)\n"

Assets under management (AUM) were a record $832.9 million at March 31, 2024, which is a 10.3% increase as compared to the December 31, 2023 AUM amount of $755.4 million.\n  * Mortgage line of business fee revenue of $425 thousand, which includes $418 thousand in gain-on-sale revenue.\n  * Cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, the 89th consecutive quarter of cash dividends paid to common shareholders.\n\n\n\nToday, First Community Corporation (Nasdaq: FCCO), the holding company for First Community Bank, announced earnings and discussed the results of operations and the company's activities during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFirst Community reported net income for the first quarter of 2024 of $2.597 million with diluted earnings per common share of $0.34. This compares to net income and diluted earnings per common share of $3.463 million and $0.45, respectively, year-over-year and $3.297 million and $0.43, respectively, on a linked quarter basis. \n\n**_Cash Dividend and Capital_**\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend for the first quarter of 2024 of $0.14 per common share. This dividend is payable on May 14, 2024 to shareholders of record of the company's common stock as of April 30, 2024. First Community President and CEO, Mike Crapps commented, \"The entire board is pleased that our performance enables the company to continue its cash dividend for the 89th consecutive quarter.\" \n\nEach of the regulatory capital ratios for the bank exceed the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At March 31, 2024, the bank's regulatory capital ratios, Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based, were 8.35%, 12.65%, and 13.71%, respectively. This compares to the same ratios as of March 31, 2023 of 8.68%, 13.55%, and 14.63%, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the bank's Common Equity Tier One ratio was 12.65% compared to 13.55% at March 31, 2023. The bank's Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets ratio (TCE ratio) was 6.32% at March 31, 2024 compared to 6.39% at December 31, 2023 and 6.29% as of March 31, 2023. \n\nTangible Book Value (TBV) per share increased during the quarter to $15.51 per share at March 31, 2024, from $15.23 per share as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**_Loan Portfolio Quality/Allowance for Loan Losses_**\n\nThe company's asset quality remains excellent. The non-performing assets (NPAs) were 0.04% of total assets at March 31, 2024, with $835 thousand in NPAs, which compares to 0.05% and $864 thousand at December 31, 2023. The past due ratio for all loans was 0.04% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.06% at December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the bank had net charge-offs, including overdrafts, of $22 thousand and net loan recoveries, excluding overdrafts, of $1,000. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO is 1.21% of total bank regulatory risk-based capital at March 31, 2024. \n\nAs a community bank focused on local businesses, professionals, organizations, and individuals, the bank has no individual or industry concentrations. In order to provide additional clarity to our commercial real estate exposure, the information below includes only non-owner occupied loans. As of March 31, 2024:\n\n_Collateral_ | _Outstanding_ | _% of Loan Portfolio_ | _Average_ _Loan Size_ | Weighted Avg LTV of Top 10 _Loans_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nRetail | $92,502,264 |  8.0 % | $953,632 | 56 %  \nWarehouse & Industrial | $78,820,246 |  6.8 % | $821,044 | 59 %  \nOffice | $65,329,352 |  5.6 % | $673,498 | 62 %  \nHotel | $65,677,393 |  5.7 % | $3,648,744 | 61 %  \n  \nIn the office exposure noted above, there are only four loans where the collateral is an office building in excess of 50,000 square feet of rentable space. These four loans represent $10.4 million in loan outstandings and have a weighted average loan-to-value of 33%. \n\n**_Balance Sheet_**\n\nTotal deposits were $1.578 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to $1.511 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of $67.1 million, a 17.9% annualized growth rate. The bank began issuing brokered certificates of deposit during the third quarter of 2023 to supplement its funding mix. As of March 31, 2024, the company had $60.5 million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in initial terms from one year to three years, with the three year terms callable after six months. The bank has provided notice that it will call a $17.7 million brokered certificate of deposit with an all-in cost of 5.70% on April 25, 2024. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, were $1.518 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to $1.463 billion at December 31, 2023, with an annual growth rate, excluding brokered deposits, of 15.0%. Pure deposits, which are defined as total deposits less certificates of deposits, increased $13.1 million during the first quarter of 2024, to $1.298 billion at March 31, 2024, a 4.1% annualized growth rate. Non-interest bearing accounts increased during the quarter to $443.3 million, a 10.2% annualized increase, and were 28.1% of total deposits. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are related to customer cash management accounts or business sweep accounts, were $81.8 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $19.0 million due to a typical seasonal increase in one relationship. \n\nCosts of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.90% in the first quarter of 2024 from 1.69% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of funds also increased on a linked quarter basis to 2.16% in the first quarter of 2024 from 1.97% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The cumulative cycle deposit beta for cost of deposits is 35.62% and for cost of funds is 39.24%. Mr. Crapps commented, \"A strength of our bank has been and continues to be the value of our deposit franchise. In the first quarter of 2024, we saw increases in total deposits, total customer deposits, non-interest bearing deposits, pure deposits, and cash management and sweep accounts. We continued to experience pressure on interest rates for interest bearing deposits as a result of the current rate environment, and thus we saw increases in our cost of deposits and cost of funds.\"\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the bank had uninsured deposits of $470.0 million, or 29.8%, of total bank deposits. Of those uninsured deposits, $94.4 million, or 6.0%, of total bank deposits were deposits of states or political subdivisions in the U.S. which are secured or collateralized. Total uninsured deposits, excluding these deposits that are secured or collateralized, were $375.6 million, or 23.8%, of total deposits at March 31, 2024. The average balance of all customer deposit accounts as of March 31, 2024 was $28,025. The average balance for consumer accounts was $15,073 and for non-consumer accounts was $61,512. \n\nThe bank has other short-term investments, primarily interest bearing cash at the Federal Reserve Bank, of $122.8 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $66.8 million at December 31, 2023. Further, the bank has additional sources of liquidity in the form of federal funds purchased lines of credit in the total amount of $75.0 million with three financial institutions and $10.0 million through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. There were no borrowings against the above lines of credit as of March 31, 2024.\n\nThe bank also has substantial borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta with an approved line of credit of up to 25% of assets. FHLB advances declined $30.0 million to $60.0 million at March 31, 2024 from $90.0 million at December 31, 2023. Therefore, the bank has remaining credit availability under this facility in excess of $396.9 million, subject to collateral requirements.\n\nCombined, at March 31, 2024, the company had total remaining credit availability, subject to collateral requirements, in excess of $481.9 million as compared to uninsured deposits of $375.6 million, excluding deposits that are secured or collateralized, as noted above. \n\nThe investment portfolio was $495.1 million at March 31, 2024 as compared to $506.2 million at December 31, 2023. The yield increased to 3.66% during the first quarter of 2024 as compared to 3.59% in the fourth quarter of 2023. The effective duration of the total investment portfolio is 3.9 at March 31, 2024. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) improved to $27.4 million at March 31, 2024 from $28.2 million at December 31, 2023, primarily due to a reduction in unrealized losses on floating rate securities as a result of a decrease in short term interest rates and the amortization of the unrealized net holding loss on held-to-maturity investments. \n\nTotal loans increased by $23.3 million in the first quarter of 2024, to $1.157 billion at March 31, 2024 compared to $1.134 billion at December 31, 2023, which is an 8.3% annualized growth rate. This increase is the result of growth in the residential mortgage portfolio of $12.6 million and the commercial loan portfolio of $13.8 million, slightly offset by a decrease in the consumer portfolio. Ted Nissen, First Community Bank President and Chief Banking Officer, noted, \"We are pleased with our loan activity during the first quarter. While the pipeline for new loan production is not as strong as in recent months, it does remain stable and we have unfunded commercial construction loans available for draws of $58.9 million at March 31, 2024.\" \n\n_**Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin**_\n\nNet interest income was $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, was 2.79% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 2.89 % in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 3.19% in the first quarter of 2023. Net interest margin was relatively stable during the past four months which saw net interest margin, on a non taxable equivalent basis, of 2.81% in December of 2023 and 2.79%, 2.77%, and 2.79% in January, February, and March of 2024, respectively. \n\nAs previously disclosed, effective May 5, 2023, the company entered into a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the \"Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement\") for a notional amount of $150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on May 5, 2026 and the company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58% while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by $649 thousand during the first quarter of 2024. Loan yields and net interest margin both benefitted with an increase of 23 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively during the first quarter. \n\n_**Non-Interest Income**_\n\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $3.184 million, compared to $2.931 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.575 million in the first quarter of 2023. Total production in the mortgage line of business in the first quarter of 2024 was $36.64 million which was comprised of $13.07 million in secondary market loans, $9.66 million in adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), and $13.91 million in construction loans. Fee revenue from the mortgage line of business was $425 thousand for the first quarter of 2024 which includes $418 thousand associated with the secondary market loans with a gain-on-sale margin of 3.20%. This compares to production year-over-year of $23.09 million which was comprised of $5.21 million in secondary market loans, $5.38 million in ARMs, and $12.5 million in construction loans during the first quarter of 2023. Fee revenue associated with the secondary market loans in the first quarter of 2023 was $155 thousand with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.97%. Mr. Crapps noted, \"The bank continues to have success with its adjustable rate mortgage and construction loan products, with continued activity in secondary market loans. While we are still experiencing the headwinds of a higher interest rate environment and low housing inventory, we are encouraged by recent trends.\"\n\nRevenue from the financial planning and investment advisory line of business was $1.358 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.176 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.067 million in the first quarter of 2023. Assets Under Management (AUM) reached a company record of $832.9 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $755.4 million at December 31, 2023 and $621.1 million at March 31, 2023. \n\n_**Non-Interest Expense**_\n\nNon-interest expense increased $1.125 million on a linked quarter basis to $11.805 million in the first quarter of 2024 from $10.680 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Salaries and Benefits expense was up $689 thousand on a linked quarter basis primarily due to $389 thousand in higher incentive accruals at target payout levels compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 which had reduced accruals to match lower anticipated payout levels, $165 thousand in higher payroll taxes which is typical earlier in the year, higher salaries related to promotions and annual merit increases as well as higher commissions in the financial planning line of business related to increased production on a linked quarter, and increased medical insurance expense for the new plan year. Marketing and public relations expense was up $395 thousand on a linked quarter basis due to higher media placements in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Marketing expenses, while planned and budgeted on an annual basis, can vary significantly between quarters depending on the needs of the company. Other Expense was up $127 thousand due to higher attorney fees in the first quarter of 2024, an increase in fraud and debit card losses on a linked quarter, and core banking and software expense related to new services. \n\n_**Other**_\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the company announced plans to close its banking office located at 771 Broad Street in downtown Augusta, Georgia. The effective date of this closing is June 27, 2024. The company has three other banking offices in the Central Savannah River Area (CSRA) including locations in Augusta and Evans, Georgia and Aiken South Carolina. First Community Bank President and Chief Banking Officer, Ted Nissen, commented, \"After careful analysis, we made the decision to close this location. We are excited to continue serving the businesses and professionals in the CSRA from our other local banking offices and through our mobile and online services.\" Cost savings are estimated to be $327 thousand annually going forward. \n\n**_About First Community Corporation_**\n\nFirst Community Corporation stock trades on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"FCCO\" and is the holding company for First Community Bank, a local community bank based in the Midlands of South Carolina.

Total deposit growth, excluding brokered CDs, of $77.5 million during the year of 2023, a 5.6% growth rate and $19.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, a 5.2% annualized growth rate.\n  * Total loan growth of $153.2 million, or 15.6%, during the year of 2023 and $42.4 million, or 3.9%, during the fourth quarter of the year, an annualized growth rate of 15.4%.\n  * Key credit quality metrics continue to be excellent with 2023 net recoveries of $6 thousand; net loan recoveries, excluding overdrafts, of $55 thousand; non-performing assets of 0.05%; and past due loans of 0.06% at year-end 2023.\n  * Investment advisory revenue of $1.176 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $4.511 million for the year of 2023. Assets under management (AUM) were $755.4 million at December 31, 2023, up from $674.5 million at September 30, 2023 and $558.8 million at December 31, 2022.\n  * Cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, the 88th consecutive quarter of cash dividends paid to common shareholders.\n\n\n\nToday, First Community Corporation (Nasdaq: FCCO), the holding company for First Community Bank, reported net income for the fourth quarter and year end of 2023. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.297 million and diluted earnings per common share were $0.43 compared to $4.043 million and $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.756 million and $0.23 in the third quarter of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $11.843 million compared to $14.613 million in 2022. Diluted earnings per common share were $1.55 for 2023 compared to $1.92 in 2022. \n\nAs previously reported, during the third quarter of 2023, the company sold $39.9 million of book value U.S. Treasuries in its available-for-sale portfolio. While this sale created a one-time pre-tax loss of $1.2 million, it provided additional liquidity which is being used primarily to fund loan growth. The weighted average book yield of the securities sold was 1.75% and the projected earn back period is 1.6 years. This transitions the balance sheet to be more efficient, improves net interest margin, and positions the company for higher earnings in the future. \n\n**_Cash Dividend and Capital_ **\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $0.14 per common share. This dividend is payable on February 20, 2024 to shareholders of record of the company's common stock as of February 6, 2024. First Community President and CEO, Mike Crapps commented, \"The entire board is pleased that our performance enables the company to continue our cash dividend uninterrupted for 88 consecutive quarters.\" \n\nAs previously announced, the company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan that provides for the repurchase of up to 375,000 shares of its common stock, which represented approximately 5% of the company's 7,606,172 shares outstanding on December 31, 2023. The repurchase plan expired at the market close on December 31, 2023 and no shares were repurchased under this plan. \n\nEach of the regulatory capital ratios for the bank exceed the well capitalized minimum levels currently required by regulatory statute. At December 31, 2023, the bank's regulatory capital ratios (Leverage, Tier I Risk Based and Total Risk Based) were 8.45%, 12.53%, and 13.58%, respectively. This compares to the same ratios as of December 31, 2022 of 8.63%, 13.49%, and 14.54%, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the bank's Common Equity Tier One ratio was 12.53% compared to 13.49% at December 31, 2022. Further, the company's Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets (TCE) ratio was 6.39% as of December 31, 2023 compared to 6.09% at September 30, 2023 and 6.21% as of December 31, 2022. \n\nTangible Book Value (TBV) per share increased during the quarter from $14.25 per share as of September 30, 2023 to $15.23 per share as of December 31, 2023. \n\n**_Asset Quality_ **\n\nThe company's asset quality remains excellent. The non-performing assets (NPAs) were 0.05% of total assets at December 31, 2023 with $864 thousand in NPAs compared to 0.04% at September 30, 2023. The past due ratio for all loans was 0.06% at year-end 2023, unchanged from September 30, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the bank experienced net recoveries of $1 thousand with overall net recoveries for the year of 2023 of $6 thousand. Net loan recoveries excluding overdrafts were $14 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2023, with overall net loan recoveries excluding overdrafts for the year of 2023 of $55 thousand. The ratio of classified loans plus OREO now stands at 1.25% of total bank regulatory risk-based capital as of December 31, 2023 compared to 1.17% on a linked quarter and 4.47% at the end of 2022. \n\nAs a community bank focused on local businesses, professionals, organizations, and individuals, the bank has no individual or industry concentrations. In order to provide additional clarity to our commercial real estate exposure, the information below includes only non-owner occupied loans. As of December 31, 2023:\n\n_Collateral_ |  _Outstanding_ |  _% of Loan_ _Portfolio_ |  _Average_ _Loan Size_ |  Weighted Avg LTV of Top 10 _Loans_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nRetail |  $88,937,718 |  7.8 % |  $966,714 |  57 %  \nWarehouse & Industrial |  $77,759,508 |  6.9 % |  $827,229 |  60 %  \nOffice |  $66,187,479 |  5.8 % |  $675,382 |  62 %  \nHotel |  $64,924,446 |  5.7 % |  $3,606,914 |  63 %  \n  \nIt is worth noting that in our office exposure noted above, there are only four loans where the collateral is an office building in excess of 50,000 square feet of rentable space. These four loans represent $10.4 million in loan outstandings and have a weighted average loan-to-value of 33%. \n\n**_Balance Sheet_ **\n\nTotal loans increased during the fourth quarter of 2023 by $42.4 million to $1.134 billion at December 31, 2023, compared to $1.092 billion at September 30, 2023, which is an annualized growth rate of 15.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, loan growth was $153.2 million which is a 15.6% annual growth rate. Commercial loan production was $41.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 and $166.3 million for the year of 2023 with advances of unfunded commercial construction loans of $23.3 million during the quarter and $100.9 million during the year. Loan payoffs and paydowns in 2023 were down approximately 51% compared to 2022. First Community Bank President Ted Nissen noted, \"Loan growth was strong in 2023; a combination of loan production and advances of unfunded commercial loans available for draws in addition to lower loan payoffs and paydowns all contributed to this growth.\" \n\nAt December 31, 2023, total deposits were $1.511 billion compared to $1.385 billion at December 31, 2022, an annual growth rate of 9.1%. As previously reported, to secure a cost effective stable funding source, during the third quarter of 2023, the company issued $48.2 million in brokered certificates of deposit ranging in terms from six months to three years, with the three year term callable after six months. Total deposits, excluding brokered deposits, were $1.463 billion at December 31, 2023. The annual deposit growth rate, excluding brokered deposits, was 5.6%. Pure deposits, which are defined as total deposits less certificates of deposits, increased to $1.285 billion at December 31, 2023 from $1.281 billion at December 31, 2022. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are related to customer cash management accounts or business sweep accounts, were $62.9 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $68.7 million at December 31, 2022. Total deposits increased to $1.511 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $1.492 billion at September 30, 2023. Pure deposits were $1.285 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to $1.289 billion at September 30, 2023. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $62.9 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $67.2 million at September 30, 2023. Costs of deposits increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.69% in the fourth quarter from 1.32% in the third quarter of 2023. Cost of funds also increased on a linked quarter basis to 1.97% in the fourth quarter of 2023 from 1.64% in the third quarter of the year. The cumulative cycle deposit beta for cost of deposits is 32.00% and for cost of funds is 36.57%. Non-interest bearing deposits were $432.3 million, or 28.6% of total deposits, and 29.6% of total deposits excluding the brokered deposits, at December 31, 2023. Mr. Crapps commented, \"A strength of our bank has been and continues to be the value of our deposit franchise. During the fourth quarter of 2023, as a result of the current rate environment, we continued to experience pressure on interest rates for interest bearing deposits, and some shift in the mix of deposits as our growth was in interest bearing deposit accounts. Thus, we saw increases in our cost of deposits and cost of funds.\"\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, including brokered CDs, the bank had uninsured deposits of $436.6 million, or 28.9%, of total bank deposits. Of those uninsured deposits, $82.8 million, or 5.5%, of total bank deposits were deposits of states or political subdivisions in the U.S. which are secured or collateralized. Total uninsured deposits, excluding these deposits that are secured or collateralized, were $353.8 million, or 23.4%, of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The average balance of all customer deposit accounts as of December 31, 2023 was $27,843. The average balance for consumer accounts was $14,995 and for non-consumer accounts was $61,570. All of the above points to the granularity and the quality of the bank's deposit franchise. \n\nThe bank has other short-term investments, primarily interest bearing cash at the Federal Reserve Bank, of $66.8 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $69.7 million at September 30, 2023. Further, the bank has additional sources of liquidity in the form of federal funds purchased lines of credit in the total amount of $85.0 million with four financial institutions and $10.0 million through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. There were no borrowings against these lines of credit as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe bank also has substantial borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta with an approved line of credit of up to 25% of assets. As of December 31, 2023, the bank had FHLB advances of $90.0 million. Therefore, having remaining credit availability under this facility in excess of $358.9 million, subject to collateral requirements.\n\nCombined, the company has total remaining credit availability in excess of $453.9 million as compared to uninsured deposits (excluding deposits secured or collateralized as noted above) of $353.8 million. \n\nThe investment portfolio was $506.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $506.8 million at September 30, 2023. The yield increased to 3.59% during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 3.42% in the third quarter of 2023. The effective duration of the total investment portfolio is 3.8 at December 31, 2023. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) improved to $28.2 million at December 31, 2023 from $33.1 million at September 30, 2023 due to an increase in market interest rates.\n\nMr. Crapps commented, \"We are extremely excited about the success in the growth of our loan portfolio during 2023. This is reflective of the hard work of our team and the high quality of our customers and markets. Additionally, our successful deposit franchise continues to be a strength for our company as demonstrated by the stability of our deposit base during the year.\" \n\n**_Revenue_ **\n\n**Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income for the year of 2023 increased 2.0% to $48.9 million compared to $47.9 million for the year of 2022. On a linked quarter basis, net interest income increased to $12.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 from $12.1 million in the third quarter of the year, an increase of 1.6%. The net interest margin, on a taxable equivalent basis, was 2.89% for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 2.96% in the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin contraction of 7 basis points was fairly consistent with the prior quarter contraction of 6 basis points. These levels are significantly less than the contraction we experienced earlier in 2023. \n\nAs previously disclosed, effective May 5, 2023, the company entered into a pay-fixed/receive-floating interest rate swap (the \"Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement\") for a notional amount of $150.0 million that was designated as a fair value hedge to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate loans included in the closed loan portfolio. This fair value hedge converts the hedged loans from a fixed rate to a synthetic floating SOFR rate. The Pay-Fixed Swap Agreement will mature on May 5, 2026 and the company will pay a fixed coupon rate of 3.58% while receiving the overnight SOFR rate. This interest rate swap positively impacted interest on loans by $674 thousand during the fourth quarter and $1.6 million through December 31, 2023. Loan yields and net interest margin both benefitted with an increase of 25 basis points and 16 basis points, respectively during the fourth quarter and 16 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively, through December 31, 2023. \n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nTotal non-interest income was $2.931 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.864 million in the third quarter of the year and $2.513 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total non-interest income, for the year of 2023 was $10.421 million, compared to 2022 non-interest income of $11.569 million. Impacting non-interest income in the third quarter of 2023 was a $1.249 million loss on the sale of securities as discussed above. \n\nTotal production in the mortgage line of business in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $38.62 million which was comprised of $14.3 million in secondary market loans, $10.0 million in adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) and $14.4 million in construction loans. Fee revenue associated with the secondary market loans was $372 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2023 with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.61%. This compares to production on a linked quarter of $41.7 million which was comprised of $17.3 million in secondary market loans, $11.4 million in ARMs, and $13.0 million in construction loans. Fee revenue associated with the secondary market loans in the third quarter of 2023 was $508 thousand with a gain-on-sale margin of 2.93%. Mr. Crapps noted, \"The bank continues to have success with its adjustable rate mortgage and construction loan products. While we are still experiencing the headwinds of a higher interest rate environment and low housing inventory, we are encouraged by recent trends.\" \n\nRevenue in the investment advisory line of business was $1.176 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.187 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $1.033 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue in the investment advisory line of business in 2023 was $4.511 million compared to $4.479 million in 2022. AUM ended 2023 at $755.4 million compared to $674.5 million at September 30, 2023 and $558.8 million at year-end 2022. \n\n**_Non-Interest Expense_ **\n\nTotal non-interest expense was $10.680 million, down $593 thousand from non-interest expense of $11.273 million in the third quarter of 2023. Salaries and benefits expense was down $201 thousand on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to lower incentive accruals for lower than target performance results for the year. There was a planned decrease in marketing and public relations expenses of $438 thousand in the fourth quarter related to fewer media placements in the last three months of the year. FDIC insurance assessment expense was up $79 thousand on a linked quarter. \n\n**_About First Community Corporation_ **\n\nFirst Community Corporation stock trades on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \"FCCO\" and is the holding company for First Community Bank, a local community bank based in the Midlands of South Carolina.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors, include, among others, the following: (1) competitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly and have an effect on pricing, spending, third-party relationships and revenues; (2) the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations may be different than expected; (3) the rate of delinquencies and amounts of charge-offs, the level of allowance for loan loss, the rates of loan growth, or adverse changes in asset quality in our loan portfolio, which may result in increased credit risk-related losses and expenses; (4) changes in legislation, regulation, policies or administrative practices, whether by judicial, governmental, or legislative action; (5) adverse conditions in the stock market, the public debt markets and other capital markets (including changes in interest rate conditions) could continue to have a negative impact on the company; (6) changes in interest rates, which have and may continue to affect our deposit and funding costs, net income, prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, and other future cash flows, or the market value of our assets, including our investment securities; (7) technology and cybersecurity risks, including potential business disruptions, reputational risks, and financial losses, associated with potential attacks on or failures by our computer systems and computer systems of our vendors and other third parties; (8) elevated inflation which causes adverse risk to the overall economy, and could indirectly pose challenges to our customers and to our business; (9) FDIC assessment which has increased and may continue to impact our cost of doing business; (10) the adverse effects of events beyond our control that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and the economy, such as epidemics and pandemics, war or terrorist activities, essential utility outages, deterioration in the global economy, instability in the credit markets, disruptions in our customers' supply chains or disruption in transportation; and (11) risks, uncertainties and other factors disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, or in any of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC since the end of the fiscal year covered by our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are available at the SEC's Internet site (<http://www.sec.gov>).\n\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove to be inaccurate.

Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=CH19478&sd=2024-01-24) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-community-corporation-announces-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2023-results-and-cash-dividend-302042888.html>\n\nSOURCE First Community Corporation\n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n![First Community Logo Mark](//s26.q4cdn.com/899478308/files/images/irw/logo-mark.svg)\n\n## Direct Access to Real People\n\n### Talk to Us\n\n800.829.6372\n\n### Visit Us\n\n[Locations](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Locations)\n\n### Connect with Us\n\n[Contact](https://www.firstcommunitysc.com/Contact)\n"
