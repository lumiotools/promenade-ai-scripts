(NASDAQ: AXDX), an innovator of rapid _in vitro_ diagnostics, announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 510(k) clearance of the Accelerate Arc system and BC kit, an innovative, automated positive blood culture sample preparation platform, for use with Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper® CA System (MBT-CA System) and MBT-CA Sepsityper® software extension.\n\nDesigned for clinical laboratories, the Accelerate Arc system has a simple workflow that automates positive blood culture sample preparation for direct downstream microbial identification (ID) using Bruker’s MBT-CA system. This eliminates the need for overnight culture methods, reducing the wait time for microbial ID results, which is critical in the fight against sepsis.\n\nThe Accelerate Arc system is designed to leverage the breadth of the Bruker MBT-CA reference library to provide rapid ID. This, in conjunction with our future rapid phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) innovation, the Accelerate _WAVE_ ™ system 1, can enable same shift reporting to Antimicrobial Stewardship teams and clinicians alike. By providing clinicians with rapid ID and AST results, clinicians can get the patient on the optimal antibiotic therapy many hours sooner, which has been shown to improve patient outcomes with Sepsis, reduce antimicrobial resistance rates and hospital costs.\n\nThe Accelerate Arc system is also designed to supplant both overnight subculture as well as laborious Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) sample preparation methods. Clinical laboratories are under pressure to run FDA-cleared devices due to increased legislation and enforcement associated with the use of LDTs. Accordingly, such laboratories can now utilize the Accelerate Arc system as an automated, FDA-cleared system.\n\n“The FDA Clearance of the Accelerate Arc system marks the beginning of an exciting journey in our broader innovation roadmap. Together with the Accelerate _WAVE_ ™ system 1 we are positioned to empower laboratories to deliver faster, more actionable results to clinicians, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.” said Jack Phillips, President and CEO of Accelerate Diagnostics.\n\n1 The Accelerate WAVETM system is currently in clinical trials in preparation for FDA 510(k) submission with a target time-to-result of 4.5-hours, on average.\n\n**About Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXDX)**\n\nAccelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an  _in vitro_ diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions for the global challenges of antibiotic resistance and sepsis. In addition to the Accelerate Arc system, the Accelerate Pheno system and Accelerate PhenoTest® BC kit combine several technologies aimed at reducing the time clinicians must wait to determine the most optimal antibiotic therapy for deadly infections. The FDA-cleared Accelerate Pheno system and Accelerate PhenoTest BC kit fully automate sample preparation, identification and phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility testing in approximately seven hours directly from positive blood cultures. Recent external studies indicate the solution offers results 1–2 days faster than existing methods, enabling clinicians to optimize antibiotic selection and dosage specific to the individual patient days earlier.\n\n© Copyright 2024 Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.

(NASDAQ: AXDX) an innovator of rapid _in vitro_ diagnostics in microbiology, announced the successful completion of its WAVE pre-clinical trial. The Accelerate WAVE system is designed to deliver rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing (“AST”) directly from positive blood culture (“PBC”) bottles and bacterial isolated colonies (“Isolates”) to report accurate results within 4.5 hours, on average.\n\nIt is estimated by the World Health Organization, Sepsis affects an estimated 49 million1 people globally each year, causing an estimated 11 million1 deaths of which an estimated 1.32 million are attributed to bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, Sepsis is the number one cost to the US healthcare system with an annual estimated expense of $62 billion3. By delivering rapid AST results, patients with serious infections can be put on targeted antimicrobial therapy to improve patient outcomes, cut hospital costs, and reduce antimicrobial resistance.\n\n“We are extremely pleased to announce the goals for our WAVE pre-clinical trial were achieved with strong performance and unprecedented time-to-result of 4.5-hours, on average, along with strong instrument reliability and assay reportability,” commented Jack Phillips, President and CEO of Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. “With the success of the pre-clinical trial we have confidence in both our WAVE product design and the system capabilities to move to a clinical trial and in turn commercialize.” Mr. Phillips continued.\n\nThe pre-clinical trial included 1,570 WAVE results compared to Broth Microdilution (“BMD”), the reference method. The trial included an equal number of prospective patient samples and site selected challenge samples which resulted in excellent concordance between sample types. Summary performance concluded overall Essential Agreement (“EA”) and Categorical Agreement (“CA”) of approximately 95%.

(NASDAQ: AXDX) an innovator of rapid _in vitro_ diagnostics in microbiology, announced its 510(k) submission to the US FDA of its Accelerate Arc™ system and BC kit, an innovative, automated positive blood culture sample preparation platform, for use with Bruker’s MALDI Biotyper® CA (MBT-CA) System and MBT-CA Sepsityper® software extension.\n\nDesigned for clinical laboratories, the Accelerate Arc™ system has a simple load-and-go workflow that automates direct from positive blood culture sample preparation for downstream microbial identification using Bruker’s MBT-CA system in about 1 ½ hours. The Accelerate Arc™ system enables on-demand processing of critical samples without the need for an overnight culture incubation, reducing the wait time for identification results. It was designed for labs to be able to leverage the breadth of the Bruker MBT-CA reference library in combination with rapid phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility results from the Accelerate WAVE™ system which is currently under development and planned for future release.\n\nThe Accelerate Arc™ system is designed to compete with molecular positive blood culture identification solutions. Namely, utilization of Bruker’s MBT-CA System, in conjunction with the Accelerate Arc™ system, offers the potential to reduce the likelihood of cross reactivity and false positive results that can come with rapid molecular tests. In addition, the platform economics are more favorable with the Accelerate Arc™ system as compared to on-market molecular platforms, especially when laboratories consider that approximately 30% of results are blood culture contaminants resulting in wasted expense. Finally, clinical laboratories are under pressure to run FDA cleared devices with increased legislation and enforcement of laboratory developed tests. As such, Accelerate has completed its clinical trials and submitted to the FDA.\n\n“The total cost to rapidly identify organisms from positive blood cultures is significantly lower than what labs are paying today for a rapid molecular ID solution,” said Jack Phillips, President and CEO of Accelerate Diagnostics. “When you think of the extreme demand that labs are under today, the Arc™ system is a fast and inexpensive diagnostic tool which frees up technician hands and lab budgets to deliver actionable results in the race against sepsis.”\n\n**About Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. (Nasdaq: AXDX)**\n\nAccelerate Diagnostics, Inc. is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions for the global challenges of antibiotic resistance and sepsis. In addition to its Arc™ system, the Accelerate Pheno® system and Accelerate PhenoTest® BC kit combine several technologies aimed at reducing the time clinicians must wait to determine the most optimal antibiotic therapy for deadly infections. The FDA cleared Accelerate Pheno® system and kit fully automate the sample preparation steps to report phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility results in approximately 7 hours direct from positive blood cultures. Recent external studies indicate the solution offers results 1–2 days faster than existing methods, enabling clinicians to optimize antibiotic selection and dosage specific to the individual patient days earlier.\n\n© Copyright 2024 Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.
