(“Cricut”) (NASDAQ: CRCT), the creative technology company that has brought a connected platform for making to millions of users worldwide, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are pleased with the increase in paid subscribers in Q3 up 5% YoY to over 2.8 million, which exceeded our expectations. To benefit all members, we continued during the quarter to make improvements to our software platform, specifically in helping them search and find inspiring content on our platform and removing friction in designing their projects in Design Space,\" said Ashish Arora, Chief Executive Officer of Cricut. \"Evidence that these efforts are having a positive impact is that this is the second consecutive quarter of a YoY increase in the share of members who complete a project during their first day and who complete multiple projects in their first week.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $167.9 million, down 4% from Q3 2023.\n  * Platform revenue was $77.7 million, slightly up over Q3 2023.\n  * Products revenue was $90.2 million, down 7% from Q3 2023.\n  * International revenue increased by 2% over Q3 2023 and was 23% of total revenue, up from 21% of total revenue in Q3 2023.\n  * Gross margin was 46.1%, down from 46.8% in Q3 2023.\n  * Operating income was $10.6 million, or 6.3% of total revenue compared to $23.7 million, or 13.5% of revenue in Q3 2023.\n  * Net income was $11.5 million, or 6.8% of revenue, and down 33% from Q3 2023. Net income in Q3 2023 was $17.2 million, or 9.8% of revenue.\n  * Diluted earnings per share was $0.05, down from $0.08 per share in Q3 2023.\n  * Generated $70 million in Cash from Operations in Q3. Used $10.3 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock in Q3.\n\n\n\n“We remain profitable and continue to expect incremental operating margin improvement for the full year even as we continue to manage the business for the long term. In Q3 2024, we generated $70 million in cash from operations, ended the quarter with $247 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we remain debt free. During Q3, we used $10.3 million of cash to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our stock, resulting in $30.8 million remaining on our $50 million authorized stock repurchase program. In July, we paid approximately $108 million in dividends for the special one-time dividend of $0.40 per share, plus our first recurring semi-annual dividend of $0.10 per share,\" said Kimball Shill, Chief Financial Officer of Cricut. \"We are pleased to announce The Board of Directors authorized our second recurring semi-annual dividend of $0.10 per share for shareholders of record on January 7, 2025, payable on January 21, 2025. We remain committed to our long-term operating margin targets of 15-19%. Our proven model has demonstrated that when we operate at scale and drive top line growth, these margins are achievable.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Paid Subscribers increased to over 2.8 million, up 5% year over year.\n  * Platform ARPU increased to $52.86, up 3% year over year.\n  * Active Users decreased slightly year over year to nearly 5.9 million.\n  * 90-Day Engaged Users decreased 3% year over year to over 3.5 million.\n\n\n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**As of September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nActive Users (in thousands)| 5,894| 5,929  \n90-Day Engaged Users (in thousands)| 3,532| 3,641  \nPaid Subscribers (in thousands)| 2,838| 2,699  \n  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nPlatform ARPU| $| 52.86| $| 51.20  \n  \n**Glossary of Terms**\n\n**_Active Users_**\n\nWe define Active Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 365 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total Active Users and the prior owner is removed from the total Active Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. Active Users is a key indicator of the health of our business, because changes in the number of Active Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue.\n\n**_90-Day Engaged Users_**\n\nWe define 90-Day Engaged Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 90 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total 90-Day Engaged Users and the prior owner is removed from the total 90-Day Engaged Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. 90-Day Engaged Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue.\n\n**_Paid Subscribers_**\n\nWe define Paid Subscribers as the number of users with a subscription to Cricut Access or Cricut Access Premium, excluding cancelled, unpaid or free trial subscriptions, as of the end of a period. Paid Subscribers is a key metric to track growth in our Platform revenue and potential leverage in our gross margin.\n\n**_Platform ARPU_**\n\nWe define Platform ARPU as Platform in a 12-month period revenue divided by Active Users. Platform ARPU allows us to forecast Platform revenue over time and is an indicator of our ability to expand with users and of user engagement with our subscription offerings.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nCricut management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results today, Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning future actions, conditions or events, future results of operations or the ability to generate revenues, income or cash flow are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on and reflect our current expectations, estimates, assumptions and/ or projections and our perception of historical trends and current conditions, as well as other factors that we believe are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances. Forward-looking statements are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events, circumstances or performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements.

(“Cricut”) (NASDAQ: CRCT), the creative technology company that has brought a connected platform for making to millions of users worldwide, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"We are pleased with the increase in paid subscribers in Q3 up 5% YoY to over 2.8 million, which exceeded our expectations. To benefit all members, we continued during the quarter to make improvements to our software platform, specifically in helping them search and find inspiring content on our platform and removing friction in designing their projects in Design Space,\" said Ashish Arora, Chief Executive Officer of Cricut. \"Evidence that these efforts are having a positive impact is that this is the second consecutive quarter of a YoY increase in the share of members who complete a project during their first day and who complete multiple projects in their first week.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Revenue was $167.9 million, down 4% from Q3 2023.\n  * Platform revenue was $77.7 million, slightly up over Q3 2023.\n  * Products revenue was $90.2 million, down 7% from Q3 2023.\n  * International revenue increased by 2% over Q3 2023 and was 23% of total revenue, up from 21% of total revenue in Q3 2023.\n  * Gross margin was 46.1%, down from 46.8% in Q3 2023.\n  * Operating income was $10.6 million, or 6.3% of total revenue compared to $23.7 million, or 13.5% of revenue in Q3 2023.\n  * Net income was $11.5 million, or 6.8% of revenue, and down 33% from Q3 2023. Net income in Q3 2023 was $17.2 million, or 9.8% of revenue.\n  * Diluted earnings per share was $0.05, down from $0.08 per share in Q3 2023.\n  * Generated $70 million in Cash from Operations in Q3. Used $10.3 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock in Q3.\n\n\n\n“We remain profitable and continue to expect incremental operating margin improvement for the full year even as we continue to manage the business for the long term. In Q3 2024, we generated $70 million in cash from operations, ended the quarter with $247 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we remain debt free. During Q3, we used $10.3 million of cash to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our stock, resulting in $30.8 million remaining on our $50 million authorized stock repurchase program. In July, we paid approximately $108 million in dividends for the special one-time dividend of $0.40 per share, plus our first recurring semi-annual dividend of $0.10 per share,\" said Kimball Shill, Chief Financial Officer of Cricut. \"We are pleased to announce The Board of Directors authorized our second recurring semi-annual dividend of $0.10 per share for shareholders of record on January 7, 2025, payable on January 21, 2025. We remain committed to our long-term operating margin targets of 15-19%. Our proven model has demonstrated that when we operate at scale and drive top line growth, these margins are achievable.”\n\n**Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Paid Subscribers increased to over 2.8 million, up 5% year over year.\n  * Platform ARPU increased to $52.86, up 3% year over year.\n  * Active Users decreased slightly year over year to nearly 5.9 million.\n  * 90-Day Engaged Users decreased 3% year over year to over 3.5 million.\n\n\n\n**Key Performance Metrics**\n\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. We believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the long-term health of our business. Our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies. The presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**As of September 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nActive Users (in thousands)| 5,894| 5,929  \n90-Day Engaged Users (in thousands)| 3,532| 3,641  \nPaid Subscribers (in thousands)| 2,838| 2,699  \n  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nPlatform ARPU| $| 52.86| $| 51.20  \n  \n**Glossary of Terms**\n\n**_Active Users_**\n\nWe define Active Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 365 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total Active Users and the prior owner is removed from the total Active Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. Active Users is a key indicator of the health of our business, because changes in the number of Active Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue.\n\n**_90-Day Engaged Users_**\n\nWe define 90-Day Engaged Users as registered users of at least one registered connected machine who have utilized their connected machine to create a project in the last 90 days. One user may own multiple registered connected machines but is only counted once if that user registers those connected machines by using the same email address. If possession of a connected machine is transferred to a new owner and registered by that new owner, the new owner is added to the total 90-Day Engaged Users and the prior owner is removed from the total 90-Day Engaged Users if the prior owner does not own any other registered connected machines. 90-Day Engaged Users excludes non-users to better represent opportunities for us to drive additional platform and accessories and materials revenue.\n\n**_Paid Subscribers_**\n\nWe define Paid Subscribers as the number of users with a subscription to Cricut Access or Cricut Access Premium, excluding cancelled, unpaid or free trial subscriptions, as of the end of a period. Paid Subscribers is a key metric to track growth in our Platform revenue and potential leverage in our gross margin.\n\n**_Platform ARPU_**\n\nWe define Platform ARPU as Platform in a 12-month period revenue divided by Active Users. Platform ARPU allows us to forecast Platform revenue over time and is an indicator of our ability to expand with users and of user engagement with our subscription offerings.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information**\n\nCricut management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results today, Tuesday, November 5, 2024 at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

Forward-looking statements are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events, circumstances or performance and are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by those statements. There can be no assurance that our expectations, estimates, assumptions and/or projections will prove to be correct or that any of our expectations, estimates or projections will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included in this press release are only made as of the date indicated on the relevant materials and are based on our estimates and opinions at the time the statements are made. We disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or changes in opinion, except as required by law.\n\nNumerous factors could cause our actual results and events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties associated with: our ability to attract and engage with our users; competitive risks; supply chain, manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment risks; international risks, including regulation and tariffs that have materially increased our costs and the potential for further trade barriers or disruptions; sales and marketing risks, including our dependence on sales to brick-and-mortar and online retail partners and our need to continue to grow online sales; risks relating to the complexity of our business, which includes connected machines, custom tools, hundreds of materials, design apps, e-commerce software, subscriptions, content, international production, direct sales and retail distribution; risks related to product quality, safety and warranty claims and returns; risks related to the fluctuation of our quarterly results of operations and other operating metrics; risks related to intellectual property, cybersecurity and potential data breaches; risks related to our dependence on our Chief Executive Officer; risks related to our status as a “controlled company”; and the impact of economic and geopolitical events, natural disasters and actual or threatened public health emergencies, current recessionary pressures and any resulting economic slowdown from any of these events, or other resulting interruption to our operations. These risks and uncertainties are described in greater detail, or are incorporated by reference, under the heading “Risk Factors” in the most recent form 10-Q that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\n\nIn addition, certain risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could affect the accuracy of any such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty. The forward-looking statements included in these materials are only made as of the date indicated on the relevant materials and we disclaim any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, except as required by law.\n\n**Cricut, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income****(unaudited)****_(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nRevenue:  \nPlatform| $| 77,674| $| 77,455| $| 233,609| $| 231,082  \nProducts| 90,216| 97,454| 269,620| 302,819  \nTotal revenue| 167,890| 174,909| 503,229| 533,901  \nCost of revenue:  \nPlatform| 10,000| 8,276| 27,647| 24,045  \nProducts| 80,527| 84,699| 216,785| 263,601  \nTotal cost of revenue| 90,527| 92,975| 244,432| 287,646  \nGross profit| 77,363| 81,934| 258,797| 246,255  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 15,240| 15,910| 44,408| 50,057  \nSales and marketing| 35,278| 28,375| 101,662| 87,398  \nGeneral and administrative| 16,249| 13,962| 50,494| 55,334  \nTotal operating expenses| 66,767| 58,247| 196,564| 192,789  \nIncome from operations| 10,596| 23,687| 62,233| 53,466  \nOther income (expense):  \nInterest income| 2,718| 1,340| 8,189| 6,211  \nInterest expense| (84| )| (81| )| (245| )| (240| )  \nOther income| 932| 569| 2,067| 1,863  \nTotal other income, net| 3,566| 1,828| 10,011| 7,834  \nIncome before provision for income taxes| 14,162| 25,515| 72,244| 61,300  \nProvision for income taxes| 2,674| 8,290| 21,340| 18,952  \nNet income| $| 11,488| $| 17,225| $| 50,904| $| 42,348  \nOther comprehensive income:  \nChange in net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net of tax| $| 46| $| 76| $| —| $| (54| )  \nChange in foreign currency translation adjustment, net of tax| 229| (56| )| 140| (88| )  \nComprehensive income| $| 11,763| $| 17,245| $| 51,044| $| 42,206  \nEarnings per share, basic| $| 0.05| $| 0.08| $| 0.24| $| 0.20  \nEarnings per share, diluted| $| 0.05| $| 0.08| $| 0.24| $| 0.19  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, basic| 214,769,065| 217,737,089| 214,706,773| 216,771,051  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding, diluted| 215,749,745| 220,424,691| 215,281,337| 219,920,343  \n  \n**Cricut, Inc.****Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets**** _(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)_**  \n---  \n**As of September 30,2024**| **As of December 31,2023**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 142,376| $| 142,187  \nMarketable securities| 104,566| 102,952  \nAccounts receivable, net| 93,302| 111,247  \nInventories| 167,503| 244,469  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets| 33,010| 19,114  \nTotal current assets| 540,757| 619,969  \nProperty and equipment, net| 39,792| 47,614  \nOperating lease right-of-use asset| 9,047| 12,353  \nDeferred tax assets| 46,839| 34,823  \nOther assets| 27,330| 35,363  \nTotal assets| $| 663,765| $| 750,122  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable| $| 45,524| $| 76,860  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities| 77,437| 71,933  \nDeferred revenue, current portion| 43,376| 40,304  \nOperating lease liabilities, current portion| 4,595| 5,230  \nDividends payable, current portion| 379| 2,137  \nTotal current liabilities| 171,311| 196,464  \nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion| 5,864| 8,938  \nDeferred revenue, net of current portion| 2,530| 2,931  \nOther non-current liabilities| 8,224| 6,916  \nTotal liabilities| 187,929| 215,249  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nStockholders’ equity:  \nPreferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100,000,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.| —| —  \nCommon stock, par value $0.001 per share, 1,250,000,000 shares authorized as of September 30, 2024, 214,422,477 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2024;
