The increase was mainly due to more revenues from IT solutions during the quarter, partially offset by the Company's cost control initiatives and efficiency improvements.\n  * **General and administrative expenses** were RMB176.6 million (US$25.2 million), compared with RMB214.5 million in the same quarter of last year.

The operating margin was negative 5.6%, an improvement from negative 7.4% in the same quarter of last year.\n\n**Non-GAAP loss from operations** was RMB85.2 million (US$12.1 million), an improvement from RMB90.4 million in the same quarter of last year.

An archived webcast will be available through the same link following the call.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its business. For example, the Company uses non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, as supplemental measures to review and assess its financial and operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as income (loss) from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, and cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs. The Company defines non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as a percentage of total net revenues. The Company defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and investment in equity investee, and unrealized investment loss. The Company defines non-GAAP net margin as non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of total net revenues. The Company defines non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. as net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and investment in equity investee, and unrealized investment loss. The Company defines diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS as non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. divided by weighted average number of shares used in calculating net income (loss) per ordinary share multiplied by three.\n\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the Company's management to evaluate the Company's financial and operating performance and formulate business plans. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS reflect the Company's ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the Company's current operating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so choose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and other items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in nature or may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc., and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company's operations. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their financial results to the Company's. In light of the foregoing limitations, the non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS for the period should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to income (loss) from operations, operating margin, net income (loss), net margin, net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The company encourages you to review the company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, \"Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.\"\n\n**Safe Harbor Statements**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

An archived webcast will be available through the\nsame link following the call.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its business. For\nexample, the Company uses non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating\nmargin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income (loss)\nattributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss)\nattributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, as supplemental measures to\nreview and assess its financial and operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial\ninformation prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as income (loss) from\noperations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of\nintangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment\nof goodwill, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, and cancellation\nfees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs. The Company defines non-GAAP operating\nmargin as non-GAAP income (loss) from operations as a percentage of total net revenues. The\nCompany defines non-GAAP net income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding the impact of\nshare-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business\nacquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, loss on\nvariance from expected contingent acquisition payment, cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs\nand returned ADSs, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and\ninvestment in equity investee, and unrealized investment loss. The Company defines non-GAAP\nnet margin as non-GAAP net income (loss) as a percentage of total net revenues. The Company\ndefines non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. as net\nincome (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. excluding the impact of share-\nbased compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business\nacquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, loss on\nvariance from expected contingent acquisition payment, cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs\nand returned ADSs, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and\ninvestment in equity investee, and unrealized investment loss. The Company defines diluted non-\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS as non-\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. divided by\nweighted average number of shares used in calculating net income (loss) per ordinary share\nmultiplied by three.\nThe Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the\nCompany’s management to evaluate the Company’s financial and operating performance and\nformulate business plans. Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP net income\n(loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and\ndiluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per\nADS reflect the Company’s ongoing business operations in a manner that allows more\nmeaningful period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that the use of the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures facilitates investors to understand and evaluate the Company’s current\noperating performance and future prospects in the same manner as management does, if they so\nchoose. The Company also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful\ninformation to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gain/loss and\nother items that are not expected to result in future cash payments or that are non-recurring in\nnature or may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical\ntools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP\nnet income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun\nInc., and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun\nInc. per ADS is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s\noperations. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by\nother companies, including peer companies, potentially limiting the comparability of their\nfinancial results to the Company’s. In light of the foregoing limitations, the non-GAAP income\n(loss) from operations, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP\nnet margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun\nInc. and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun\nInc. per ADS for the period should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to\nincome (loss) from operations, operating margin, net income (loss), net margin, net income (loss)\nattributable to ordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to\nordinary shareholders of Baozun Inc. per ADS, or other financial measures prepared in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, which should be considered when\nevaluating the Company’s performance. The company encourages you to review the company’s\nfinancial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. For reconciliations\nof these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial\nmeasures, please see the section of the accompanying tables titled, “Reconciliations of GAAP\nand Non-GAAP Results.”\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

These statements are\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended and the U.S Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates and information available to the Company, as of the date of this presentation, and are\nnot guarantees of future performance. These forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions which are subject to known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control, such as the political, social, legal and economic environment in which the Company will operate in\nthe future. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the\nCompany’s filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and its announcements, notices or other documents published on the website of The Stock\nExchange of Hong Kong Limited.

Please see the Company’s various other public disclosure documents for a detailed\ndiscussion of those risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company uses certain financial measures that are not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) in evaluating its business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items\nof income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including\npeer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The use of such non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measures, see “Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures”.\n1\n3Q24 Financial Highlights\nNon-GAAP Non-GAAP YTD Share\nRevenue\nOperating Income (1) Net Income (2) repurchase\nRMB 2.1 bn RMB (85) mn RMB (70) mn US$9.9 mn\nYoY +13% YoY +6% YoY +10%\n(1) Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as income from operations excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses,\nimpairment of goodwill, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, and cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs.\n(2) Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets resulting from business acquisition, acquisition-related expenses, impairment of goodwill and\ninvestments, loss on variance from expected contingent acquisition payment, cancellation fees of repurchased ADSs and returned ADSs, fair value loss on derivative liabilities, loss on disposal of subsidiaries and investment in equity investee, and unrealized investment loss.\n2\nNet Revenues Breakdown\nTotal E-Commerce Brand Management\nNet Revenues Net Revenues Net Revenues\nRMB 2.1 bn YoY +13% RMB 1.8 bn YoY +14% RMB 331 mn(1) YoY +10%\nProduct Sales Services\nProduct Sales – Product Sales – Services – Services – Services -
