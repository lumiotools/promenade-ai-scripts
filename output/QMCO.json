DXi9000 Series for Greater Cyber Resilience Across the Edge, the Core, and the Cloud\") November 20, 2024 8:00am EST \n\n_New DXi9200 hybrid backup appliance solution achieves new levels of efficiency in helping customers prepare, protect and quickly recover from cyberattacks_\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ: QMCO), the pioneer in end-to-end data management solutions designed for the AI era, today announces the [DXi9200](https://www.quantum.com/en/products/backup-appliances?utm_source=datacenter_dynamics&utm_medium=online_media), the latest generation of its highly successful, flagship DXi9000 Series hybrid (flash + dense disk) data protection appliances, designed for scalable, efficient backup and recovery services for large organizations. With the continuing threat of ransomware attacks, organizations need to take a comprehensive and proactive approach to secure their data and data copies, continuously validate recovery operations, and quickly recover in case of attack. As the industry’s most scalable, feature-rich, and efficient data protection appliance, the DXi9200 meets these challenges head on. \n\n“The DXi9200 is a powerful new solution for strengthening any organization’s cyber resilience,” says Sanam Mittal, Vice President, DXi. “Coupled with highly optimized data reduction, replication, and cloud tiering, plus all-inclusive software, capacity-on-demand licensing, and Flexible as-a-Service subscription service options, the DXi9200 dramatically lowers costs and increases IT efficiency. DXi9200 is the ideal choice for enterprise backup and recovery services, consolidation of offsite immutable copies for disaster recovery and long-term retention, and as the central hub of modern edge-core-cloud data protection fabrics.” \n\n**Flexible scalability.** The DXi9000 Series is well recognized for its flexible deployment options, providing small capacity entry points with the ability to expand with capacity-on-demand licensing and incremental upgrades as needs grow, up to 20 times initial capacity. The solution features a 110 TB entry capacity that can easily scale in 55 TB increments up to 2.2 PB usable. Plus, with up to 70x data reduction rates and bundled DXi Cloud Share tiering to public and private clouds, the DXi9200 achieves logical capacities of up to 462 PBs under management to ensure that organizations can stay cyber resilient as their data volumes grow. \n\n**Security-rich feature set.** The DXi9200 strengthens every customer’s cyber resilience to protect against cyberattacks with a hardened architecture consistent with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 (CSF 2.0) designed to help organizations to manage and reduce their cybersecurity risks. The DXi9200 features: \n\n  * Protection against unauthorized access with secure connectivity to backup software, replication partners, and cloud tiering destinations based on at-rest and in-flight data encryption, secure multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. \n  * Offsite protection of data copies through bundled replication, cloud tiering to public and private clouds, cooperating DXi virtual and physical appliances, and Direct-to-Tape capabilities, for seamless disaster recovery within minutes. \n  * More than 30% faster ingest and restore performance* for increasing service levels including more frequent backups, continuous validation of data sets and recovery processes, and instant data access for rapid recovery of large, critical workflows, to minimize downtime after an incident and achieve better recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO). \n  * Extensive system monitoring and alerting capabilities including real-time status and anomaly detection of critical events or irregularities, helping prevent data breaches or system failures. \n  * Backup data integrity against alteration, deletion or corruption with offline immutable snapshot data copies, frequent native data integrity health checks, parity-protected RAID, and a compatible ecosystem of data protection and malware scanning software, including Veeam, Veritas, and Commvault. \n\n\n\n**Density and efficiency.** With the advent of Quantum’s all-flash DXi T-Series appliances setting a new standard for ultra-fast ransomware recovery, the role of hybrid appliances is quickly evolving to key use cases where cost efficiency is a primary concern. By integrating both fast NVME flash and dense hard disks, the DXi9200 doubles price/performance compared to prior generations, achieving up to 68% denser packaging (2.2 PB usable in only 12 rack units), and 25% less power consumption, enabling organizations to aggressively improve the cyber resilience of their infrastructure at a reasonable cost. \n\nDXi9200 appliances are available immediately. All DXi products are flexibly available as a capital purchase or via Quantum GO, Quantum’s pay-as-you-go subscription offering. \n\nFor more information, visit: [https://www.quantum.com/dxi](https://www.quantum.com/en/products/backup-appliances?utm_source=datacenter_dynamics&utm_medium=online_media). \n\n_*Compared to the DXi9100_\n\n**About Quantum**\n\nQuantum delivers end-to-end data management solutions designed for the AI era.

Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quantum Corporation (Nasdaq: QMCO) (\"Quantum\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in solutions for AI and unstructured data, announced today financial results for its fiscal second quarter 2025 ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\n  * Revenue was $70.5 million \n  * GAAP gross profit was $29.3 million, or 41.5% of revenue \n  * GAAP net loss was $13.5 million, or ($2.82) per share \n  * Subscription ARR was up 28% year-over-year at $19.6 million \n  * Adjusted non-GAAP net loss was $8.7 million, or ($1.82) per share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was approximately breakeven \n\n\n\n“Sales bookings and customer win rates for the quarter were consistent with our overall business expectations as we continued to transform the company,” stated Jamie Lerner, Chairman and CEO of Quantum. “However, operational headwinds with the supply chain continued this quarter, resulting in exiting the quarter with higher than anticipated backlog. Evidence of our transformation can be seen in the progress of gross margin improving 490 basis points sequentially to above 41%, as well as non-GAAP operating expenses being reduced by more than 8% year-over-year. These actions contributed to our achievement of breakeven adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. \n\n“Our business strategy remains focused on high-priority growth initiatives, particularly around Myriad and ActiveScale as we are seeing demonstrated proof points of our ability to significantly expand within our target verticals. In FQ2'25, we achieved significant pipeline growth for Myriad and ActiveScale. An existing Quantum customer who was looking for a comprehensive solution with high-speed primary storage and a secure, cost-efficient, long-term storage solution purchased our Myriad and ActiveScale Cold Storage products, as a Quantum Go subscription. Additionally, as we maintain a strong base with our data protection offerings, Quantum’s recently launched DXi T-Series is the only solution in the market offering robust cyber-resilient features in a 1U, all-flash data protection appliance. We’ve had multiple strategic wins against the competition based on the DXi T-Series fast recovery times in the face of a cyberattack due to its leading data reduction and recovery rates. This is a testament to our continued investment in innovation and our laser focus on allowing our customers to recognize the value in their data. \n\n“While our efforts are still short of the intended results, we are seeing positive proof points through our new product introductions, including Myriad traction, combined with driving a more operationally efficient business.” \n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 vs. Prior Year Quarter**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2025 was $70.5 million, compared to $75.7 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, largely reflecting lower revenue contribution from primary storage. GAAP gross profit in the second quarter of 2025 was $29.3 million, or 41.5% of revenue, compared to $32.7 million, or 43.3% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year quarter. \n\nTotal GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal second quarter of 2025 were $36.2 million, or 51.4% of revenue, compared to $36.4 million, or 48.1% of revenue, in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.6 million, compared to $25.9 million in the prior fiscal year primarily driven by increased non-recurring new ERP systems spend along with accounting and tax work. Research and development expenses in the fiscal second quarter of 2025 were $8.3 million, compared to $9.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $30.4 million, compared to $33.3 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. \n\nGAAP net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $13.5 million, or ($2.82) per share, which included a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.3 million and negative $1.2 million non-cash intercompany foreign currency adjustment, and compared to a GAAP net loss of $3.3 million, or ($0.70) per share in the prior fiscal year quarter. Excluding the income statement impact of the warrants, stock compensation, restructuring charges, and other non-recurring costs, non-GAAP adjusted net loss in the quarter was $8.7 million, or ($1.82) per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.4 million, or ($0.93) per share in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA in fiscal second quarter 2025 was essentially breakeven at ($0.3) million, compared to $1.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and a $3.0 million improvement sequentially. \n\nFor a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, please see the financial reconciliation tables below. \n\n**Liquidity and Debt (as of September 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $17.0 million, compared to $25.8 million as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Total interest expense for the second quarter was $6.1 million, compared to $3.9 million for the same period a year ago. \n  * Outstanding term loan debt, excluding debt issuance costs, was $104.7 million, compared to $87.9 million as of September 30, 2023. Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility was $28.3 million, compared to $21.5 million as of September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter of 2025, the Company expects the following guidance: \n\n  * Revenues of $72.0 million, plus or minus $2.0 million \n  * Non-GAAP adjusted basic net loss per share of ($0.75), plus or minus $0.05 \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.0 million \n\n\n\nThis assumes an effective annual tax rate of negative 3%; non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share assumes an average basic share count of approximately 4.8 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a live conference call today, November 13, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss these results.

Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net loss before restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, loss on debt extinguishment, non-recurring project costs, including restatement and debt-related matters and fair value of warrants adjustments. We calculate adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share using the above-referenced definition of adjusted net income (loss). \n\nWe have provided below reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operational expenses, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operating plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business performance. For example, in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we have excluded a large inventory reserve provision caused by global supply chain disruptions since the start of the pandemic and the longer associated lead times that resulted in older generation products being displaced by next-generation solutions. We do not believe an inventory adjustment of this magnitude is reasonably likely to reoccur in the foreseeable future and do not believe it is indicative of our ongoing operations; accordingly, we have excluded its impact from our non-GAAP results. We believe adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business and help our investors better compare our operating performance over multiple periods. Accordingly, we believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors. \n\nOur use of non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: \n\n  * Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) interest and tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; (2) capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (3) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (4) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation expense; (5) potential future costs related to our long-term debt; (6) potential future restructuring expenses; (7) potential future costs related to business acquisitions; (8) gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, (9) and acquisition-related amortization of intangibles assets from business combinations, or (10) fair market adjustments related to the Company’s warrants. \n  * Adjusted net income (loss) does not reflect: (1) potential future restructuring activities; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation expense; (3) potential future costs related to our long-term debt; (4) potential future costs related to business acquisitions; (5) gain (loss) on debt extinguishment; (6) acquisition-related amortization of intangibles assets from business combinations; or (7) fair market adjustments related to the Company’s warrants. \n\n\n\nOther companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) along with other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics and our U.S. GAAP financial results. \n\nIn addition, this press release includes forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted earnings or net loss per share and adjusted EBITDA, each a non-GAAP measure used to describe our expected performance.

JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- [Quantum Corporation](http://www.quantum.com/) (NASDAQ: QMCO), the pioneer in end-to-end data management solutions designed for the AI era, today announced its [ActiveScale](https://www.quantum.com/en/products/object-storage?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=veeam)® object storage software has extended its [Veeam® Ready](https://www.quantum.com/en/solutions/enterprise-backup-and-archive/veeam?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=veeam) qualifications. [Veeam](https://www.veeam.com/?ad=in-text-link)® Software is the #1 leader by market share in Data Resilience. Quantum’s new Veeam Ready qualifications now include the new ActiveScale 7.0 software that includes support for all-flash solutions for fast ransomware recovery and ActiveScale Cold Storage support of Veeam Archive Tier for low-cost, air-gapped retention of Veeam backups. These Veeam Ready solutions provide organizations unprecedented cyber resilience with multi-layered protection, high performance, simplicity, and efficiency to prepare, protect, and recover business-critical applications rapidly and with confidence. \n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241001952539/en/>\n\n![Simply deploy a Veeam Scale-Out Backup Repository with ActiveScale with Cold Storage to achieve fast ingest, rapid recovery, and low-cost long-term retention. \\(Graphic: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241001952539/en/2258816/4/Veeam-AS-press_release_graphic.jpg)\n\nSimply deploy a Veeam Scale-Out Backup Repository with ActiveScale with Cold Storage to achieve fast ingest, rapid recovery, and low-cost long-term retention. (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nActiveScale object storage has long been recognized as a reliable Veeam Ready backup target, evolving alongside Veeam's expanding object storage capabilities. Designed for fast recovery across multiple storage classes using flash, hard disk, and tape, ActiveScale flexibly meets demanding recovery service level agreements (SLAs) and economically addresses long-term retention of backups. Recent advancements across the ActiveScale product portfolio strengthen its value within Veeam environments: \n\n  * The ActiveScale 7.0 release, which is now Veeam Ready, includes support for all-flash configurations offering impressive restore performance to provide rapid recovery of mission-critical data for fast response to ransomware attacks, rogue actors, and other data risks. Based on an all-flash, scale-out architecture, ActiveScale 7.0 seamlessly expands backup target resources (compute, networking and storage) for simple, scalable performance within a Veeam environment. \n  * The ActiveScale 7.0 Cold Storage feature is also now qualified as a Veeam Archive Tier, providing cost-effective access to all retained backups. Previous to Veeam Version 12.1, Archive Tiers were limited to public cloud storage services that are expensive to egress data, incur significant Internet and WAN costs, and are extremely slow. Restoring backups from ActiveScale Cold Storage is dramatically faster and up to 98% lower cost than public cloud offerings, extending the utility and value of the Veeam Archive Tier. Plus, with Veeam’s new Direct to Archive feature, backups can be sent directly from Performance Tier storage to the Archive Tier, further reducing overall costs and simplifying operations. \n\n\n\n“With ActiveScale, organizations can feel at ease that all their data is immutable against cyber threats and recoverable in minutes and hours instead of days or weeks,” says Bruno Hald, vice president, secondary storage, Quantum. “ActiveScale 7.0 provides fast restore performance now and in the future with easy scale-out expansion over time. ActiveScale 7.0 all-flash solutions are an ideal platform for deploying our ActiveScale Cold Storage feature to economically store Veeam Archive Tier backups for secure, immutable long-term retention.” \n\n\"The ongoing threat of ransomware attacks underscores the importance of cyber resilience as part of an overall Data Resilience strategy,\" said Andreas Neurfert, vice president of product management, alliances at Veeam. \"The combination of Veeam Data Platform™ and Quantum ActiveScale delivers a unique, cyber-resilient solution for fast recovery, economic long-term retention, and peace-of-mind data immutability.\" \n\nActiveScale 7.0 is Veeam Ready qualified and available from Quantum solution integrators and partners. Customers now have the flexibility of a capital purchase or [Quantum GO](https://www.quantum.com/en/products/services/staas?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=veeam), a newly released, pay-as-you-go subscription offering. \n\n[Click here](https://www.quantum.com/en/solutions/enterprise-backup-and-archive/veeam?utm_source=press_release&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=veeam) for more information on ActiveScale in a Veeam environment. \n\n**About Quantum**\n\nQuantum delivers end-to-end data management solutions designed for the AI era.

Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quantum Corporation (Nasdaq: QMCO) (\"Quantum\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in solutions for AI and unstructured data, announced today financial results for its fiscal second quarter 2025 ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 Financial Summary**\n\n  * Revenue was $70.5 million \n  * GAAP gross profit was $29.3 million, or 41.5% of revenue \n  * GAAP net loss was $13.5 million, or ($2.82) per share \n  * Subscription ARR was up 28% year-over-year at $19.6 million \n  * Adjusted non-GAAP net loss was $8.7 million, or ($1.82) per share \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was approximately breakeven \n\n\n\n“Sales bookings and customer win rates for the quarter were consistent with our overall business expectations as we continued to transform the company,” stated Jamie Lerner, Chairman and CEO of Quantum. “However, operational headwinds with the supply chain continued this quarter, resulting in exiting the quarter with higher than anticipated backlog. Evidence of our transformation can be seen in the progress of gross margin improving 490 basis points sequentially to above 41%, as well as non-GAAP operating expenses being reduced by more than 8% year-over-year. These actions contributed to our achievement of breakeven adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. \n\n“Our business strategy remains focused on high-priority growth initiatives, particularly around Myriad and ActiveScale as we are seeing demonstrated proof points of our ability to significantly expand within our target verticals. In FQ2'25, we achieved significant pipeline growth for Myriad and ActiveScale. An existing Quantum customer who was looking for a comprehensive solution with high-speed primary storage and a secure, cost-efficient, long-term storage solution purchased our Myriad and ActiveScale Cold Storage products, as a Quantum Go subscription. Additionally, as we maintain a strong base with our data protection offerings, Quantum’s recently launched DXi T-Series is the only solution in the market offering robust cyber-resilient features in a 1U, all-flash data protection appliance. We’ve had multiple strategic wins against the competition based on the DXi T-Series fast recovery times in the face of a cyberattack due to its leading data reduction and recovery rates. This is a testament to our continued investment in innovation and our laser focus on allowing our customers to recognize the value in their data. \n\n“While our efforts are still short of the intended results, we are seeing positive proof points through our new product introductions, including Myriad traction, combined with driving a more operationally efficient business.” \n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter 2025 vs. Prior Year Quarter**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2025 was $70.5 million, compared to $75.7 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, largely reflecting lower revenue contribution from primary storage. GAAP gross profit in the second quarter of 2025 was $29.3 million, or 41.5% of revenue, compared to $32.7 million, or 43.3% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year quarter. \n\nTotal GAAP operating expenses in the fiscal second quarter of 2025 were $36.2 million, or 51.4% of revenue, compared to $36.4 million, or 48.1% of revenue, in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $27.6 million, compared to $25.9 million in the prior fiscal year primarily driven by increased non-recurring new ERP systems spend along with accounting and tax work. Research and development expenses in the fiscal second quarter of 2025 were $8.3 million, compared to $9.2 million in the prior fiscal year quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $30.4 million, compared to $33.3 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. \n\nGAAP net loss in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $13.5 million, or ($2.82) per share, which included a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.3 million and negative $1.2 million non-cash intercompany foreign currency adjustment, and compared to a GAAP net loss of $3.3 million, or ($0.70) per share in the prior fiscal year quarter. Excluding the income statement impact of the warrants, stock compensation, restructuring charges, and other non-recurring costs, non-GAAP adjusted net loss in the quarter was $8.7 million, or ($1.82) per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $4.4 million, or ($0.93) per share in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA in fiscal second quarter 2025 was essentially breakeven at ($0.3) million, compared to $1.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and a $3.0 million improvement sequentially. \n\nFor a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, please see the financial reconciliation tables below. \n\n**Liquidity and Debt (as of September 30, 2024)**\n\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $17.0 million, compared to $25.8 million as of September 30, 2023. \n  * Total interest expense for the second quarter was $6.1 million, compared to $3.9 million for the same period a year ago. \n  * Outstanding term loan debt, excluding debt issuance costs, was $104.7 million, compared to $87.9 million as of September 30, 2023. Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility was $28.3 million, compared to $21.5 million as of September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n**Guidance**\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter of 2025, the Company expects the following guidance: \n\n  * Revenues of $72.0 million, plus or minus $2.0 million \n  * Non-GAAP adjusted basic net loss per share of ($0.75), plus or minus $0.05 \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.0 million \n\n\n\nThis assumes an effective annual tax rate of negative 3%; non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share assumes an average basic share count of approximately 4.8 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a live conference call today, November 13, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss these results.

Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure defined by us as net loss before restructuring charges, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, loss on debt extinguishment, non-recurring project costs, including restatement and debt-related matters and fair value of warrants adjustments. We calculate adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share using the above-referenced definition of adjusted net income (loss). \n\nWe have provided below reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted net income (loss), non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP operational expenses, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. We have presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and the board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operating plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business performance. For example, in the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we have excluded a large inventory reserve provision caused by global supply chain disruptions since the start of the pandemic and the longer associated lead times that resulted in older generation products being displaced by next-generation solutions. We do not believe an inventory adjustment of this magnitude is reasonably likely to reoccur in the foreseeable future and do not believe it is indicative of our ongoing operations; accordingly, we have excluded its impact from our non-GAAP results. We believe adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per basic and diluted share serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business and help our investors better compare our operating performance over multiple periods. Accordingly, we believe that the use of non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and our board of directors. \n\nOur use of non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: \n\n  * Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) interest and tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; (2) capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (3) changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (4) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation expense; (5) potential future costs related to our long-term debt; (6) potential future restructuring expenses; (7) potential future costs related to business acquisitions; (8) gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, (9) and acquisition-related amortization of intangibles assets from business combinations, or (10) fair market adjustments related to the Company’s warrants. \n  * Adjusted net income (loss) does not reflect: (1) potential future restructuring activities; (2) the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation expense; (3) potential future costs related to our long-term debt; (4) potential future costs related to business acquisitions; (5) gain (loss) on debt extinguishment; (6) acquisition-related amortization of intangibles assets from business combinations; or (7) fair market adjustments related to the Company’s warrants. \n\n\n\nOther companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income (loss) along with other U.S. GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics and our U.S. GAAP financial results. \n\nIn addition, this press release includes forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted earnings or net loss per share and adjusted EBITDA, each a non-GAAP measure used to describe our expected performance. We have not presented a reconciliation of these anticipated non-GAAP measures to our most comparable GAAP financial measures, because the reconciliation could not be prepared without unreasonable effort. The information necessary to prepare the reconciliations is not available on a forward-looking basis and cannot be accurately predicted.
