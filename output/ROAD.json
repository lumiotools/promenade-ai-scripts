Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate companies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Potential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the applicable periods.\n\n**Construction Partners, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**  \n**Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n**(in thousands, except percentages)**  \n**For the Fiscal Year** **Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023(2)**  \nNet income |  $ 68,935 |  $ 49,001  \nInterest expense, net |  19,071 |  17,346  \nProvision for income taxes |  23,161 |  16,403  \nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization  |  92,920 |  79,100  \nShare-based compensation expense |  15,031 |  10,759  \nAcquisition-related expenses (1) |  1,455 |  —  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ 220,573 |  $ 172,609  \nRevenues |  $ 1,823,889 |  $ 1,563,548  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin |  12.1 % |  11.0 %  \n  \n(1)  |  Reflects expenses associated with the acquisition of Lone Star Paving, which management views as a non-routine acquisition.  \n---|---  \n(2)  |  In periods commencing prior to September 30, 2023, the Company historically included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA an adjustment for management fees and expenses related to the Company's management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx Capital Partners, a member of the Company's control group.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate companies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies. Potential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the applicable periods.\n\n**Construction Partners, Inc.**  \n---  \n**Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**  \n**Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n**(in thousands, except percentages)**  \n**For the Fiscal Year** **Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023(2)**  \nNet income |  $ 68,935 |  $ 49,001  \nInterest expense, net |  19,071 |  17,346  \nProvision for income taxes |  23,161 |  16,403  \nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization  |  92,920 |  79,100  \nShare-based compensation expense |  15,031 |  10,759  \nAcquisition-related expenses (1) |  1,455 |  —  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ 220,573 |  $ 172,609  \nRevenues |  $ 1,823,889 |  $ 1,563,548  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin |  12.1 % |  11.0 %  \n  \n(1)  |  Reflects expenses associated with the acquisition of Lone Star Paving, which management views as a non-routine acquisition.  \n---|---  \n(2)  |  In periods commencing prior to September 30, 2023, the Company historically included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA an adjustment for management fees and expenses related to the Company's management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx Capital Partners, a member of the Company's control group.

All statements other than statements of\nhistorical fact may be forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often, but not always, identified by the use of words such as “seek,” “anticipate,” “plan,”\n“continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” “will,” “project,” “predict,” “potential,” “target,” “intend,” “could,” “might,” “should,” “believe,” “outlook” and similar expressions or\ntheir negative. Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by,\nwhich such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on management’s belief, based on currently available information, as to the outcome and\ntiming of future events.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee and Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we provide a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on\nhighways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. Consistent with our vertical integration strategy, our primary operations consist of (i)\nmanufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (“HMA”) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the\nconstruction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates,\nsuch as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both\ninternal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nConstruction Partners, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2007 as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction\nindustry.\nAs used in this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except when the context requires that those terms mean\nonly the parent company or a particular subsidiary.\nRecent Developments\n• ROAD-Map 2027. In October 2023, we publicly announced “ROAD-Map 2027,” a comprehensive business plan setting forth our strategic initiatives, growth priorities, and\nbusiness outlook through fiscal year 2027. ROAD-Map 2027 contemplates several revenue and growth goals, including, among others, revenues exceeding $3 billion by the\nend of fiscal year 2027.\n• 2024 Fiscal Year Acquisitions. During the 2024 fiscal year, we completed eight acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, Georgia,\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. As a result of these acquisitions, we added 11 asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction\nprofessionals. The total transaction consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $231.7 million. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 -\nBusiness Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n• Lone Star Paving Acquisition. On November 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt, Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving)\n(“Lone Star Paving” and such acquisition, the “Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas,\nwith 10 HMA plants, four aggregate facilities, and one liquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone\nStar Acquisition consisted of (i) $654.2 million in cash (as adjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company,\nLone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J. Wheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 3.0 million shares\nof Class A common stock. In addition, we agreed to (A) pay cash to the selling unit holders in an amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at\nclosing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification obligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in\nquarterly installments over four quarters following the closing, and (B) purchase from the selling unit holders for $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real\nproperty following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from the proceeds of the Term Loan B (as defined\nherein). For more information about the Lone Star Acquisition, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n• Term Loan B Credit Agreement. On November 1, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA\nSecurities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint\nbookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term\nloan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the\nTerm Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone\nStar Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit\nfacility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement (as defined below), (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing\ntransactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For more information\nabout the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n3\nTable of Contents\n• Credit Agreement Amendments. In May 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders party from time to time thereto (as amended from time to time, the\n“Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from $325.0 million to\n$400.0 million, (ii) reallocate $125.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the revolving credit facility to our term loan, (iii) add three new banks to our\nlender syndicate, (iv) provide for an additional incremental credit facility of up to $200.0 million and (v) update certain affirmative and negative covenants thereunder.\nAdditionally, on October 30, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star\nAcquisition, (ii) entry into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit\nAgreement on a pari passu basis with the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. For further discussion regarding\nthe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the foregoing amendments, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this report.\n• Stock Repurchase Program. In April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40 million is available to purchase shares of\nour outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our\nequity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of our Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at\nprevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at\nany time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased are determined by a committee of the board of\ndirectors at its discretion and depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and\neconomic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase\nprice of $10.0 million.\nWe operate in the large and growing highway and road construction industry and specifically within the asphalt paving materials and services segment. Asphalt paving mix is the\nmost common roadway material used today due to its cost effectiveness, durability and reusability, and minimized traffic disruption during paving, as compared to concrete. Recent\ngrowth in our industry has been driven by federal, state and local Department of Transportation (“DOT”) budgets, which annually earmark amounts for transportation and\ninfrastructure spending. In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law. The IIJA provides for $548 billion in new\ninfrastructure spending over five years through a reauthorization of traditional surface transportation programs and additional funding for highways, bridges and airports, among\nother things. In addition, certain states within our markets have recently approved legislation that supports funding for construction of local road, bridge and transit projects. The\nnon-discretionary nature of highway and road construction services and materials supports stable and consistent industry funding. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the\n“Inflation Reduction Act”) provides funding for numerous projects and initiatives relevant to the surface transportation industry, including grants for safety and environmental\nimprovements, incentives for the use of construction materials and products with lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and streamlined environmental review\nprocesses for proposed projects.\nProjects and Customers\nWe provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and\nresidential sites throughout the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We provide a wide range of large sitework\nconstruction, including site development, paving, and utility and drainage systems construction, and supply the HMA required for the projects. Our projects consist of both new\nconstruction and maintenance services. Publicly funded projects and third-party sales accounted for approximately 63%, and privately funded projects and third-party sales\naccounted for approximately 37%, of our fiscal 2024 revenues. Our public customers include federal agencies, state DOTs and local municipalities. Our private clients include\ncommercial and residential developers and businesses.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Florida DOT accounted for 13.6% of our revenues, and projects performed for all DOTs\naccounted for 40.7% of our revenues. Other than the Florida DOT, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nOur 25 largest projects accounted for 15.7% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nTypes of Contracts\nOur public customer contracts are primarily fixed unit price contracts. Pricing on a fixed unit price contract is typically based on approved quantities. Our private customer contracts\nare primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. We also occasionally enter\ninto design-build contracts, which generally are performed under fixed total price contracts. For the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment when\n4\nTable of Contents\ncontracts are near completion or fully completed. For some contracts, we are required to furnish a warranty on our construction. These warranties, when required, are usually one\nyear in length, but can extend up to three years according to the owners’ specifications. Historically, warranty claims have not been material to our business.\nContract Management\nWe identify potential contracts through a variety of sources, including: (i) subscriber services that consolidate and alert us to contracts open for bidding; (ii) posted solicitations by\nfederal, state and local governmental entities through agency websites, disclosure of long-term infrastructure plans or advertising and other general solicitations; (iii) our business\ndevelopment efforts; and (iv) communications with other participants in our industry. We consider several factors that can create variability in contract performance and our\nfinancial results compared to our bid assumptions and methodologies on a contract. As a result, after determining the potential contracts that are available, we decide which\ncontracts to pursue based on a non-exclusive list of factors, which include relevant skills required by the contract, the contract size and duration, availability of our personnel and\nequipment, size and makeup of our current contract backlog, our competitive advantages and disadvantages, our prior experience, the contracting agency or customer, the source of\ncontract funding, the geographic location, the likely competition, the construction risks, the gross margin opportunities, the penalties or incentives and the type of contract.\nTo ensure the completeness and accuracy of our original bid analysis, the bid preparation for potential projects typically involves three phases.\n• Phase One: We review the plans and specifications of the project so that we can identify (i) the various types of work involved and related estimated materials, (ii) the\ncontract duration and schedule, and (iii) any unique aspects or significant risk factors of the project.\n• Phase Two: We estimate the cost and availability of labor, materials and equipment, subcontractors and the project team required to complete the contract in accordance\nwith the plans, specifications and construction schedule. Substantially all of our estimates are made on a per-unit basis for each bid item, with the typical contract containing\n50 to 200 bid items.\n• Phase Three: Management conducts a detailed review of the estimate. This review includes an analysis of assumptions regarding (i) cost, approach, means and methods of\ncompleting the project, (ii) staffing and productivity and (iii) risk. After concluding this detailed review of the cost estimate, management determines the appropriate profit\nmargin to calculate the total bid amount. This profit margin varies according to management’s perception of the degree of difficulty of the contract, the existing competitive\nclimate and the size and makeup of our contract backlog. Throughout this process, we work closely with our project managers so that all issues concerning a contract,\nincluding any risks, can be better understood and addressed as appropriate.\nTo ensure that subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts do not change, we obtain firm quotations from our subcontractors before submitting a bid.\nAlso, to mitigate the risk of material price changes, we obtain “not to exceed” quotations from our suppliers, which, for projects of longer duration, usually contain price escalator\nprovisions. These quotations typically include quantity guarantees that are tied to our prime contract. We have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those\nrequired to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided.\nAfter a contract has been awarded and during the construction phase, we monitor our progress by comparing actual costs incurred and quantities completed to date with budgeted\namounts and the project schedule. We review our estimates of total forecasted revenue, cost and expected profit for each contract monthly.\nDuring the normal course of some projects, we or our customer may initiate modifications or changes to the original contract to reflect, among other things, changes in quantities,\nspecifications or design, method or manner of performance, facilities, materials, site conditions and period for completion of the work. Generally, the scope and price of these\nmodifications are documented in a “change order” to the original contract and reviewed, approved and paid for in accordance with the normal change order provisions of the\ncontract. Occasionally, we are asked to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the\nwork to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original contract plans and\nspecifications or, even if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not\nbe settled to our satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for an extended period of time until the\nchange order is approved and funded by the customer. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other work on the contract (or\non other contracts) and our ability to meet contract milestone dates. Historically, we have been successful at managing the impacts caused by change orders, and change orders\nhave not had a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our contracts with governmental agencies provide for termination at the convenience of the customer, with requirements to pay us for work performed through the date of\ntermination. The termination of a government contract for the convenience of the customer\n5\nTable of Contents\nis an extremely rare occurrence. Many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met.\nHistorically, we have not been materially adversely affected by liquidated damages provisions.\nWe act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects. As prime contractor, we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. To\nmanage the risk of non-performance by our subcontractors, we typically require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee its performance and/or we\nretain payments in accordance with contract terms until their performance is complete. Disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our good faith efforts to\nsubcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers.\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2023. Contract backlog is a financial measure that generally reflects the\ndollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in the future. Although contract backlog is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”), it is a common measure used in our industry. We generally include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent\nwe believe funding is probable. Our backlog generally consists of uncompleted work on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not\ncommenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include (i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive\nconfirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing\ncontractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of uncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet\nbegun was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur backlog also includes low bid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private\nwork projects for which we have been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog\nwas $0.5 billion and $0.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we expected approximately 76% of our contract backlog to be completed\nduring the next 12 months.\nCertain customer contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of our customer to award additional work to us, without requiring us to go through an additional\ncompetitive bidding process. In addition, some customer contracts also contain task orders that are signed under master contracts pursuant to which we perform work only when the\ncustomer awards specific task orders to us. Awarded contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog to the extent that\nthe exercise of such options or the issuance of such task orders is probable.\nSubstantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog, as well as unexercised contract options and unissued task orders, may be canceled or modified at the election of the\ncustomer. Historically, we have not experienced material amounts of contract cancellations or modifications. Many projects are added to our contract backlog and completed within\nthe same fiscal year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or year-end contract backlog. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA, aggregates, and\nliquid asphalt cement.\nInsurance and Bonding\nWe maintain general and excess liability, property, workers’ compensation and medical insurance, all in amounts consistent with industry practice.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security to the customer for our performance\nunder certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and\nexternal factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have bonded and\ntheir underwriting standards. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of\nsurety market consolidation.\nCompetition\nWe compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Competition is constrained in our industry because participants are limited by the distance\nthat materials can be efficiently transported, resulting in a fragmented market with thousands of participants nationwide, many of which are local or regional operators. Our\ncompetitors typically range from small, family-owned companies focused on a single material, product or market to multinational corporations that offer a wide array of\nconstruction materials, products and paving and related services. Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, estimating abilities, knowledge of local markets and\nconditions, project management, financial strength, reputation for quality, aggregate materials\n6\nTable of Contents\navailability and machinery and equipment. We believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in\nparticular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and\noperations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in\nthe construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher\nactivity and revenues during those quarters. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter\nvaries greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenue, while a warm, dry spring may\nfacilitate earlier project commencement dates.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe purchase raw materials, including, but not limited to, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt, other petroleum-based resources, sand and rock from numerous sources. With few exceptions,\nwe do not enter into long-term agreements to purchase raw materials. We receive quotes from suppliers, most with a “not to exceed” price for the quoted product over the life of a\nproject. In the HMA production process, components of a mix include virgin aggregates, such as sand and rock, liquid asphalt, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (“RAP”). We are\nable to internally supply RAP, a byproduct of asphalt resurfacing projects, to all of our HMA plants, and virgin aggregates in some of our market areas. The majority of our HMA\nplants sit in or near suppliers’ aggregates facilities, thereby reducing the hauling cost of material to our plant. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year\ndue to market conditions and production capacities. We do not expect a lack of availability of any raw materials over the next 12 months.\nGovernment and Environmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the environmental, health and safety aspects of our operations or\notherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations and limitations on our operations, including:\n• zoning and other requirements to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities;\n• restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment;\n• limitation or prohibition of activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas;\n• obligations to restore or reclaim former mining areas;\n• requirements to comply with specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and\n• the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nSuch federal laws include, but are not limited to, (i) the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Pollution Prevention\nAct and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, governing solid and hazardous waste management, (ii) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water\nAct and the Safe Drinking Water Act, protecting air and water resources, and (iii) the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and Toxic Substances Control Act,\ngoverning the management of hazardous materials, (iv) the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, requiring certain disclosures of mining-related health and safety violations,\norders, citations, assessments, legal actions, and mining-related fatalities, and (v) the Occupational Safety and Health Act, governing working conditions for workers, in addition to\nanalogous state laws. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and corresponding state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance\nwith these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to\ncomply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, injunctive relief, the\nimposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in\nobtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where\nhazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed, stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned\nor operated by us or at which we have disposed of materials, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from the consequences of our\n7\nTable of Contents\nown actions that complied with applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide\nindemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could\nresult in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to\nreceive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental,\nhealth and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is\nmade against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental\nlegislation and regulations applied to the construction industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. To the extent that laws are enacted or other\ngovernmental action is taken that restricts our operations or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business,\nprospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities may\nincrease our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.\nWe regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our\noperations and facilities, whether owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any existing non-compliance is not\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nIndustrial operations, including equipment maintenance and storage, asphalt manufacturing and processing, underground storage tank usage and other storage and use of hazardous\nmaterials and petroleum products, are conducted at our facilities, and in some cases, have been conducted at our facilities for more than 50 years. While we have conducted our\noperations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, we have, from time to time, identified contamination associated with these activities at certain of our\nfacilities. We have incurred costs in connection with the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances and petroleum products identified at several facilities, and\ninvestigation and remediation activities are ongoing at others. We may also become subject to similar liabilities in connection with prior and future acquisitions. We do not believe\nthat liabilities associated with known or potential contamination at any of our facilities will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we employed 1,325 salaried employees and 3,595 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel at a given time is subject to the volume of\nprojects in progress and fluctuates on a seasonal basis. During fiscal year 2024, the number of hourly employees ranged from 3,044 to 3,595 employees and averaged 3,256\nemployees. As of November 20, 2024, after giving effect to the Lone Star Acquisition, we employed 1,484 salaried employees and 4,218 hourly employees. We are not subject to\nany collective bargaining agreements with respect to any of our employees. We believe that we have strong relationships with our employees.\nOur business depends on a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Attracting, training and retaining key personnel has been and will remain\ncritical to our success. Through the use of our management information systems, on-the-job training, and educational seminars, employees are trained to understand the importance\nof project execution. We place additional focus on training related to estimating, project management and project cost control. Our crews typically specialize in a specific phase of\nconstruction, such as grading or paving, with each crew member assigned to a specific task in order to maximize daily production. A core tenet of our organizational philosophy is\nto promote from within and offer advancement opportunities at all levels of employment, which helps us retain talented employees. Moreover, we proactively recruit additional\ntalent in both conventional and creative manners to fill open positions when promoting internally is not an option. Like others in our industry, we experience some recurring\nemployee turnover; however, we have historically been able to attract sufficient numbers of personnel to support the growth of our operations. Nonetheless, we continue to face\ncompetition for experienced workers in all of our markets.\nWe place a great emphasis on the safety of the public, our customers and our employees. To that end, we conduct extensive safety training programs, which have allowed us to\nmaintain a high safety level at our worksites. All newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation, and for certain types of projects and processes, we conduct specific\nhazard training programs. Our project foremen and superintendents conduct on-site safety meetings, and our full-time safety inspectors make random site safety inspections and\nperform assessments. In addition, certain operational employees are required to complete a safety course approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(“OSHA”) or the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), as applicable. Moreover, we promote a culture of safety by encouraging employees to immediately correct and\nreport all unsafe conditions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWebsite Information\nWe maintain a website at www.constructionpartners.net.

Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this\nreport, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. As a\nresult, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face.\nAdditional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, particularly in the southern United States, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions or uncertainty\nregarding the economic outlook in the United States generally, or in any of these states particularly, could reduce demand for infrastructure projects. Demand for infrastructure\nprojects depends on overall economic conditions, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and\nfederal, state and local government spending levels. In particular, low tax revenues, credit rating downgrades, budget deficits and financing constraints, including timing and\namount of federal funding and competing governmental priorities, could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new public infrastructure projects.\nIn addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already in\nprogress, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our contract backlog and could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund\nnew construction projects, including through the issuance of municipal bonds.\nOur business depends on federal, state and local government spending for public infrastructure construction, and reductions in government funding could adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 63% of our construction contract revenues from publicly funded construction projects and the sale of\nconstruction materials to public customers at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, if publicly funded construction decreases due to reduced federal, state or local funding or\notherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent the maximum amounts available for federally funded construction projects. Each year, Congress passes an\nappropriation act establishing the amount that can be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the federal\nHighway Trust Fund. Once Congress passes the annual appropriation, the federal government distributes funds to each state based on formulas or other procedures. States generally\nmust spend these funds on the specific programs outlined in the federal legislation. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has faced insolvency as outlays have outpaced\nrevenues, and annual shortfalls have been addressed primarily by short-term measures. In November 2021, the IIJA was signed into law, which provided additional funding for\nhighways, bridges and airports over a five-year period. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022 has provided funding for a variety of infrastructure-related\nprograms. Although these laws provide for funding at historically high levels, the timing, nature and scale of the projects for which these funds under these programs or otherwise\nwill be used remains uncertain given variations in the appropriation processes at the federal and state levels. As a result, we cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of\nfuture federal highway funding. Federal highway funding is also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional spending as a whole, including the potential impacts of\nbudget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Any reduction in federal highway funding, particularly in the amounts allocated to states in which we operate,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEach state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various state taxes, typically fuel taxes and vehicle fees, as well as from voter-approved\nbond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amount spent or delay expenditures on state infrastructure projects. Many states have experienced state-level funding\npressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. Any reduction in state infrastructure funding in the states in which we operate could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from state DOTs. The loss of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Florida DOT accounted for 13.6% of our revenues, and projects performed for all state\nDOTs accounted for 40.7% of our revenues. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we completed the Lone Star Acquisition. The customers of Lone Star Paving\ninclude the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”), local municipalities, heavy civil contractors, and commercial and residential developers. As result of the Lone Star\nAcquisition, we anticipate that TxDOT will be among our top five customers (based on revenues) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. We believe that we will continue to\nrely on state DOTs for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully\ncontract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies,\nConcentration of Risks, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information relating to concentrations of revenues by type of customer and for\na description of our largest customers.\nGovernment contracts generally are subject to a variety of regulations, requirements and statutes, the violation or alleged violation of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nOur contracts with governmental agencies are generally subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to\ntheir formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. We may be subject to claims for civil or criminal\nfraud for actual or alleged violations of these governmental regulations, requirements or statutes. In addition, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private\nindividuals on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these\nregulations, requirements or statutes, or if we have a substantial number of workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be\nsuspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Even if we have not violated these regulations, requirements or\nstatutes, allegations of violations or defending qui tam litigation could harm our reputation and require us to incur material costs to defend any such allegations or lawsuits. Any one\nor more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe cancellation of a significant number of contracts, our disqualification from bidding on new contracts and the unpredictable timing of new project opportunities could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment contracts typically can be canceled at any time, with us receiving payment only for the work completed. The cancellation of an unfinished contract could result in lost\nrevenues and cause our equipment to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on\ncertain government contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. For example, various laws, including those governing wages, benefits, overtime,\nworking conditions, equal employment opportunity, affirmative action and drug testing, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances\ninvolving violations of those laws. In addition, federal and state laws provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances, including as a result of being\nconvicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The\nscope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts of a particular case and the grounds for debarment. Finally, the timing of project awards is\nunpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding\nprocesses.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower profits than anticipated.\nPricing on fixed unit price contracts is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for an\nagreed-upon price irrespective of our actual costs. We generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts only when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which\nrequires us to accurately estimate and control our costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then\ncost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary,\nsometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n10\nTable of Contents\n• the failure to include materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a fixed total price contract;\n• delays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\n• contract or project modifications or conditions creating unanticipated costs that are not covered by change orders;\n• changes in the availability, proximity and costs of materials, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials, as well as fuel and lubricants for\nour equipment;\n• to the extent not covered by contractual cost escalators, variability in, and our inability to predict, the costs of diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and cement;\n• the availability and skill level of workers;\n• onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n• the failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\n• fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or personnel;\n• mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\n• citations issued by a government authority, including OSHA or MSHA;\n• difficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\n• changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n• uninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\n• public infrastructure customers seeking to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions that result in increased risks to us.\nThese and other factors may cause us to incur losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, some of which we may not be able to recoup.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to pass through\nincreased costs to our customers. In recent years, we experienced an upward trend in several inflation-sensitive inputs that we use to provide our products and services, including\nupward pressure on wages and increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA and other items critical to our business, including fuel, concrete and steel. We also\nexperienced disruptions from various participants in our supply chains, including subcontractors, materials suppliers and equipment manufacturers, who provide the raw materials,\nequipment, vehicles, construction supplies and other services we require in order to manufacture HMA and perform our construction projects. Although we have been able to\nmitigate some of the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions and upward wage pressures on our business by increasing prices for our products and including the anticipated\ncost increases in the construction projects for which we bid, we may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for\nprojects already in our backlog, and if we are unable to do so, we may not recoup our losses or diminished profit margins. If we experience significant inflation or supply chain\ndisruptions going forward, we may be required to implement further price adjustments to maintain our profit margin, and any price increases may have a negative effect on\ndemand.\n11\nTable of Contents\nBecause our industry is capital-intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services are expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain\nsuch assets. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our\ncurrently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our\nbusiness, or if the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In\naddition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, particularly at our HMA production facilities, aggregates facilities and our mobile equipment\nfleets, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy, to successfully integrate acquired businesses and to retain key employees of\nacquired businesses.\nSince our inception, we have acquired and integrated 48 complementary businesses, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We continue to evaluate strategic\nacquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business, including acquisitions in the southern United States, as part of our ongoing growth strategy.\nWe cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions. To successfully acquire a target, we may need to raise additional equity and/or incur additional indebtedness, which\ncould increase our leverage level. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisition transactions on favorable terms, or at all. The investigation of acquisition candidates and\nthe negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments require substantial management time and attention and costs for\naccountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed\nacquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired company’s estimation, project management, finance, information technology, risk management, purchasing and fleet\nmanagement functions. We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired business into our existing business, and an acquired business may not be as profitable as we had\nexpected or at all. Acquisitions involve risks that the acquired business will not perform as expected and that our expectations concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the\nacquired business will prove incorrect. Our inability to successfully integrate new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce profits or generate losses\nand prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business. Factors affecting the successful integration of an acquired business include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n• our responsibility for certain liabilities of an acquired business, whether or not known to us, which could include, among other things, tax liabilities, product and other tort\nliabilities, breach of contract claims, environmental liabilities, permitting and regulatory compliance issues and liabilities for employment practices;\n• our ability to retain local managers and key employees who are important to the operations of an acquired business;\n• the attention required by our senior management and the management of an acquired business for integration efforts, which could decrease the time that they have to service\nand attract customers;\n• our ability to effectively utilize new equipment that we acquire;\n• the implementation of our financial and management information systems, business practices and policies;\n• our pursuit of multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously; and\n• unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nIn addition, potential acquisition targets may be in states in which we do not currently operate. For example, on November 1, 2024, we acquired Lone Star Paving in Texas, a\ngeographic region in which the Company has not historically operated. The Lone Star Acquisition or any future acquisition in a new geographic region could result in unforeseen\noperating challenges and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities and subject us to unfamiliar legal requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with recent and future acquisitions. Many of the businesses that we previously acquired, and\nbusinesses that we may acquire in the future, could have unaudited financial statements that are prepared by management and are not independently reviewed or audited, and such\nfinancial statements could be materially different if they were independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations\nconsistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We also cannot know whether there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable\nprices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these\nacquisitions could, in the future, result in\n12\nTable of Contents\nimpairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly.\nWe may lose business to competitors that underbid us and may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nMost of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor. Because of the high cost of transporting HMA, our\nability to win a project award is often influenced by the distance between a work site and our HMA plants. We compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in\nwhich we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and are vertically integrated. As a result, our competitors may be able to bid at lower prices than we can due to\nthe location of their plants or as a result of their size or vertical integration advantages. Government funding for public infrastructure projects is limited, contributing to competition\nfor the limited number of public projects available. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins. In addition, in the\nevent of a downturn in private residential and commercial construction, the competition for available public infrastructure projects could intensify, which could materially and\nadversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could preclude us from bidding on certain projects.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Sureties typically issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so\nat any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends on our capitalization,\nworking capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Events that adversely affect\nthe insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we are unable to obtain or renew a sufficient level of\nbonding, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be precluded from bidding on certain projects or successfully contracting with certain customers, which could limit the\naggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required\nto post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather and climate conditions, which can adversely impact our business.\nOur construction operations occur outdoors in an area of the country in which weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes and tropical storms are common and snow frequently\noccurs in certain markets in the winter. For example, Hurricanes Debby, Francine and Helene all made landfall in the southeastern United States during our fourth fiscal quarter of\n2024 and disrupted operations in various portions of our geographic footprint through flooding, extended power outages and road closures, among other issues. These and similar\nseasonal changes and adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather, can adversely affect our business operations through a decline in the use and\nproduction of HMA, a decline in the demand for our construction services, alterations and delays in our construction schedules, extended power outages limiting the use of plants\nand equipment and reduced efficiencies in our contracting operations, resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Climate change may\nlead to increased extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy\nperiods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and processes, which are subject to cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure that could be damaged or interrupted by a variety of factors. Any significant breach, breakdown, destruction or\ninterruption of these systems has the potential to negatively affect our operations. We could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a\nresult of a cybersecurity attack, such as the infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or through our third-party providers. Although\nwe have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, our efforts\nmay not prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Similarly, our\nsuppliers rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage their businesses and, thus, are also at risk of, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks.\nAlthough we have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident or business interruption event to date, an interruption in the business operations of our suppliers and other third\nparties with which we do business resulting from a cybersecurity attack could indirectly impact our business operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build contracts are used as a method of project delivery that provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally\nsubcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission that causes damages, there is a risk that the\nsubcontractor and/or its errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the full amount of the liability incurred. In this case, we may be responsible for the remaining\nliability, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into joint venture contracts to perform certain projects, and these arrangements expose us to certain risks and uncertainties that are outside of our\ncontrol.\nFrom time to time, we perform construction projects as part of a joint venture, under which our relationship to the other joint venture partners is governed by a written contract.\nParticipation in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that our partners may fail to perform under the contracts, which could subject us to\ncontractual liability. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or the joint venture\narrangement is terminated, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the project, or we could be liable for financial penalties or liquidated damages. In the event that we are not\nthe controlling partner in the joint venture, we may have limited control over the decisions made with respect to the project. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur continued success requires us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited to, our executive officers and key management\npersonnel. In addition, we rely on engineers, project management personnel, other employees and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and\nexpertise to perform their respective services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it may be difficult to attract\nand retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and within the time frame demanded by our customers. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to\nsatisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel. Also, it could be difficult to replace personnel who hold\ncredentials that may be required to perform certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.\nAs some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we must provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to\nidentify and integrate new personnel into vacant leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively\nimplement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects and our strategic plan may be adversely affected, the costs of executing both our existing and future projects\nmay increase, and our financial performance may decline.\nIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award\ntiming can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from\nexcess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases.\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs from time to time,\nincluding high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced material disruptions due to labor\nshortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee\nbase could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to\ncomplete our construction projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of\nperforming at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended\nnegative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking\ncapacity due to shortages of drivers and increased fuel costs has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled\nlabor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on third parties for equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease real property, plants and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction\nmaterials necessary for our operations. The inability to purchase or lease the properties, plants or equipment that are necessary for our operations could severely impact our\nbusiness. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers’ needs, or if our suppliers experience price increases or\ndisruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, financial or regulatory difficulties or distribution problems, our ability to bid for or complete contracts could\nbe impaired, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of raw materials needed for HMA production, equipment, vehicles and construction supplies, could increase our costs or cause delays\nin our ability to complete our projects, which could have an adverse impact on our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely on our supply chain for raw materials to manufacture HMA and for equipment, vehicles and construction supplies in order to complete our projects. A reduction or\ninterruption in supply, including disruptions due to shortages in global freight capacity, significant increases in the price of critical components and raw materials, a failure to\nappropriately forecast or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, a significant natural disaster or volatility in demand for our products and services could materially\nadversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Our vendors and subcontractors also may be unable to\nmeet our demand, significantly increase lead times for deliveries or impose significant price increases that we are unable to offset through alternate sources of supply, price\nincreases to our customers or increased productivity in our operations. In some cases, we procure certain inputs and services from single or limited suppliers or subcontractors. In\nthe event of supply disruptions from these suppliers or subcontractors, we may not be able to diversify our resources for such materials or services in a timely manner or may\nexperience quality issues with alternate sources. Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in large part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials,\nplant components, equipment and vehicles from our suppliers, and significant disruptions in their supply could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.\nWe consume natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints and\nsignificant price fluctuations.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The\navailability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control, such as unavailability due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for\npetroleum-based products and other factors. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers\ncontract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted if our suppliers are unable to obtain these materials due to higher demand or\nother factors that interrupt their availability. Additionally, increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products utilized in our operations, particularly increases\nfollowing a bid based on lower costs for such products, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to reductions in scope and cancellations and therefore could be an unreliable indicator of our future earnings.\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2023. Our contract backlog generally consists of construction projects for\nwhich we either have an executed contract or commitment with a client or have submitted the currently lowest bid. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA,\naggregates and liquid asphalt cement. Moreover, our contract backlog reflects our expected revenues from the contract, commitment or bid, which is often subject to revision over\ntime. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be\naffected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these\nprojects.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as expected could have a negative impact on our results.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work.\nAlthough we often require bonding or other forms of guarantees from our subcontractors, we are not always able to obtain such bonds or guarantees. In situations where we are\nunable to obtain a bond or guarantee, we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated. In addition, if the total costs of a project\nexceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule-driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or\nexpose us to financial liability.\nIn some instances, including in the case of many of our fixed unit price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. Any failure to meet the contractual\nschedule or satisfy the completion requirements set forth in our contracts could subject us to responsibility for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually\nagreed-upon liquidated damages, liability for our customer’s actual costs arising out of our delay, reduced profits or a loss on that project and/or damage to our reputation, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAn inability to secure sufficient aggregates reserves could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nStrict governmental regulations and the limited number of properties containing useful aggregates reserves have made it increasingly challenging and costly to obtain sufficient\naggregates to support our business, both with respect to internal use and third-party sales. If we are unable to obtain adequate reserves to support our business, then our\nfinancial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy, and a majority of our contracts require us to maintain specific types and amounts of coverage.\nAlthough we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nFor example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate\ninsurance coverage, we would be subject to increased out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim and we may not be able to procure certain contracts, either of which could\nmaterially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified “disadvantaged business enterprises” to perform as subcontractors, which could cause us to breach certain contracts\nwith governmental customers.\nSome of our contracts with governmental agencies contain minimum “disadvantaged business enterprise” (“DBE”) participation clauses, which require us to maintain a requisite\nlevel of DBE participation. If we fail to obtain or maintain the required level of DBE participation, we could be held responsible for breach of contract. Such a breach could impair\nour ability to bid on future projects and could require us to pay monetary damages. To the extent that we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could\nexceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of\noperations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses, which could materially affect our business and reputation.\nBecause our employees and others are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical substances and dangerous manufacturing processes, our\nconstruction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces. Therefore, safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. We\nare often responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. In addition, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts,\nand some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, which increases project costs and\ntherefore our overall operating costs. If we fail to implement effective safety procedures, our employees could be injured, the completion of a project could be delayed, or we could\nbe exposed to investigations and possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could also result in reduced profitability or the\nloss of projects or clients.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nWe provide our customers with products designed to comply with building codes or other regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable contractual specifications, including,\nbut not limited to, with respect to durability, compressive strength and weight-bearing capacity. If our products do not satisfy these requirements and specifications, material claims\nmay arise against us, our reputation could be damaged and, if any such claims are for an uninsured, non-indemnified or product-related matter, then resolution of such claims\nagainst us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe are, and may continue to be, involved in routine litigation and government inquiries in the ordinary course of business.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things,\nworkers’ compensation claims, employment-related disputes and issues related to liability, breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with our performance of services and\nprovision of materials. We are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction\ncontracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not\nexpected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, although adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary\ncourse inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nresults of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants and materials into the environment or otherwise\nrelating to environmental protection and public health and safety. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including requirements to\nobtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the\nenvironment; limitations on activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and assessments of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting\nfrom our operations. For example, a number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory actions to reduce emissions of\ngreenhouse gases, such as monitoring, reporting and emissions control requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs.\nBecause we emit greenhouse gases through the manufacture of HMA products and through the combustion of fossil fuels as part of our mining and road construction services, any\nsuch laws and regulations applicable to jurisdictions in which we operate could require us to incur costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or third-party facilities that receive\nwaste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions or those of others and whether such actions complied with applicable\nlaws at the time they were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could\nexpose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties that we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our\nability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes. For example, our lease agreements associated with our aggregates facilities could, if not appropriately\nmanaged, subject us to specific reclamation obligations, costs, or liabilities for any contamination or regulatory violations arising from our mining operations.\nNumerous government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and the\npermits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability\n(i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) or joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have\nbeen stored or released. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties,\ncompensatory damages, injunctive relief, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In\naddition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to\nreceive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental,\nhealth and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is\nmade against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental\nlegislation and regulations applied to our industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and, consequently, affecting profitability. Additionally, legal\nrequirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities may increase our future\nexpenditures to comply with environmental requirements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change and related laws and regulations could adversely affect us.\nThe potential impact of climate change on our operations and our customers remains uncertain. The primary risk that climate change poses to our business is the potential for\nincreases in the volume, frequency and intensity of rainfall and tropical storms, which would impair our ability to perform our construction projects. Climate change could also lead\nto disruptions in our supply chain, thereby impairing our production capabilities, or the distribution of our products due to major storm events or prolonged adverse conditions,\nchanging temperature levels or flooding from sea level changes, especially in our coastal markets. These changes could be severe and\n17\nTable of Contents\ncould negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change could, if adopted, restrict our operations, require us to\nmake capital or other expenditures to comply with these initiatives, increase our costs, impact our ability to compete or negatively impact efforts to obtain permits, licenses and\nother approvals for existing and new facilities. Our inability to timely respond to the risks posed by climate change and the costs of compliance with climate change laws and\nregulations could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIncreasing focus by stakeholders on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices could result in additional costs and could adversely impact our\nreputation, investor perception, employee retention and willingness of third parties to do business with us.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing focus from stakeholders, including government agencies, investors, consumers and employees, on our ESG policies and practices.\nAdditionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continues to grow. If our policies and practices do not meet regulatory\nrequirements or stakeholders’ evolving expectations for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, employee health and safety practices,\ndirector and employee diversity, human capital management and corporate governance, our reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and\nsuppliers may be unwilling to do business with us. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state laws in connection with our operations, and inconsistency in legislation\nand regulations among jurisdictions and expected additional regulations may require greater resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices. Any assessment of\nthe potential impact of future ESG-related regulations or industry standards is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change where we operate. As a result, the\neffects of increased focus by stakeholders on ESG matters could have short- and long-term impacts on our business and operations.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses that may not be covered by\ninsurance.\nOperating hazards inherent in our business, some of which may be outside of our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and\nenvironmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may be inadequate or\nunavailable to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts\nare accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are\ndifficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of unreported incidents\nand the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we may be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims\nrather than for maintaining or expanding our operations.\nOur failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities, harm our reputation with our customers and disrupt our operations.\nAlthough we take steps to verify the employment eligibility status of all of our employees, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers.\nUnauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse\npublicity that could make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause\ntemporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related\nto claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, our operations may be\ndisrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration\nlaws, and, in some cases, our customers’ audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure that our subcontractors comply with these laws\nwith respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws or to ensure compliance by our subcontractors could damage our reputation and may\ncause our customers to cancel contracts with us or to not award future business to us. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nFederal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to fines and lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which\ngoverns such matters as minimum wages, the Family Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour\nlaws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. As our employees are located in a number\nof states, compliance with these evolving federal, state\n18\nTable of Contents\nand local laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business. In recent years, companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits,\nalleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, overtime wage policies, discrimination and similar matters, some of which have resulted\nin the payment of meaningful damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits may be threatened or instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur damages and expenses\nresulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently subject to employee-\nrelated legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably\nestimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur debt consists primarily of our borrowings under our (i) Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior first lien term loan facility, under which $392.2\nmillion of principal was outstanding at as of September 30, 2024 (the “Term Loan A”) and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) Term\nLoan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party from time to time thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement,” and\ntogether with the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”), which provides for a fully drawn senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $850 million (the “Term Loan B,” and together with the Term Loan A, the “Term Loans”).\nA significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Among other consequences, this level of indebtedness could:\n• require us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes;\n• limit our ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n• cause our interest expense to increase if there is a general increase in interest rates, because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n• cause us to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n• make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; and\n• limit our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets, including due to changes in interest rates in the United States, may further increase our interest payments. We have secured overnight financing rate\n(“SOFR”)-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreements, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. SOFR has\na limited history as a reference rate, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest\nwe may pay on our variable rate indebtedness is difficult to predict.\nAlthough the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur\nsubstantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. This could reduce our ability to satisfy our current obligations and further exacerbate the risks to our\nfinancial condition described above.\nThe Credit Agreements restrict our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe Credit Agreements contain a number of covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, create liens on assets, change our or our subsidiaries’\nfiscal year, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain restrictive agreements, engage in mergers or consolidations, participate in partnerships and joint ventures,\nsell assets, incur additional liens, pay dividends or distributions and make other restricted payments, make investments, loans or advances, repay or amend the terms of subordinated\nindebtedness, make acquisitions, enter into certain operating leases, enter into certain hedge transactions, amend material contracts and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio, and the Credit Agreements contain\ncertain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of\ndefault occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreements will be entitled to accelerate amounts due thereunder and take\n19\nTable of Contents\nother actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor, subject to an intercreditor agreement between the administrative agent under each Credit Agreement on behalf of the\nlenders party to each Credit Agreement. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or\nthat we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to operate our business or\nachieve our growth objectives.\nOur ongoing ability to generate cash is important for funding our continuing operations, making acquisitions and servicing our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash\nbalances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide\nneeded working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part on prevailing market\nconditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial\ninstitutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our Revolving Credit Facility may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not\navailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make certain investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities or respond to competitive challenges, each of\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be required to record an impairment charge if we determine that goodwill recorded in connection with prior acquisitions has become impaired, and this determination\nrequires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had $231.7 million and $159.3 million, respectively, of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess goodwill for\nimpairment annually or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective and require significant judgment\nregarding highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an\nimpairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment\ncharge, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our\nmanagement. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards that we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require us to make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and\napplying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We\nmake critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters, including with respect to revenue recognition, contracts receivable including retainage, valuation of long-\nlived assets and goodwill, income taxes, accrued insurance costs and share-based payments and other equity transactions. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are\ninherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate\nassumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously\nrecognized revenues and profit. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different methods to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ, which could\nhave a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. For more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”\nUnfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition and overall results of\noperations.\nActual events, concerns or speculation about disruption or instability in the banking and financial services industry, such as liquidity constraints, the failure of individual\ninstitutions, or the inability of individual institutions or the banking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractual obligations, could significantly impair our\naccess to capital, delay access to deposits or other financial assets, or cause actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. Similarly, these events, concerns or\nspeculation could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations\non access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our customers, critical vendors and\nbusiness partners also could be adversely affected by these risks as described above, which in turn could result in their committing a breach or default under their contractual\nagreements with us, their insolvency or bankruptcy, or other adverse effects. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources, or non-compliance of\nbanking and financial services counterparties with their contractual commitments to us could, among other risks, have material adverse impacts on our ability to meet our operating\nexpenses and other financial needs, could result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations and could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risks\nForce majeure events, such as natural disasters, pandemics and terrorist attacks, and unexpected equipment failures could negatively impact our business, which may affect\nour financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which\nwe operate. As an example, from time to time, we face unexpected severe weather conditions, evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, increased labor and material\ncosts or shortages, inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We seek to include language\nin our contracts with private customers that grants us certain relief in connection with force majeure events, and we attempt to mitigate the potential impact arising from force\nmajeure events in both public and private customer contracts. However, the extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our customers, and we remain\nobligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events, subject to any relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. Additionally, our manufacturing\nprocesses depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as our HMA plants. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage. Any\nsignificant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage and cause us to lose revenues due to lost\nproduction time. These force majeure events and unexpected equipment failures may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues,\nproduction capability and ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with our financial reporting and corporate governance requirements, including\nrequirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and rules implemented by the SEC. For example, as a publicly\ntraded company, we are required to adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal control over\nfinancial reporting. These rules and regulations have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,\nand we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult\nfor us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have designed and implemented a number of internal controls and other remedial measures that we believe will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a material misstatement\nof our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or\ncause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and impact our liquidity, perceived creditworthiness and ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs related to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”). If we are unable\nto timely comply with such requirements, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s\nassessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. The\nout-of-pocket costs, diversion of management’s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of\nSection 404 have been significant, and we expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance efforts. If we fail to comply with the requirements of\nSection 404, or if we or our auditors identify and report any material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially\nadversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of\ncustomers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and require additional expenditures to comply with these\nrequirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n21\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, which limits the ability of holders of\nour Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of November 20, 2024, our outstanding Class B common stock\nrepresented approximately 65.5% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. The shares of Class B common stock are owned primarily by (i) SunTx Capital\nPartners, a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas (“SunTx”), and funds that it manages, (ii) SunTx principals and their respective affiliates and family members, and (iii) certain\nmembers of management and our board of directors. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of our\nClass B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore control the outcome of all matters submitted to our\nstockholders. This concentrated control limits or precludes the ability of holders of Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Future transfers\nof shares of our Class B common stock generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, with limited exceptions. The conversion of shares of\nour Class B common stock into our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of each remaining share of Class B common\nstock.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of Class A common stock by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nAs of November 20, 2024, we had outstanding a total of 46,963,255 shares of Class A common stock and 8,914,045 shares of Class B common stock that are convertible at any\ntime into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. The sale of shares of Class A common stock, or the perception of future sales by us or our existing stockholders,\ncould harm the prevailing market price of shares of Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell\nequity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We have in the past, and we may in the future, issue our securities in connection with offerings or\nacquisitions, and the number of shares issued or issuable thereafter could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Any such issuance\nwould result in dilution to holders of Class A common stock.\nSunTx, together with its principals and their respective affiliates and family members (collectively, the “SunTx Group”), controls us, and their interests may conflict with ours\nor yours in the future.\nAs of November 20, 2024, the SunTx Group beneficially owned approximately 1.0% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 79.0% of our outstanding Class\nB common stock, representing approximately 52.1% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and\neach share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, the SunTx Group has the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby\ncontrol our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any,\non our Class A common stock, our ability to incur or issue debt, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our\nentry into extraordinary transactions. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock\nas part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in\nrelated party transactions involving the SunTx Group and certain companies controlled by its members. As a result, the interests of the SunTx Group may not in all cases be aligned\nwith your interests.\nIn addition, the SunTx Group may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such\ntransactions might involve risks to you. For example, the SunTx Group could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating\nassets. SunTx is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of SunTx, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have\nany duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The SunTx Group also\nmay pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSo long as the SunTx Group continues to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, it will continue to be able to effectively control our\ndecisions, even if the number of shares of outstanding Class B common stock is limited in proportion to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Shares of our\nClass B common stock may be transferred to an unrelated third party if holders of a majority of the shares of our Class B common stock owned by SunTx and its affiliates consent\nto such transfer in writing in advance.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such\ndesignations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors\nmay determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we\nmight grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified\ntransactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware corporate law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our Company, which could adversely affect the price\nof our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control\nof our Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain\nprovisions that may make acquiring control of our Company difficult, including:\n• a dual class common stock structure, which currently provides the SunTx Group and the other holders of our Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome\nof matters requiring stockholder approval, so long as they continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, even if they own\nsignificantly less than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock;\n• a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n• provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n• limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n• the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\n• the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove\ndirectors or amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\n• the authority of our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these\nprovisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay for\nshares of our Class A common stock.\nOur governing documents designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which\ncould limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the\nState of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any: (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on\nour behalf; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) action asserting a claim\nagainst us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine,\nand that if any action specified above is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will\nbe deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court\nto enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (b) having service of process made upon such claiming party by service upon such claiming party’s counsel in the\nforeign action as agent for such claiming party. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, the federal district courts of the United States are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action\narising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). These provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively,\nif a court were to\n23\nTable of Contents\nfind these provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other\njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we are a “controlled company” under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the rules of the SEC, our stockholders do not have, and may never\nhave, certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nThe SunTx Group controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the listing standards of The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC and SEC rules. As a controlled company, we are not required to comply with certain provisions requiring that (i) a majority of our directors be independent, (ii)\nthe compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or (iii) nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. Because we\nintend to continue to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Our status as a\ncontrolled company could cause our Class A common stock to be less attractive to certain investors or otherwise reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation, if any, of the price of our Class A common\nstock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will\nbe at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects\nand other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, only appreciation of the price\nof our Class A common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs part of our enterprise risk management function, we have implemented processes to assess, identify and manage the material risks facing our company, including risks from\ncybersecurity threats. Our enterprise risk management function represents our overall risk management system. Our cybersecurity program is built upon recognized security\nframeworks. We believe that our processes provide us with a comprehensive assessment of potential cybersecurity threats. We conduct regular scans, penetration tests, and\nvulnerability assessments to identify any potential threats or vulnerabilities in our systems. Our processes to assess, identify and manage the material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats include the risks arising from threats associated with third-party service providers, including cloud-based platforms.\nWe have developed a cybersecurity incident response plan that provides a documented framework for handling cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple\nparts of the Company. Dedicated members of our information security team, led by our Senior Vice President, Information Technology and our Director of Information Security,\ncontinuously monitor threat intelligence feeds, handle vulnerability management and respond to incidents. In addition, we periodically perform simulations and drills at a technical\nlevel.\nInternally, we have a security awareness training platform that includes training to reinforce our information technology and security policies, standards and practices, and we\nrequire that our employees comply with these policies. The cybersecurity awareness training platform offers training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect our\nresources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests.\nFrom time to time, we engage third-party service providers to enhance our risk mitigation efforts. For instance, we have engaged an independent cybersecurity advisor to evaluate\nour cybersecurity controls and a cybersecurity firm to conduct continuous threat detection, response and remediation.\nTo date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, and we currently do\nnot expect that the risks from cybersecurity threats are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nHowever, as discussed more fully under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” cybersecurity attacks are continually evolving to become more sophisticated and, while we have invested in the\nprotection of our data and information technology to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident, our efforts may not be effective in preventing breakdowns or breaches in our\nsystems.\n24\nTable of Contents\nGovernance\nRole of the Board. Our board of directors exercises direct oversight of our strategic risks through its oversight of our enterprise risk management function. The Audit Committee of\nthe board of directors in particular is responsible for overseeing our IT security controls and the adequacy of our IT security program, compliance and controls with management.\nAs part of such oversight, the board of directors, including members of the Audit Committee, receive periodic reports from management and our third-party service providers to\nassess the primary cybersecurity risks we face.\nRole of Management. Our Senior Vice President, Information Technology and our Director of Information Security are together responsible for the day-to-day management of our\ncybersecurity risks. These professionals have extensive experience in the information technology area, including cybersecurity. In particular, our Senior Vice President, Information\nTechnology has more than 30 years of professional experience in the field of management information systems and information security, including with other companies in our\nindustry. Further, our Director of Information Security has more than 20 years of experience in the information security area, with a career spanning roles with the U.S. Air Force,\nhealthcare, academia and private consulting, and holds various certifications related to cybersecurity.\nSecurity Incident Response Plan. We have a security incident response plan in place. The incident response plan is a set of coordinated procedures that our incident response team\nexecutes with the goal of ensuring timely and accurate resolution of cybersecurity incidents.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive office is located in Dothan, Alabama, in a building that we own. As of November 20, 2024, we operated (i) 84 HMA plants in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, (ii) 17 aggregates facilities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Texas and (iii) three liquid asphalt terminals in Alabama,\nFlorida and Texas. Our HMA plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on market conditions. We maintain offices at our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and\nterminals as we determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. We consider our plants and other physical properties, whether owned or leased, to be suitable, adequate, and of\nsufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of our business. However, we routinely evaluate the purchase or lease of additional properties or the consolidation of our\nproperties as our business needs change.\nThe table below summarizes the locations and the nature of our ownership or leasehold interest in each of our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and liquid asphalt terminals as of\nNovember 20, 2024.\nHMA Plants Aggregates Facilities Liquid Asphalt Terminals\nLocation Owned Leased Owned Leased Owned Leased\nAlabama 8 6 6 3 1 —\nFlorida 10 2 1 — 1 —\nGeorgia 9 3 1 2 — —\nNorth Carolina 12 11 — — — —\nSouth Carolina 4 6 — — — —\nTennessee — 3 — — — —\nTexas 7 3 3 1 1 —\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, (i)\nworkers’ compensation claims, (ii) employment-related disputes and (iii) liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct claims in connection with the performance of\nservices and provision of materials. We and our affiliates are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance\nwith government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. In the opinion of our\nmanagement, after consultation with legal counsel, none of the pending inquiries, litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely to us, would have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nand Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R.

The actual number of beneficial holders of\nour Class A common stock is significantly greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held by banks,\nbrokers and other nominees. The last sale price for a share of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 20, 2024 was $91.31.\nAs of November 20, 2024, there were 8,914,045 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by 40 stockholders of record.\nDividends\nHolders of our Class A and Class B common stock receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. We do not anticipate declaring or\npaying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and\nwill depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors\nthat our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock unless, after giving\neffect to such dividend, we would remain in compliance with the financial covenants and, at the time any such dividend is made, no default or event of default exists or would result\nfrom the payment of such dividend.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThere were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the period covered by this report that were not previously reported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current\nReport on Form 8-K.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nApproximate dollar value of\nTotal number of shares shares that may yet be\nTotal number of Average price purchased as part of publicly purchased under the plans\nPeriod shares purchased paid per share announced plans or programs or programs (1)\nJuly 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 44,002 $ 57.62 44,002 $ 32,194,980\nAugust 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 36,331 $ 59.82 36,331 $ 30,021,791\nSeptember 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 — $ — — $ 30,021,791\nTotal 80,333 $ 58.60 80,333\n(1) In April 2024, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $40.0 million of our Class A common stock in open market purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions or by other means.

[Reserved]\n27\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our\nresults of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our\nplans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” This discussion\nshould be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In this discussion, we use certain non-\nGAAP financial measures. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in\nthis “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as\nsubstitutes for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the building and maintenance of transportation networks. Our operations leverage a highly-skilled workforce, strategically\nlocated HMA plants, substantial construction assets and select material deposits. We provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects,\nwith an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites throughout the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee and Texas.\nOur public projects are funded by federal, state and local governments and include roads, highways, bridges, airports and other forms of infrastructure. Public transportation\ninfrastructure projects historically have been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets and represent a significant share of the United States construction market.\nFederal funds are allocated on a state-by-state basis, and each state is required to match a portion of the federal funds that it receives. Federal highway spending uses funds\npredominantly from the Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from fuel taxes and other user fees.\nIn addition to public infrastructure projects, we provide a wide range of large site work construction and HMA paving services to private construction customers, including\ncommercial and residential developers and local businesses.\nRecent Developments\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion. Contract backlog is a financial measure that reflects the dollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in\nthe future. We include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Our backlog consists of uncompleted\nwork on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not commenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include\n(i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our\ncustomers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of\nuncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet begun was $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. Our contract backlog also includes low\nbid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private work projects for which we\nhave been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog was $0.5 billion at September\n30, 2024.\n2024 Fiscal Year Business Acquisitions\nDuring the 2024 fiscal year, we completed eight acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. As\na result of these acquisitions, we added eleven asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction professionals. For further discussion\nregarding these transactions, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nLone Star Paving Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt, Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving) (“Lone Star Paving” and the acquisition, the\n“Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas, with 10 HMA plants, four aggregate facilities, and one\nliquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone Star Acquisition consisted of (i) $654.2 million in cash (as\nadjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company, Lone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J.\nWheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 3.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, we agreed to (i) pay cash to the\nselling unit holders in\n28\nTable of Contents\nan amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at closing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification\nobligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in quarterly installments over four quarters following the closing, and (ii) purchase from the selling unit holders\nfor $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real property following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from\nthe proceeds of the Term Loan B (as defined below). For more information about the Lone Star Acquisition, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this report.\nTerm Loan B Credit Agreement\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA Securities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC,\nRegions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the\n“Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0\nmillion, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the\nconsideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan\nproceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below), (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other\ncorporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For more information about the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCredit Agreement Amendments\nIn May 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to\ntime, the “Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from $325.0 million to\n$400.0 million, (ii) reallocate $125.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the revolving credit facility to our term loan, (iii) add three new banks to our lender\nsyndicate, (iv) provide for an additional incremental credit facility of up to $200.0 million and (v) update certain affirmative and negative covenants thereunder. Additionally, on\nOctober 30, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star Acquisition, (ii) entry\ninto the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement on a pari passu basis\nwith the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. For further discussion regarding the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit\nAgreement and the foregoing amendments, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40 million is available to purchase shares of our outstanding Class A common\nstock through September 30, 2025. We utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our equity incentive plans and to repurchase\nshares opportunistically. Shares of our Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated\ntransactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any shares\nof Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number\nand value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased are determined by a committee of the board of directors at its discretion and depend on a number of factors, including the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we\nrepurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in\nparticular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and\noperations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in\nthe construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher\nactivity and revenues during the second half of our fiscal year. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our\nthird fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenues in the third fiscal\nquarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.\n29\nTable of Contents\nHow We Assess Performance of Our Business\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues predominantly by providing construction products and services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads,\nbridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States. Our projects represent a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. We also\nderive revenues from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement to customers. We recognize revenues derived from projects as we satisfy our performance obligations\nover time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost\ninput method). Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may\nresult in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates and\nliquid asphalt cement are recognized when the risks associated with ownership have passed to the customer.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists of all direct and indirect costs associated with construction contracts, including raw materials, labor,\nequipment costs, depreciation, lease expenses, subcontract costs and other expenses at our HMA plants, aggregates mining facilities and liquid asphalt cement terminal. Our cost of\nrevenues is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily liquid asphalt and diesel fuel. From time to time, when appropriate, we limit our exposure to changes in\ncommodity prices by entering into forward purchase commitments. In addition, our public infrastructure contracts often provide for price adjustments based on fluctuations in\ncertain commodity-related product costs. These price adjustment provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar provisions in\nour private contracts.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Accretion and Amortization\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements, intangible assets and liabilities.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term. Our intangible assets and liabilities were recognized as a result\nof certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities. Mineral reserves are depleted in accordance\nwith the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate offices.\nThese expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial\nemployees. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition expenses, audit, consulting and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, travel, insurance,\noffice space rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn the normal course of business, we sell construction equipment for various reasons, including when the cost of maintaining the asset exceeds the cost of replacing it. The gain or\nloss on the sale of property, plant and equipment reflects the difference between the carrying value at the date of disposal and the net consideration received from the sale of\nequipment during the period.\nGain on Facility Exchange\nAs part of our continued growth strategy, we may exchange or sell facilities in order to generate capital for use in connection with other strategic initiatives. The gain or loss on the\nexchange or sale of a facility reflects the difference between the net carrying value of the facility at the date of disposal and the consideration received from the exchange or sale\nduring the period.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net primarily represents interest incurred on our long-term debt, such as the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the changes in fair values of\ninterest swap agreements and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. These amounts are partially offset by interest income earned on short-term investments of cash balances\nin excess of our current operating needs.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOther Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before, as applicable from time to time, (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion,\naccretion and amortization, (iv) share-based compensation expense, (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, and (vi) expenses associated with non-routine acquisitions. Adjusted\nEBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither\nrequired by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net\nincome or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate\ncompanies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies.\nPotential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation\nof Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023 (2)\nNet income $ 68,935 $ 49,001\nInterest expense, net 19,071 17,346\nProvision for income taxes 23,161 16,403\nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization 92,920 79,100\nShare-based compensation expense 15,031 10,759\nAcquisition-related expenses (1) 1,455 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 220,573 $ 172,609\nRevenues $ 1,823,889 $ 1,563,548\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 12.1 % 11.0 %\n(1) Reflects expenses associated with the Lone Star Acquisition, which management views as a non-routine acquisition.\n(2) In periods commencing prior to September 30, 2023, we historically included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA an adjustment for management fees and expenses\nrelated to our management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx Capital Partners, a member of our control group. Effective October 1, 2023, the term of the\nmanagement services agreement was extended to October 1, 2028. As a result of the term extension, we no longer view the management fees and expenses paid under the\nmanagement services agreement as a non-recurring expense. Accordingly, periods commencing subsequent to September 30, 2023 do not include an adjustment for\nmanagement fees and expenses, and we have recast comparative Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to conform\nto the current definition.\n31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations — Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”) and September 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) (in thousands, except\npercentages).

Revenues for fiscal 2024 increased $260.3 million, or 16.7%, to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2023. The increase included $154.0 million of revenues\nattributable to acquisitions completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2023 and an increase of approximately $106.3 million of revenues in our existing markets from contract work\nand sales of HMA and aggregates to third parties. The 6.8% increase in revenue in our existing markets was due to strong demand in both public and private work.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2024 increased $61.9 million, or 31.5%, to $258.3 million from $196.4 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily the\nresult of the 16.7% increase in revenues for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and a higher gross profit margin. The higher gross profit margin was due to (i) efficient utilization of\nour plants and equipment fleet and (ii) completion of new backlog with more favorable margins.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 increased $24.6 million, or 19.3%, to $151.5 million from $126.9 million for fiscal\n2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was the result of (i) an $8.1 million increase attributable to general and\nadministrative expenses associated with the operations of businesses acquired subsequent to September 30, 2023, (ii) a $6.6 million increase in management personnel payroll and\nbenefits, (iii) a $4.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense, and (iv) a $5.6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment. Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2024 decreased $2.6 million, or 36.4%, to $4.5 million from $7.0 million\nfor fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a $1.3 million gain on the sale of an excess office building and higher disposals of equipment and components during fiscal\n2023.\nGain on Facility Exchange. There was no gain on facility exchange for fiscal 2024 compared to a gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million for fiscal 2023. The gain in fiscal 2023\nwas the result of the disposition of a quarry in North Carolina. In connection with\n32\nTable of Contents\nthis transaction, we acquired three HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in the Nashville, Tennessee metro area.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2024 increased $1.7 million, or 9.9%, to $19.1 million compared to $17.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in interest\nexpense, net was primarily due to an increase in the average principal debt balance outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.1% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\nNet Income. Net income increased $19.9 million, or 40.7%, to $68.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $49.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in net income was primarily a\nresult of higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense and decreased gains from the facility exchange and sales of\nproperty, plant and equipment, all as described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were $220.6 million and 12.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2024, compared to\n$172.6 million and 11.0%, respectively, for fiscal 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin resulted primarily from a $19.9 million increase in net\nincome and a $13.8 million increase in depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as well as a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see above under the heading “How We Assess Performance of Our Business — Other Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows Analysis\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions $ 209,079 $ 157,157\nNet cash used in investing activities (307,585) (143,372)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities 126,110 (264)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 27,604 $ 13,521\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $209.1 million, primarily as a result of:\n• net income of $68.9 million, reflecting, among other things, $92.9 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $22.7 million,\nshare-based compensation expense of $14.4 million, and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $4.5 million;\n• an increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $6.6 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\n• an increase in inventories of $15.5 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our\ninventory cycle;\n• an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13.0 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\n• an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $18.3 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\n• a net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on\nuncompleted contracts of $30.4 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\n33\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $157.2 million, primarily as a result of:\n• net income of $49.0 million, reflecting, among other things, $79.1 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $11.2 million,\nshare-based compensation expense of $10.8 million, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.0 million, and gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million;\n• an increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $26.0 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\n• an increase in inventories of $7.3 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our\ninventory cycle;\n• a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\n• an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $19.6 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\n• a net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on\nuncompleted contracts of $26.7 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash used in investing activities was $307.6 million, of which $231.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $87.9 million was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment and $5.5 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $14.1 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment\nand $3.6 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities was $143.4 million, of which $91.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $97.8 million was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment and $11.4 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $17.7 million of proceeds from the sale of\nequipment, $37.0 million of proceeds from the facility exchange and $2.9 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $126.1 million. We received $210.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs\nand discounts, which was partially offset by $72.8 million of principal payments on long-term debt and purchase of treasury stock of $11.3 million.\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million. We received $103.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and\ndiscounts, which was offset by $103.1 million of principal payments on long-term debt and the purchase of treasury stock of $0.2 million.\nTerm Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement\nDuring fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we and each of our subsidiaries were parties to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, which provides for the Term Loan A and the\nRevolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had $392.2 million and $283.8 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan A, $122.9\nmillion and $93.1 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $268.8 million and $222.1 million, respectively, under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit. The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility are\nsecured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nThe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum\nconsolidated leverage ratio of 3.50-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.15-to-1.00 and 2.56-to-1.00,\nrespectively, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.81-to-1.00 and 1.72-to-1.00, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional\nvalue of these interest rate swap agreements was $300.0 million, and the fair value was $11.6 million and $26.9 million, respectively, which is included within other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFor more information about the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this report.\nTerm Loan B Credit Agreement\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of\n$850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024. A portion of the proceeds of the Term B Loan was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the\nLone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be\nused (i) to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay fees and\nexpenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by\nthe Term Loan B Credit Agreement.\nFor more information about the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nDuring fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our capital expenditures were approximately $87.9 million and $97.8 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are typically made during\nthe same fiscal year in which they are approved. At September 30, 2024, our commitments for capital expenditures were not material to our financial condition or results of\noperations on a consolidated basis. For fiscal 2025, we expect total capital expenditures to be $130.0 million to $140.0 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is\nsubject to change.\nHistorically, we have required significant amounts of cash in order to make capital expenditures, purchase materials and fund our organic expansion into new markets. Our working\ncapital needs are driven by the seasonality and growth of our business, with our cash requirements increasing in periods of growth. Additional cash requirements resulting from our\ngrowth include the costs of additional personnel, production and distribution facilities, enhancements to our information systems, integration costs related to any acquisitions and\nour compliance with laws and rules applicable to public companies.\nFurthermore, on April 12, 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40.0 million is available to purchase shares of\nour outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We intend to utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under\nour equity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at\nprevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any\ntime by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased will be determined by a committee of the board of directors at\nits discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic\nconditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0\nmillion.\nWe have typically relied on cash available through credit facilities, in addition to cash from operations, to finance our working capital requirements and to support our growth. We\nregularly monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt markets, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. Our future success\nwill depend on our ability to access outside sources of capital.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the Term Loan B Credit Agreement (together, the\n“Credit Agreements”) will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number\nof variables, including the potential impacts of inflation and supply chain constraints, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to conduct our operations. Our\noperations and other capital resources may not provide sufficient cash to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event that we make one or more\nacquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount of cash on hand we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the\nexpected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through borrowings under the Credit Agreements, joint ventures,\nasset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. However, our ability to engage in any such transactions may be constrained by economic conditions and other\nfactors outside of our control. Additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need, we may not be able to complete\nacquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.3 million, future purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas of\n$4.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and $2.2 million of minimum royalty payments related to mineral leases at aggregates facilities. Other than the letters of credit, future\npurchase commitments and minimum royalty payments, we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current\nor future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\n2029 and\nTotal 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter\nDebt obligations $ 515,038 $ 26,563 $ 31,875 $ 456,600 $ — $ — $ —\nOperating leases 44,892 11,067 10,702 9,954 6,186 2,366 4,617\nPurchase commitments 4,457 3,193 1,264 — — — —\nRoyalty payments 2,243 256 192 180 145 145 1,325\nAsset retirement obligations 2,477 — — — — — 2,477\nTotal $ 569,107 $ 41,079 $ 44,033 $ 466,734 $ 6,331 $ 2,511 $ 8,419\nIn addition to the items set forth in the table above, subsequent to September 30, 2024 and in connection with the Lone Star Acquisition, we entered into a conditional purchase\nagreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase from the sellers of Lone Star Paving, upon the receipt of certain permits and governmental entitlements, an entity that owns\ncertain real property located in central Texas for aggregate consideration of $30.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates\nand assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that, in management’s view, are the most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. The notes to\nthe consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting\npolicies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level\nof estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are discussed further below.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a\ncontract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum\ncontracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Revenues from fixed unit price and fixed total price construction contracts are recognized as\nperformance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total\nestimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit\nbased on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these\ncontracts. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance,\nsuch as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting\nperiod when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job\nconditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs\nand income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract without adding new provisions or terms. Change orders may\ninclude changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our customers may\ninitiate change orders. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have a change of scope for which we believe we are contractually entitled to a\nhigher price, but where a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are\nincluded in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenues equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders\nwhen realization of price approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and\nrecoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers. Change orders that are unapproved as to both\nprice and scope are evaluated as claims. We consider claims to be amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our customers or others for customer-\ncaused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of\nunanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in the calculation of revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. To support these\nrequirements, the existence of the following items must be satisfied: (i) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim or a legal opinion has been obtained,\nstating that, under the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis to support the claim; (ii) additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and\nare not the result of deficiencies in our performance; (iii) costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work\nperformed; and (iv) the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable, not based on management’s subjective evaluation of the situation or on unsupported\nrepresentations. Revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized when an agreement is reached with the customer as to the value of the claim, which, in some\ninstances, may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated\nas project costs when incurred.\nFor the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment when projects are near completion or fully completed. The accuracy of our revenues and profit recognition in a given\nperiod depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts. Our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed\n“bottom up” approach. However, our projects can be highly complex and, in almost every case, the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some\nextent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid. Because we have a large number of projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity in process at any\ngiven time, these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability. However, large changes in revenues or cost estimates\ncan have a significant effect on profitability.\nThe accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our\nprojects use a detailed approach, and we believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in\nestimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include:\n• the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;\n• costs associated with scope changes;\n• changes in costs of labor and/or materials;\n• extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;\n37\nTable of Contents\n• subcontractor performance issues;\n• changes in productivity expectations;\n• site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n• changes from original design on design-build projects;\n• the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;\n• a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;\n• our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and\n• the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins, may cause fluctuations in gross profit between\nperiods, and these fluctuations may be significant.\nContracts Receivable, Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer and currently due in accordance with our contracts. Many of the contracts under which we perform work\ncontain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to amounts earned by the Company but held by customers until contracts are near completion or fully completed. Retainage on active\ncontracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. At September 30, 2024 and\n2023, contracts receivable included $52.7 million and $53.3 million, respectively, of retainage.\nBecause the majority of our construction contracts are entered into with federal, state or municipal government customers, credit risk is minimal. We confirm that funds have been\nappropriated by the government project owner prior to commencing work on such projects. While most of our public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the\ngovernment entity, in the event of any such termination, we are entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination-related costs. Credit risk\nwith private customers is minimized because of statutory mechanic’s liens, which give us high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private\ncustomers. We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which has historically been sufficient to cover accounts that are not collected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets, such as goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of\nuseful asset lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management, and this could have a material effect on our\noperating results and financial position. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a material impairment of our long-\nlived assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our most recent annual impairment test on July 1, 2024. Our test\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. For our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate our market capitalization compared to\nthe net assets of the Company overall. Our final determination of valuation is impacted by a number of factors, but the key factors are the price of our common stock, recently\ncompleted transactions from both public companies and private transactions and our estimated forecast of future cash flows.\nThe valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used. Our market capitalization could be impacted because we are a controlled company, which impacts the\ncontrol premium we apply to the market price of our common stock. One of the largest uncertainties relates to federal, state and local government spending, which management\nexpects to continue to increase in the coming years. There are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future\ncash flows, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report. Based on our valuation approaches, we determined that our one reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at July 1, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had goodwill\nwith a carrying amount of $231.7 million and $159.3 million, respectively.\nFor our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment,\nand it was determined that is more likely than not the indefinite-lived name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or\nperformed.\n38\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of\ninventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to\ncustomers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including\nasphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled\n$95.8 million and $75.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $10.9 million and $8.5 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly\nreview our deferred tax assets for recoverability and, where necessary, establish a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if we\ndetermine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nTo assess this likelihood, we use historical three-year results of operations, estimates and judgments regarding our future taxable income and consider the jurisdiction in which the\ntaxable income is generated to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, results of operations, actual and\nforecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain\ntax positions at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities\nin jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOn the basis of our evaluations, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, no valuation allowance was recorded on our net deferred tax assets, and we had no material uncertain tax\npositions. If our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material impacts on our\nearnings.\nAccrued Insurance Cost\nWe carry insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which we are liable to reimburse the\ninsurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, Construction Partners Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the Company, has retained the first $1,000,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. Also effective October 1, 2021, we became a member of a group captive\ninsurance company that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. We utilize various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims\nin excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect\non our operating results and financial position up to $1,000,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. Prior to October 1,\n2021, the amount for which we were liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims ranged from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence.\nManagement accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified, if\nnecessary, by recent events.\nWe provide employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company.\nUnder the self-insured policies, we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. We purchase separate stop-loss insurance, which\nlimits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000.\nShare-Based Payments and Other Equity Transactions\nOur equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. We account for awards issued under our equity incentive plan using a fair\nvalue-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is\ntypically the vesting period.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short- and long-term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions. We have SOFR-based floating rate\nborrowings under the Credit Agreements, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. From time to time, we use derivative\ninstruments as hedges against the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. We do not enter into such derivative instruments for speculative or trading\npurposes.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a total of $515.0 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. Holding other factors constant and absent the interest rate swap agreements\ndescribed above, a hypothetical 1% change in our borrowing rates would result in a $5.2 million change in our annual interest expense based on our variable rate debt outstanding\nat September 30, 2024. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding interest rate swap contract at September 30, 2024 was $300.0 million. The maturity date of this swap is\nJune 30, 2027, and the fair value of the outstanding swap contract was $11.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations, interest payments, and fair values associated with the Company’s debt instruments assuming the Company’s\nactual level of variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).\nFor the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, Fair\n2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Value\nDebt obligations\nTerm Loan A $ 26,563 $ 31,875 $ 333,750 $ — $ 392,188 $ 392,188\nRevolving Credit Facility — — 122,850 — 122,850 122,850\nInterest payments (1) 33,406 31,435 22,196 —\n(1) Represents projected interest payments using the Company’s September 2024 SOFR-based floating rate of 6.60%.\nSee also Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Investments in Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n40\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee of the board of directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,\nby communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – Revenue Recognized Over Time Under Uncompleted Long-Term Construction Contracts\nAs described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has recognized $2,496,230,000 of costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30,\n2024. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue derived from long-term construction contracts over time as the Company satisfies the\nsingle performance obligation for each construction contract. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation of each long-term construction project is estimated using\nthe input method, which is measured by the relationship of total costs incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost\ninput method). Recognition of revenue under uncompleted long-term construction contracts requires significant judgment by management, including measuring progress towards\ncompletion of the contract by estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete the performance obligation of a contract.\nWe have identified the revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts that were uncompleted at September 30, 2024 as a critical audit matter because of the significant\nassumptions management makes in determining the amount of revenue to recognize prior to completion of the performance obligation of a contract. Auditing management’s\njudgments related to measuring progress towards completion of the Company’s long-term construction contracts through estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete\nthe performance obligation of the long-term contracts involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort. Our audit procedures related to revenue recognized\nunder uncompleted long-term construction contracts included the following, among others:\n42\nTable of Contents\n• We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts and tested such controls for design and\nimplementation, as well as operating effectiveness, including management’s controls over the estimation of total contract costs to be incurred in order to complete the\nperformance obligation of uncompleted contracts.\n• We selected a sample of long-term construction contracts, and we performed the following:\n◦ Compared the current year costs incurred to prior year estimates of costs to complete, which involved comparing projects completed during the fiscal year with the\nestimates made as of the previous balance sheet date to evaluate management’s ability to accurately estimate costs to complete the performance obligation of its\nlong-term construction contracts.\n◦ Analyzed the estimated cost to complete and gross margins for uncompleted contracts by comparing the Company’s three-year historical average gross margins by\ncustomer type to the estimated margin for uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2024.\n◦ Inquired with individuals outside of the accounting function, including project management teams and individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation, to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimates of costs to complete and estimated gross margins on uncompleted contracts.\n• Compared the costs and estimated earnings during the month immediately subsequent to the fiscal year end to costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts\nat September 30, 2024,and, on a sample basis, inquired with individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the performance obligation in the contracts in order to\nobtain corroborating evidence regarding estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 25, 2024\n43\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Construction Partners, Inc., and its subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements, and our report dated November 25, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 25, 2024\n44\nTable of Contents\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in

(the “Company”) is a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across the Sunbelt in Alabama,\nFlorida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of products and services to both\npublic and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. The Company’s primary operations\nconsist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (“HMA”) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities,\nincluding the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining\naggregates, such as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt\ncement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nThe Company was formed in 2007 by SunTx Capital Partners (“SunTx”), a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas, as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth\nstrategy in the HMA paving and construction industry.\nManagement’s Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and\nthe disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for items such as recognition of revenues and cost of\nrevenues, investments, mineral reserves, goodwill and other intangible assets, business acquisitions, valuation of operating lease right-of-use assets, allowance for credit losses,\nvaluation allowances related to income taxes, accruals for potential liabilities related to lawsuits or insurance claims, asset retirement obligations, valuation of derivative\ninstruments and valuation of equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are continually evaluated based on historical information and actual experience; however, actual results\ncould differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid securities that are both readily convertible\nto known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents include\nsecurities with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit at several banks. From time\nto time, account balances have exceeded the maximum available federal deposit insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and\nregularly monitors its credit risk.\nRestricted Cash\nConstruction Partners Risk Management, Inc. (the “Captive”), a captive insurance company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides general liability, automobile\nliability and workers’ compensation insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries. Restricted cash represents cash held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the\npayment of casualty insurance claims. The Company had restricted cash of $2.0 million and $0.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of such amounts\nshown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (unaudited, in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 74,686 $ 48,243\nRestricted cash 1,998 837\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 76,684 $ 49,080\nRestricted Investments\nThe Company’s restricted investments consist of debt securities, which are held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims. The Company\ndetermines the classification of its securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified securities held by the\nCaptive as available-for-sale. As a result, these securities are carried at their fair value. Purchases and sales of debt securities are recorded on the trade date. Interest income on debt\nsecurities is recorded when earned using an effective yield method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.\nThese securities have been classified as non-current assets based on their respective maturity dates and the Company’s intent to reinvest sales proceeds into new restricted\ninvestments. The Company had restricted investments of $18.0 million and $15.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities quarterly to determine whether there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost due to credit losses or\nother factors. This evaluation process entails judgement by the Company, and considers factors including the issuer’s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic\nconditions, interest rate changes and changes in the rating of the security. When the Company has determined that it intends to sell, or that it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will be required to sell a security before it recovers its amortized cost basis above fair value, the individual security is written down to fair value, with a corresponding\ncharge to “Other income” within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the intent impairment criteria but for\nwhich the Company has determined that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss allowance is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount\nby which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no intent impairments or credit losses.\nContracts Receivable Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled, and amounts retained by customers. It is common\nin the Company’s industry for a small portion of either progress billings or the contract price, typically 10%, to be withheld by the customer until contracts are near completion or\nfully completed. Such amounts, defined as retainage, are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Based on the Company’s\nexperience with similar contracts in recent years, billings for such retainage balances are generally collected within one year of the completion of the project.\nContracts receivable including retainage, net is stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for uncollectible accounts\nthrough a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for credit losses based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts, type of service performed, current\neconomic conditions, historical losses and other information available to management. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts\nare written off through a charge to the allowance for credit losses and an adjustment to the contract receivable.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nBilling practices for the Company’s contracts are governed by the contract terms of each project based on (i) progress toward completion approved by the owner, (ii) achievement of\nmilestones or (iii) pre-agreed schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost input method. The Company records contract assets\nand contract liabilities to account for these differences in timing.\nThe contract asset, “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts”, arises when the Company recognizes revenues for services performed under its\nconstruction projects, but the Company is not yet entitled to bill the customer under the terms of the contract. Amounts billed to customers are excluded from this asset and reflected\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Included in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company\nseeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for (i) errors, (ii) changes in contract specifications or design, (iii) contract change orders in dispute, unapproved as to scope\nand price, or (iv) other customer-related causes of unanticipated\n50\nTable of Contents\nadditional contract costs (such as claims). Such amounts are recorded to the extent that the amount can be reasonably estimated and recovery is probable. Claims and unapproved\nchange orders made by the Company may involve negotiation and, in rare cases, litigation. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and revenues\nassociated with unapproved change orders and claims are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company did not recognize any material amounts associated with claims and unapproved change orders during the\nperiods presented.\nThe contract liability, “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”, represents the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer\nfor which the Company has been paid by the customer or for which the Company has billed the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue for future services reflected in\nthis account are recognized, and the liability is reduced, as the Company subsequently satisfies the performance obligation under the contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are typically resolved\nwithin one year and are not considered significant financing components.\nConcentration of Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contracts receivable including retainage. In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these\nreceivables on an ongoing basis. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses, due primarily to management’s assessment of customers’ credit ratings.\nThe Company principally deals with recurring customers, state and local governments and well-known local companies whose reputations are known to management. The\nCompany performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The Company generally has the ability to file\nliens against the property if payments are not made on a timely basis. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s contracts receivable including retainage,\nnet balance at September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nProjects performed for various departments of transportation accounted for 40.7%, 36.2% and 36.8% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Customers that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues during any of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are\npresented below:\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAlabama Department of Transportation * * 10.0%\nFlorida Department of Transportation 13.6% 10.7% *\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation * 10.5% 11.2%\n* Less than 10%\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of\ninventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to\ncustomers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including\nasphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled\n$95.8 million and $75.5 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $10.9 million and $8.5 million,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company derives a significant portion of revenues from contracts with its customers, predominantly by performing construction services for both public and private\ninfrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. These projects are performed for a mix of federal,\nstate, municipal and private customers. In addition, the Company generates revenues from the sale of construction materials, including HMA, aggregates, liquid asphalt and ready-\nmix concrete, to third-party public and private customers pursuant to contracts with those customers. The following table reflects, for the periods presented, (i) revenues generated\nfrom public infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers and (ii) revenues generated from private infrastructure construction\nprojects and the sale of construction materials to private customers.\n51\nTable of Contents\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nPublic 63.1% 63.0% 60.9%\nPrivate 36.9% 37.0% 39.1%\nRevenues derived from construction projects are recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of the asset created or enhanced\nby the project to the customer. Recognition of revenues for construction projects requires significant judgment by management, including, among other things, estimating total costs\nexpected to be incurred to complete a project and measuring progress toward completion. Management reviews contract estimates regularly to assess revisions of estimated costs to\ncomplete a project and for measurement of progress toward completion. No material adjustments to a contract were noted in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 or\n2022.\nManagement believes the Company maintains reasonable estimates based on prior experience; however, many factors contribute to changes in estimates of contract costs.\nAccordingly, estimates made with respect to uncompleted projects are subject to change as each project progresses and better estimates of contract costs become available. All\ncontract costs are recorded as incurred, and revisions to estimated total costs are reflected as soon as the obligation to perform is determined. Provisions are recognized for the full\namount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue, regardless of the\nstage of completion. When the Company incurs additional costs related to work performed by subcontractors, the Company may be able to utilize contractual provisions to back\ncharge the subcontractors for those costs. A reduction to costs related to back charges is recognized when estimated recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Contract costs consist of (i) direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and (ii) indirect costs related to contract\nperformance, such as insurance, employee benefits, and equipment (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs).\nProgress toward completion is estimated using the input method, measured by the relationship of total cost incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required\nto complete the project (cost-to-cost method). The Company believes this method best depicts the transfer of goods and services to the customer because it represents satisfaction of\nthe Company’s performance obligation under the contract, which occurs as the Company incurs costs. The Company measures percentage of completion based on the performance\nof a single performance obligation under its construction projects. Each of the Company’s construction contracts represents a single performance obligation to complete a defined\nconstruction project. This is because goods and services promised for delivery to a customer are not distinct, as the customer cannot benefit from any individual portion of the\nservices on its own. All deliverables under a contract are part of a project defined by a customer and represent a series of integrated goods and services that have the same pattern of\ndelivery to the customer and use the same measure of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the customer’s asset is created or enhanced by the Company.\nRevenue recognized during a reporting period is based on the cost-to-cost input method applied to the total transaction price, including adjustments for variable consideration, such\nas liquidated damages, penalties or bonuses, related to the timeliness or quality of project performance. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction\nprice at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled or the most likely amount the Company expects to incur, in the case of liquidated damages or penalties.\nSuch amounts are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the\nuncertainty is resolved. The Company accounts for changes to the estimated transaction price using a cumulative catch-up adjustment.\nThe majority of the Company’s public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, the Company commits to providing materials or services\nrequired by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). The Company’s private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also\nknown as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenue\nand cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from\ncontract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated revenues and costs and are recognized in the period in which the\nrevisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract and become part of the single performance obligation that is\npartially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. This is because goods and services promised under change orders are generally not distinct from the remaining goods and\nservices under the existing contract, due to the significant integration of services performed in the context of the contract. Accordingly, change orders are generally accounted for as\na modification of the existing contract and single performance obligation. The Company accounts for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Either the Company\nor its customers may initiate change orders, which may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of\ncompletion of the work.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRevenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, and liquid asphalt are recognized at a point in time, which is when control of the product is transferred to\nthe customer. Generally, that point in time is when the customer accepts delivery at its facility or receives product in its own transport vehicles from one of the Company’s HMA\nplants or aggregates facilities. Upon purchase, the Company generally provides an invoice or similar document detailing the goods transferred to the customer. The Company\ngenerally offers payment terms customary in the industry, which typically require payment ranging from point-of-sale to 30 days following purchase.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820,F air Value Measurements\n(“Topic 820”). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Inputs used to measure fair value are classified using the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable\nmarket data.\nLevel 3. Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs used in the\ndetermination of fair value are based on the best information available under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, contracts receivable including retainage, accounts payable and accrued expenses reflected\nas current assets and current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management\nconsiders their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has debt securities reflected as restricted investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. These investments are adjusted to fair\nvalue at each balance sheet date and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company also had a Term Loan A and a Revolving Credit Facility, each as defined and described in Note 11 - Debt. The carrying value of amounts\noutstanding under these credit facilities is reflected as long-term debt, net of current maturities and deferred debt issuance costs and current maturities of long-term debt on the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the variable rate or short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying\nvalue to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity and interest rate swaps are based on forward and spot prices, as described in Note 20 - Fair Value\nMeasurements.\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an\nexcess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts\ndetermined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital\nrequirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant\nassumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\nManagement applies fair value measurement guidance to its impairment analysis for tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired in connection with a business combination, at fair value, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements for operating leases are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.\nMineral reserves and mine development costs, including stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine, are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production\nmethod as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves. Routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset\nimprovements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:\nCategory Estimated Useful Life\nLand and improvements Land, unlimited; improvements, 15-25 years\nMineral reserves Based on depletion\nBuildings 5 - 39 years\nPlants 3 - 20 years\nConstruction equipment 3 - 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 - 10 years\nLeasehold improvements The shorter of 15 years or the remaining lease term\nManagement periodically assesses the estimated useful life over which assets are depreciated, depleted or amortized. If the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of\nproperty, plant and equipment, management will reduce the estimated useful life and depreciate, deplete or amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining\nuseful life.\nThe carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the period of disposal, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the same period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of such assets, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might cause management to perform impairment testing include, but are not\nlimited to, (i) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, (iii)\nan accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset, (iv) an operating or cash flow performance\ncombined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, and (v) an expectation that an asset\nwill be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If indicators of potential impairment are present, management performs a recoverability test\nand, if necessary, records an impairment loss. If the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset or asset group is\nless than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, measured as the amount required to reduce the\ncarrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with the best available information based on the hierarchy described under “Fair Value Measurements” above.\nFor example, the Company would first seek to identify quoted prices or other observable market data. If observable data is not available, management would apply the best\navailable information under the circumstances to a technique, such as a discounted cash flow model, to estimate fair value. Impairment analysis involves estimates and the use of\nassumptions in connection with judgments made in forecasting long-term estimated inflows and outflows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset, and\ndetermining the ultimate useful lives of assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions, which could materially impact the results of an\nimpairment assessment.\nSegment Reporting and Reporting Units\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company operated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Each of the\nCompany’s platform operating companies engages in essentially the same business, which consists primarily of infrastructure and road construction.\nManagement has determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This determination is based on rules\nprescribed by GAAP applied to the manner in which management operates the Company. In particular, management assessed the discrete financial information routinely reviewed\nby the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), its Chief Executive Officer, to monitor the Company’s operating performance and support decisions regarding\nallocation of resources to its operations. Specifically, performance is continuously monitored at the consolidated level and as necessary at the individual contract level to timely\nidentify deviations from expected results. Resource allocations are based on the capacity of the Company’s operating facilities to pursue new project opportunities, including\nreallocation of assets that are underutilized from time to time at a certain operating facility to another operating facility where additional resources might be required to fully meet\ndemand. Other factors further supporting this conclusion include substantial similarities throughout all of the Company’s operations with respect to services provided, type of\ncustomers, sourcing of materials and manufacturing and delivery methodologies.\nManagement further determined that, based on their economic similarities, the Company’s operating subsidiaries, representing components, should be aggregated into one reporting\nunit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. These legal entities represent acquisitions\nthat occurred over time pursuant to the Company’s strategic growth strategy. Each operating subsidiary is managed by its president, who has primary responsibility for the\n54\nTable of Contents\nrespective operating subsidiary. These presidents are directly accountable to the CODM and maintain regular contact with the CODM as a team to discuss operating activities,\nfinancial results, forecasts, and operating plans for the Company’s single operating segment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Other intangible assets consist of an\nindefinite-lived trade name license in connection with a business acquired, and finite-lived assets, including a non-compete agreement, customer relationships and construction\nbacklog, each acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances\ncontinue to support an indefinite useful life. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.\nAnnually, on the first day of the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter, management performs an analysis of the carrying value of goodwill at its reporting unit for potential impairment.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and\ncircumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine whether\nthere is any impairment. The Company may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with a qualitative assessment. Because the Company has only\none reporting unit, a market capitalization calculation can be performed as the first step of the quantitative assessment by comparing the book value of the Company’s stock\n(determined by reference to the Company’s stockholders’ equity) to the fair value of a share of the Company’s stock. If the fair value of the stock is greater than the book value of\nthe stock, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value is less than the book value, then the Company must take a second step to\ndetermine the impairment amount, as described below.\nThe second step requires comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value, typically using the multiple period discounting method under the\nincome approach and market approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model, which involves significant estimates and assumptions, including preparation of\nrevenues and profitability growth forecasts, selection of a discount rate, and selection of a terminal year multiple, to estimate fair value. The market approach could include\napplying a control premium to the market price of the Company’s common stock or utilizing guideline public company multiples. Management’s assessment of facts and\ncircumstances at each analysis date could cause these assumptions to change. If the fair value of the respective reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not\nconsidered to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down\ngoodwill in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using the market capitalization calculation for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and determined that the fair value of its\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of each goodwill impairment test date, which is July 1 of the\napplicable year. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nManagement also annually assesses the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The\nCompany performed a qualitative impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived trade name licenses. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was\ndetermined that more likely than not the indefinite-lived trade name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or\nperformed.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts directly associated with obtaining debt financing are capitalized upon the issuance of long-term debt and amortized over the term of the related debt agreement. Unamortized\namounts are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt liability. Loan issuance costs associated\nwith the Revolving Credit Facility are presented as a component of other assets. Loan issuance costs incurred in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility are amortized using\nthe straight-line method over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective tax bases.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which the temporary differences are expected to be\nreversed or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the\n55\nTable of Contents\nperiod that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or\na portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented on a net basis by taxing authority and classified as non-current\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of the Company’s tax positions that are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical\nmerits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and other expenses, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Provision for Income\nTaxes for further information regarding the Company’s federal and state income taxes.\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\nCompensation costs related to equity-classified share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on grant date fair value. Compensation cost for\ngraded-vesting awards is recognized ratably over the respective vesting periods.\nAccrued Insurance Costs\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which it is liable to\nreimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, the Captive has retained liability for the first $1,000,000 of each claim paid. Also since\nOctober 1, 2021, the Company has been a member of CIRCA, Limited, a group captive insurance company, that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid.\nThe Company utilizes various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by\nchanges in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on the Company’s operating results and financial position. Management\naccrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historical trends modified, if necessary, by\nrecent events.\nThe Company provides employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the\ninsurance company. Under the self-insured policies, the Company is liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. The Company\npurchases separate stop-loss insurance that limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000.\nIn addition to the retention items noted above, the Company’s insurance provider requires the Company to maintain a standby letter of credit. This letter of credit serves as a\nguarantee to pay the Company’s insurance provider the incurred claim costs attributable to general liability, workers’ compensation and automobile liability claims, up to the\namount stated in the standby letter of credit, in the event that these claims are not paid by the Company (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies).\nWarranties\nFor some contracts, the Company is required to furnish a warranty that is usually one year in length. Because of the nature of these contracts, including contract owner inspections\nof the work both during construction and prior to acceptance, the Company has not experienced significant warranty costs for these short-term warranties and, therefore, has not\nestablished an accrual of these costs. Certain contracts carry longer warranty periods, for which the Company has accrued an estimate of warranty costs. The warranty liability is\nestimated based on the Company’s experience with the specific type of construction work and was not significant as of September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net income per share attributable to\ncommon stockholders, but includes dilutive unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method.\nStripping Costs\nStripping costs are costs incurred for the removal of overburden or waste materials for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials that will be commercially produced.\n56\nTable of Contents\nStripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are capitalized and reported within property, plant and equipment, net in the Company’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, once the mine\nis no longer in the development stage. Pre-production stripping costs included in property, plant and equipment were $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as of September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nStripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs and are included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the\nstripping costs are incurred. The production phase of a mine is deemed to begin when saleable minerals are extracted, regardless of the level of production. However, the production\nphase does not commence with the removal of de minimis saleable mineral material that occurs in conjunction with the removal of overburden or waste material for the purpose of\nobtaining access to aggregate materials. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced for the fiscal years ended September 30,\n2024, 2023 and 2022 were $3.2 million, $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development\nand/or normal use of the underlying assets. The ARO is recognized at its estimated fair value in the period in which it is incurred. These obligations generally include the estimated\nnet future costs of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating mines and related mine sites, in accordance with federal, state, local regulatory and land lease agreement\nrequirements. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated\nuseful life of the related asset. The liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present\nvalue resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. If the ARO is settled for an amount\nother than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on settlement. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary,\nthe asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for accounting for reclamation obligations.\nTo determine the fair value of the AROs, the Company estimates the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation activities including a reasonable profit margin.\nThis cost is then increased for future estimated inflation based on the estimated years to complete and discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted,\nrisk-free rate. See Note 23 - Asset Retirement Obligations.\nRight of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nAt the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract conveys to the Company the right to\ncontrol the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. Leases are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (“Topic 842”).\nThe Company measures and records an operating lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The amount of the operating lease right-of-use asset consists of:\n(i) the amount of the initial measurement of the operating lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, and\n(iii) any initial direct costs incurred. The present value calculation may account for an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise the option. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are escalations in payments over the base lease term, which have been reflected in lease expense on a straight-line\nbasis for operating leases over the expected lease term. A portion of the Company’s lease contracts contain the option to extend or renew. The Company assesses these options for\nindividual leases in determining the initial measurement of the operating lease liability.\nThe Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) or leases to explore for or use\nminerals. Instead, for these types of leases, the Company recognizes lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company reports comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Comprehensive\nincome consists of two subsets: net income and other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI includes adjustments for changes in fair value of an interest rate swap contract derivative\nand available-for-sale restricted investments. For additional information about comprehensive income, see Note 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n57\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805,B usiness Combinations (“Topic 805”), which\nallocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, other than leases\nacquired in connection with business combinations, which are recorded based on Topic 842, and contract assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations,\nwhich are recorded based on ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company engages\nthird-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in the fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs\nassociated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Any such adjustments are the\nresult of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments\nare generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation,\namortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.\nNote 3 - Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company monitors all Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and other authoritative guidance. There are no\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Pending Adoption\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires enhanced disclosures related to\nsignificant segment expenses and a description of how the chief operating decision maker utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. The new standard\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of specific categories and\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and expands disclosures related to income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024 and is to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nNote 4 - Business Acquisitions\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries made the following business acquisitions:\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Hubbard Paving & Grading, Inc., an asphalt and paving company headquartered in Walhalla, South\nCarolina, for $3.0 million. This transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Upstate region of South Carolina.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company acquired three HMA plants and certain related assets from Reeves Construction Company for $18.3 million. This transaction added HMA\nplants in Concord, North Carolina and Rock Hill and McConnells, South Carolina.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of SJ&L General Contractor, LLC (“SJ&L”), an HMA and sitework\ncompany headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, for $57.1 million. This transaction expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Huntsville, Alabama metro area. In\nconnection with this acquisition, the Company issued awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (defined below) to a certain key former employee of SJ&L who became a\nconsultant to the Company consisting of 22,791 shares of restricted Class A common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.0 million. The Company also entered into\na five-year non-compete agreement with a key former employee of SJ&L who became an employee of the Company providing for cash payments totaling $1.9 million, payable in\nten equal payments on each six-month anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Littlefield Construction Company, a soil base, surface treatment and sitework company headquartered\nin Waycross, Georgia, for $6.5 million. This transaction expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Waycross, Georgia area.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired certain assets of Sunbelt Asphalt Surfaces, Inc. (“Sunbelt Asphalt”), an asphalt paving company headquartered in Auburn, Georgia, for\n$29.2 million. The transaction added an HMA plant and a greenfield plant site in northeastern Georgia. In connection with this acquisition, the Company issued awards under the\n2018 Equity Incentive Plan (defined below) to certain key former employees of Sunbelt Asphalt who became employees of the Company consisting of (i) 30,000 shares of\nrestricted Class A common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.5 million and (ii) performance stock awards representing a target of 30,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.5 million.\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Hudson Paving, Inc., an asphalt and paving company headquartered in Rockingham, North Carolina, for\n$19.1 million. This transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Sandhills region of North Carolina.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Robinson Paving Company, headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, for $59.5 million. This transaction\nadded three HMA plants and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in Columbus, Georgia and surrounding areas.\nOn September 10, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of John G. Walton Construction Company, Inc., headquartered in Mobile, Alabama, for $38.9 million.\nThis transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the greater Mobile and southwestern Alabama market area.\nCombined Acquisitions During the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024\nThe above-referenced acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with Topic 805. The Company consulted with independent third parties to assist in\nthe valuation process. Total consideration transferred for these eight acquisitions was $231.7 million as of September 30, 2024.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodologies described under Business Acquisitions in Note 2 -\nSignificant Accounting Policies. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the\naggregate amount of $71.0 million for these eight acquisitions, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled workforce and synergies\nexpected to result from the acquisitions.\nThe results of operations attributable to these acquisitions are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2024, from their respective acquisition dates forward. The Company records certain costs to effect acquisitions as they are incurred, which are reflected in general and\nadministrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the amounts of $1.5 million, $0.3 million, and $0.8 million for the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThere are certain acquisitions with provisional estimates that are subject to finalization due to the recent timing of the acquisitions, status of valuations and finalization of working-\ncapital agreements. These estimates are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the values presented below. The Company will finalize these amounts within 12\nmonths from the respective acquisition dates.\n59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the consideration for the aforementioned acquisitions and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 30,\n2024 (in thousands):\nJohn G.

The Company recognizes expense, net of estimated forfeitures,\nfor PSUs based on the forecasted achievement of Company performance metrics, multiplied by the fair value of the total number of shares of common stock that the Company\nanticipates will be issued based on such achievement.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company awarded PSUs representing a target of 113,044 shares and forecasted vesting of 84,783 shares of Class A common\nstock to certain members of Company management under the Equity Incentive Plan. The grants are classified as equity awards. The aggregate grant date fair value of these PSU\nawards was $5.5 million. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded compensation expense in connection with PSUs in the amount of\n$2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which is reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company forecasted 149,807 shares of Class A common stock underlying PSUs as unvested and approximately $3.9 million of unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to PSU awards, which will be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.1 years. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024,\n55,358 shares of Class A common stock underlying PSUs were vested and issued.\n71\nTable of Contents\nCash-Settled Restricted Stock Units - Liability Classified Awards\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 114,264 of cash-settled restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees of the Company under the Equity\nIncentive Plan, of which 5,352 shares were forfeited by employees. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur. The aggregate grant date fair value of these awards\nwas $5.1 million and the fair value at September 30, 2024 was $7.6 million. Compensation expense associated with these awards for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024,\n2023 and 2022 was $3.7 million, $0.0 million and $0.0 million, respectively, which is reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income. As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the liability for cash-settled RSUs was $3.7 million and $0.0 million, respectively, and is included in\naccrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities. At September 30, 2024, there was approximately $3.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense\nrelated to these awards, which will be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 3 years.\nThe grant date fair value of cash-settled RSU awards is based on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the number of RSUs awarded on the date of grant. The\nawards must be settled in cash and are accounted for as liability-type awards. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period with remeasurement at the end of each\nreporting period at fair value until settlement. The requisite service period is based on the vesting provisions of the awards, which generally occurs in four equal annual installments\nbeginning on the date of the first fiscal year-end after the grant date.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Construction Partners, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) became effective on May 13, 2021. The ESPP is intended to provide eligible employees of the Company\nan opportunity to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a discounted rate using funds withheld through payroll deductions. The total number of shares\noffered under the ESPP is 1,000,000. The first offering period under the ESPP commenced on July 1, 2023. Since that date, employees have purchased 47,349 shares under the\nESPP. Employer expense associated with the ESPP for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $0.6 million, $0.0 million, and $0.0 million, respectively, and\nis included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNote 15 - Provision for Income Taxes\nThe Company files a consolidated United States federal income tax return and income tax returns in various states. Management evaluated the Company’s tax positions based on\nappropriate provisions of applicable enacted tax laws and regulations and believes that they are supportable based on their specific technical merits and the facts and circumstances\nof the transactions.\nThe provision for income taxes (benefit) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrent\nU.S. Federal $ (2,124) $ 3,520 $ —\nState 2,604 1,718 949\nTotal current 480 5,238 949\nDeferred\nU.S. Federal 19,043 9,959 5,662\nState 3,638 1,206 304\nTotal deferred 22,681 11,165 5,966\nProvision for income taxes $ 23,161 $ 16,403 $ 6,915\nDifferences exist between income and expenses reported on the consolidated financial statements and those deducted for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting.T he\nCompany’s deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following temporary difference tax effects at September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n72\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets\nAmortization of finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,082 $ 1,022\nFederal net operating loss carryforward 4,099 —\nFederal interest limitation carryforward 6,198 1,254\nState net operating loss carryforward 3,160 1,177\nEmployee benefits 7,959 4,695\nOther 3,846 2,709\nTotal deferred tax assets 26,344 10,857\nDeferred tax liabilities\nAmortization of goodwill (11,860) (8,647)\nProperty, plant and equipment (66,216) (32,939)\nInterest rate swap contract (2,115) (6,343)\nOther (5) (49)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (80,196) (47,978)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (53,852) $ (37,121)\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 include gross deferred tax assets of $26.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively. In assessing the realization of\ndeferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax\nassets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of\ndeferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the\nweight of all evidence known and available as of the balance sheet date, management believes that these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future. To the\nextent that management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nIncome taxes payable have been reduced by fuel tax credits of $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining\namount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes was $164.9 million and $109.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) to amounts reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAsset: Deferred income taxes, net $ — $ —\nLiability: Deferred income taxes, net (53,852) (37,121)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (53,852) $ (37,121)\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19.5 million and $0.0 million, respectively, and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $65.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively. The state net operating loss credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts between the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2032 and 2043 or are indefinite.\nThe U.S. statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company was 21% during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022T. he following table reconciles\nincome taxes based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\n73\nTable of Contents\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nProvision for income tax at federal statutory rate $ 19,340 $ 13,735 $ 5,941\nState income taxes 2,817 2,222 569\nPermanent differences 983 348 353\nOther 21 98 52\nProvision for income taxes $ 23,161 $ 16,403 $ 6,915\nUncertain Tax Positions\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“Topic 740”), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position\ntaken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions in the United States. Tax audits, by their nature, are often complex. In the normal course of business, the Company is\nsubject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of\ntaxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of the calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, management determines\nwhether the benefits of the Company’s tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions\nthat are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. Such accruals require\nmanagement to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. The Company\nperformed an analysis of its tax positions and determined that no uncertain tax positions existed at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Accordingly, there was no liability for uncertain tax\npositions at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Based on the provisions of Topic 740, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Due to the\nutilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 through 2023 are subject to examination.\nVarious state income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 through 2023 are also subject to examination.\nNote 16 - Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who are at least1 8 years old and have more than six months of service. The Company makes\ndiscretionary employer contributions, subject to IRS safe harbor rules. Employer contributions charged to earnings during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\nwere $7.8 million, $6.8 million, and $5.5 million, respectively.\nNote 17 - Related Parties\nOn December 31, 2017, the Company sold an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary to an immediate family member of an executive officer of the Company (“Purchaser of\nSubsidiary”) in consideration for a note receivable in the amount of $1.0 million, which approximated the net book value of the disposed entity. At September 30, 2024,\n$0.1 million and $0.1 million was reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining\nbalances on this note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company also received a note from the disposed entity (“Disposed Entity”) on December 31, 2017 in the\namount of $1.0 million representing certain accounts payable of the disposed entity that were paid by the Company. At September 30, 2024, $0.1 million and $0.1 million was\nreflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable.\nRemaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made in periodic installments through fiscal year 2026.\nPrior to its acquisition by the Company, a current subsidiary of the Company advanced funds to an entity owned by an immediate family member of an officer of the Company in\nconnection with a land development project. The obligations of the borrower entity to repay the advances were guaranteed by a separate entity owned by the same family member of\nthe officer. Amounts outstanding under the advances did not bear interest and matured in full in March 2021. In March 2021, the subsidiary of the Company amended and restated\nthe terms of the repayment obligation, as a result of which the officer personally assumed the remaining balance of the obligation. No new amounts were advanced to the officer by\nthe Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof in connection with the transaction. Under the amended and restated terms, the officer executed a promissory note in favor of the\nCompany’s subsidiary in the principal amount of $0.8 million. The note bears simple interest at a rate of4 .0% and requires annual minimum payments of $0.1 million inclusive of\nprincipal and accrued interest, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due and payable in full on December 31, 2027. Amounts outstanding under the note are reflected\non the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets (“Land Development Project”).\n74\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, the Company conducts or has conducted business with the following related parties:\n• Entities owned by immediate family members of an executive officer of the Company perform subcontract work for a subsidiary of the Company, including trucking and\ngrading services (“Subcontracting Services”).\n• Since June 1, 2014, the Company has been a party to an access agreement with Island Pond Corporate Services, LLC, which provides a location for the Company to conduct\nbusiness development activities from time to time on a property owned by the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Island Pond”).\n• The Company is party to a management services agreement with SunTx, under which the Company pays SunTx $0.30 million per fiscal quarter and reimburses certain\ntravel and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with services rendered under the management services agreement.\nThe following table presents revenues earned and expenses incurred by the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and receivable and\naccounts payable balances at September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to transactions with the related parties described above (in thousands):\nRevenue Earned (Expense Incurred) Receivable (Payable)\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023\nPurchaser of Subsidiary $ — $ — $ — $ 207 $ 311\nDisposed Entity — — — 132 198\nLand Development Project — — — 548 632\nSubcontracting Services (7,142)(1) (8,627)(1) (8,655)(1) (239) (593)\nIsland Pond (400)(2) (340)(2) (320)(2) — —\nSunTx (2,002)(2) (1,486)(2) (1,451)(2) — —\n(1) Cost is reflected as cost of revenues on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n(2) Cost is reflected as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to inquiries or audits by taxing authorities arising from its operations, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course\nof business, such as income taxes and other types of taxes. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may not be resolved\nin the Company’s favor. The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Liabilities for loss contingencies\narising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be\nreasonably estimated. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations\non an individual basis, and management did not accrue any material loss contingencies for the periods presented. However, adverse outcomes in a significant number of such\nordinary course inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nLetters of Credit\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company has a total capacity of $400.0 million that may be used for a combination of cash borrowings and letter of credit issuances.

The majority of the Company’s short-term\nleases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at periodic rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for\nconvenience provision.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average remaining term of the Company’s operating leases was5 .0 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 5.62%. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the lease liability was equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate on the Company’s secured\ndebt using a single maturity discount rate, as such rate is not materially different from the discount rate applied to each of the leases in the portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s undiscounted operating lease liabilities outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):\n76\nTable of Contents\nFiscal Year Amount\n2025 $ 11,067\n2026 10,702\n2027 9,954\n2028 6,186\n2029 2,366\nThereafter 4,617\nTotal future minimum lease payments $ 44,892\nLess: imputed interest 5,166\nTotal $ 39,726\nNote 20 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 under Topic 820 (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nSeptember 30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps $ — $ 11,646 $ —\nCorporate debt securities — 6,872 —\nU.S. government securities — 8,338 —\nMunicipal government securities — 1,598 —\nOther debt securities — 1,212 —\nTotal Assets $ — $ 29,666 $ —\nFair Value Measurement at Reporting Date Using\nSeptember 30, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets:\nCommodity swap contracts $ — $ 204 $ —\nInterest rate swaps — 26,909 —\nCorporate debt securities — 5,605 —\nU.S. government securities — 6,549 —\nMunicipal government securities — 1,748 —\nOther debt securities — 1,177 —\nTotal Assets $ — $ 42,192 $ —\nLiabilities:\nCommodity swap contracts $ — $ 20 $ —\nTotal Liabilities $ — $ 20 $ —\nThe fair value of interest rate swap contracts is based on a model-driven valuation using the observable components (e.g., interest rates), which are observable at commonly quoted\nintervals for the full term of the contracts. The fair value of the Company’s commodity swap contracts is based on an analysis of the expected cash flow of the contract in\ncombination with observable forward price inputs obtained from a third-party pricing source. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk. Therefore, the Company’s derivative\nassets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivative assets are included within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Other assets” on\nthe Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative liabilities are\n77\nTable of Contents\nincluded within “Accrued expense and other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt securities primarily consist\nof corporate bonds and U.S. Government and agency obligations. The fair value of these investments is determined based on market quotes. These investments are included within\n“Restricted Investments” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 21 - Investment in Derivative Instruments\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts\nThe Company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage its exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company regularly\nmonitors the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to its derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for\nspeculative purposes.\nThe Company records derivatives at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as one of the following: (i) a hedge of a\nforecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid (“cash flow hedge”) or (ii) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value hedge”).\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects\nearnings.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the\nhedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.\nIf the Company does not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above, changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivative instrument are reported in current period\nearnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows, while cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity.\nIf the Company determines that it qualifies for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging\nactivities, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as\ncash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions and linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company performs an initial prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness on a quantitative basis between the inception date and the earlier of the first quarterly hedge\neffectiveness date or the issuance of the financial statements that include the hedged transaction. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of designated hedges\nin offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using a qualitative assessment. The Company would discontinue hedge accounting\nprospectively when the derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable or the hedging instrument expires, is sold,\nterminated or exercised.\nCommodity Swap Contracts\nThe Company’s operations expose it to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. As part of its risk management process, the Company began\nentering into commodity swap transactions through regulated commodity exchanges. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nChanges in fair value of commodity swaps are recognized in earnings.\nThe following table represents the approximate amount of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and changes in fair value recognized in earnings on commodity derivative contracts\nfor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the fair value of these derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n78\nTable of Contents\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nChange in Change in Change in\nRealized Unrealized Total Gain Realized Unrealized Gain Total Gain Realized Unrealized Total Gain\nGain (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss) (Loss) Gain (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss)\nCost of revenues $ (61) $ (184) $ (245) $ (2,255) $ (342) $ (2,597) $ 3,472 $ (1,286) $ 2,186\nInterest expense, net 10,630 — 10,630 8,297 — 8,297 (806) 1,668 862\nTotal $ 10,569 $ (184) $ 10,385 $ 6,042 $ (342) $ 5,700 $ 2,666 $ 382 $ 3,048\nSeptember 30,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2024 2023\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets - commodity swaps(2) $ — $ 204\nOther assets - interest rate swap (1) 11,646 26,909\nAccrued expense and other current liabilities - commodity swaps(2) — (20)\nNet unrealized gain position $ 11,646 $ 27,093\n(1) Represents designated cash flow hedge of $11.6 million and $26.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Represents derivatives not designated as hedges.\nNote 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of two subsets: net income and OCI. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the accompanying Consolidated\nStatements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity, net of applicable taxes.

The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of\n$850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”).

(the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended: our Class A common stock, $0.001 par value (“Class A common stock”).\nDescription of Capital Stock\nThe following is a description of the material terms of our capital stock. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended and restated from time to time, the\n“Bylaws”), and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”). Copies of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws have been filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nUnder our Certificate of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of:\n• 400,000,000 shares of Class A common stock;\n• 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.001 par value (“Class B common stock”); and\n• 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 43,819,102 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, 8,861,698 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and no shares of\nundesignated preferred stock issued or outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had reserved 1,241,710 additional shares of Class A common stock and 2,000,000 shares of\nClass B common stock for issuance under our various stock and compensation incentive plans. Unless our board of directors determines otherwise, we will issue all shares of\nour capital stock in uncertificated form.\nClass A Common Stock\nDividend Rights\nThe holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate if, as and when declared by our board of directors, out of our legally available\nassets, in cash, property, shares of our common stock or other securities, after the payment of dividends required to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. The holders of Class\nA common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, unless\notherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws. The holders of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election\nof directors.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or upon a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, the assets legally available for distribution to our\nstockholders will be distributable ratably among the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock treated as a single class, subject to the prior satisfaction of all\noutstanding debts and other liabilities and the preferential rights and liquidation preferences to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nModification of Rights\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will not amend, alter, repeal or waive certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, or adopt any provision\ninconsistent therewith or effect any reclassification of the shares of Class A common stock, unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote or written consent of the\nholders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the holders of Class A\ncommon stock will have no right to vote thereon. However, this provision is subject to any other vote required by applicable law, and under Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL,\nholders of Class A common stock would be entitled to vote as a class upon a proposed action, whether or not entitled to vote by the Certificate of Incorporation, if such action\nwould increase or decrease the par value of Class A common stock, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights thereof so as to affect them adversely.\nOther Matters\nThe holders of Class A common stock have no sinking fund or redemption provisions, or conversion or preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of Class A common\nstock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Class A common stock is not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock.\nExchange Listing\nThe Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “ROAD.”\nPreferred Stock\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock. Unless required by law or by any rules adopted by\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, these authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors is\nable to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock, the terms and rights of such series, including dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, terms of\nredemption, liquidation rights and any other relative rights, powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of such series.\nWe could issue a series of preferred stock that, depending on its terms, may impede or discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority,\nof our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which they might receive a premium over the market price for their shares of Class A common stock.\nAdditionally, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of Class A common stock by restricting dividends on Class A common stock, diluting the voting\npower of Class A common stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of Class A common stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could\nhave an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company contain certain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nDual Class Structure\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides for a dual class structure, under which each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share and each share of our\nClass B common stock has ten votes per share.\nAuthorized but Unissued Capital Stock\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and preferred stock that are unissued and unreserved.\nClassified Board\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws classify the Board of Directors into three classes of directors as nearly equal in number as possible, each of which will\nserve for three years, with one class of directors being elected each year.\nRemoval of Directors; Vacancies\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all then-\noutstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; provided, however, that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding,\ndirectors may only be removed for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled\nto vote thereon, voting together as a single class. In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock\nthen outstanding, if any, any vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum,\nby a sole remaining director or by the stockholders; provided, however, that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, any newly created directorship on\nour board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of the\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and not by stockholders.\nSpecial Meetings\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the board of directors, Chief\nExecutive Officer, the board of directors or at the request of the holders of 25% of the Class B common stock. The Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special\nmeeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.\nAdvance Notice Requirement\nThe Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than\nnominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof. In order for any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will\nhave to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received at our principal\nexecutive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The Bylaws also\nspecify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. The Bylaws allow the chairman of the meeting at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and\nregulations for the conduct of meetings that may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if such rules and regulations are not followed.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Certificate of Incorporation contains provides that we may not engage in certain “business combinations” with any “interested stockholder” for a three-year period\nfollowing the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n• prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested\nstockholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, such stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting\nstock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n• at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our\noutstanding voting stock that is not owned by such stockholder.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nThe Certificate of Incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting.\nLimitation of Liability of Directors and Officers\nThe Certificate of Incorporation generally provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, no director or officer shall be liable to the Company or its\nstockholders for monetary damages for breach of certain fiduciary duties as a director or officer. Under the DGCL, a director’s liability may not be eliminated:\n• for any breach(es) of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or to our stockholders;\n• for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n• for certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions or repurchases; and\n• for any transaction from which the director or officer derives an improper personal benefit.\nThe effect of this provision is to restrict the rights of the Company and its stockholders to recover monetary damages against a director or officer for breach of certain\nfiduciary duties as a director.\nSupermajority Voting\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend, change, add to, rescind or repeal, in\nwhole or in part, the Bylaws without a stockholder vote in any matter. For as long as shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, any alteration, amendment,\nchange, addition, rescission or repeal of the Bylaws by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of our stock present\nin person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such alteration, amendment, change, addition, rescission or repeal. Once no shares of our Class B common stock\nremain outstanding, any alteration, amendment, change, addition, rescission or repeal of the Bylaws by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\n66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation\nmay be altered, amended, changed, added to, rescinded or repealed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding\nshares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nExclusive Forum Clause\nThe Bylaws contain a forum selection clause that provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district\ncourts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nExhibit 19.1\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nPOLICY PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING\nAND UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS\nThis policy supersedes all previous insider trading policies adopted by our board of directors.\nIntroduction\nFederal and state securities laws generally prohibit any person who is aware of material nonpublic information about a company from trading in securities of that company.\nThese laws also prohibit such person from disclosing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information.\nOur board of directors has adopted this policy to promote compliance with these laws and to protect you and our company from the serious liabilities and penalties that can\nresult from violations of these laws.\nIt is your responsibility to comply with the securities laws and this policy.

These transactions are discussed in this policy under the\nheading “Exceptions to this policy for certain transactions under Company benefit plans.” In addition, trading in Company securities is not prohibited by this policy if the trades\nare conducted pursuant to a prearranged trading plan that meets certain conditions. These types of plans are discussed in this policy under the heading “Exceptions to this policy\nfor trades pursuant to prearranged trading plans.”\nDefinition of material nonpublic information\nMaterial information. Information about our company is “material” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder or investor would consider it important in\nmaking a decision to buy, sell or hold our securities, or if the disclosure of the information would be expected to significantly alter the total mix of the information in the\nmarketplace about us. In simple terms, material information is any type of information that could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of our securities. Both\npositive and negative information may be material. Information that could be material about our company includes:\n• earnings estimates (including changes of previously announced estimates)\n• a significant change in our operations, projections or strategic plans\n• a potential merger or acquisition\n• a potential sale of significant assets or subsidiaries\n• the gain or loss of a major supplier or customer\n• a new product or discovery\n• a significant pricing change in our products or services\n• a declaration of a stock split, a public or private securities offering by us or a change in our dividend policies or amounts\n• a change in senior management\n• an actual or threatened major lawsuit\nNonpublic information. Nonpublic information is information that is not generally available to the investing public. If you are aware of material nonpublic information, you\nmay not trade until the information has been widely disclosed to the public (for example, through a press release or a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”)) and the market has had sufficient time to absorb the information. For purposes of this policy, information will generally be considered public after the second full\ntrading day following the Company’s public release of the information. For example, if we issued a press release on a Tuesday, the first day that trading could occur would be\non Friday.\nIf you are not sure whether information is material or nonpublic, consult with the Compliance Officer for guidance before engaging in any transaction in Company securities.\nUnauthorized disclosure of information\nYou are prohibited from disclosing to anyone inside or outside the Company any nonpublic information obtained at or through the Company, except when such disclosure is\npart of your regular duties and is needed to enable the Company to carry out its business properly and effectively.\nWe are subject to laws that govern the timing of our disclosures of material information to the public and others. Our Disclosure Policy provides that only certain designated\nemployees may discuss the Company with the news media, securities analysts and investors. All inquiries from outsiders regarding material nonpublic information about the\nCompany should be forwarded to our Chairman of the Board. Accordingly, when an inquiry is made by an outsider, the following response will generally be appropriate:\n“As to these types of matters, the Company’s spokesperson is Ned Fleming, our Chairman of the Board. If there is any comment, he would be the one to contact.”\nThe following procedures are appropriate in protecting the confidentiality of Company information: (i) avoid discussions of confidential matters in places where they might be\noverheard or otherwise disseminated; (ii) mark sensitive documents “confidential” and use sealed envelopes marked “confidential”; (iii) secure confidential documents and\nrestrict the copying of sensitive documents; (iv) provide instructions to receptionists regarding outside inquiries; (v) use code names for sensitive projects; (vi) use passwords to\nrestrict computer access; and (vii) do not use any Internet “chat rooms,” message boards, social networking websites or similar medium available to the public to post any\nunauthorized messages regarding the Company or our business, financial condition, employees, clients or other matters related to us.\nConsequences of violating insider trading laws or this policy\nThe consequences of violating the securities laws or this policy can be severe. They include the following:\nCivil and criminal penalties. If you violate the insider trading or tipping laws, you may be required to\n• pay civil penalties up to three times the profit made or loss avoided\n• pay a criminal penalty of up to $5 million\n• serve a jail term of up to 20 years\nIn addition, the Company and/or the supervisors of a person who violates these laws may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties if they did not take appropriate steps to\nprevent illegal trading.\nCompany discipline. If you violate this policy or insider trading or tipping laws, you may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including termination for\ncause. A violation of our Company policy is not necessarily the same as a violation of law and we may determine that specific conduct violates our policy, whether or not the\nconduct also violates the law. We are not required to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against an alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\nReporting of violations. Any employee, officer or director who violates this policy or any federal or state laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such\nviolation by any other employee, officer or director, must report the violation immediately to the Compliance Officer.\nExceptions to this policy for certain transactions under Company benefit plans\nCertain transactions in Company securities under Company benefit plans are not prohibited by this policy. These are:\nStock option or other equity awards exercises. This policy does not apply to your exercise of an employee stock option or other equity awards. It also does not apply to your\nelection to have the Company withhold shares\nsubject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. This policy does apply, however, to sales of shares received upon exercise of an option, including any broker-\nassisted cashless exercise of an option.\nException to this policy for trades pursuant to prearranged trading plans\nThe trading restrictions in this policy do not apply to trading in Company securities if the trades occur pursuant to a prearranged trading plan that has been precleared\nby our Compliance Officer. An SEC rule, Rule 10b5-1(c), provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability for trades that occur pursuant to a prearranged “trading\nplan” that meets certain specified conditions. You must enter into the trading plan at a time when you were not aware of any material nonpublic information. In addition, the\nestablishment and operation of the trading plan, as well as any modification or termination of the plan prior to its scheduled expiration date, must (a) comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) and any Company policies or guidelines concerning such plans, and (b) be precleared by the Compliance Officer. In preclearing the\nestablishment, operation, modification or termination of a trading plan, neither the Company nor the Compliance Officer will be responsible for determining whether the plan is\nin compliance with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1(c). Compliance with Rule 10b5-1(c) is solely your responsibility.\nCompany Assistance\nIf you have a question about this policy or whether it applies to a particular transaction, contact our Compliance Officer for additional guidance. The Compliance Officer is the\nCompany’s Senior Vice President, Legal, (334) 673-9763.\nExhibit 19.2\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL POLICY CONCERNING TRADING IN COMPANY SECURITIES\nBY CERTAIN DESIGNATED PERSONS\nThis policy supplements our Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others. This policy applies to certain designated\npersons. If you are subject to this policy, we will notify you and provide you with a copy of this policy. After you have read this policy, please sign the Certification that is\nattached to this policy and return it to the Compliance Officer. You will also be asked to recertify your compliance with this policy annually.\nPersons subject to this supplemental policy\nThis supplemental policy applies to:\n• each director of Construction Partners, Inc. (the “Company”);\n• each officer of the Company who has been designated by our board of directors as an “executive officer” for purposes of the reporting requirements and trading\nrestrictions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”); and\n• any additional persons that the Company may from time to time designate as being subject to this policy because of their position with the Company and access to\nmaterial nonpublic information.\nWe will notify you if you are subject to this supplemental policy. We refer to persons subject to this supplemental policy as “Designated Persons.”\nIf you are a Designated Person, then this policy also applies to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives with you and any other person or\nentity whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are subject to your control. You are responsible for making sure that these other persons and entities\ncomply with this policy.\nAdditional trading restrictions that apply to Designated Persons\nIf you are a Designated Person, you are subject to all of the requirements of our Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to\nOthers. In addition, you are subject to the following restrictions:\n• You may not trade in Company securities outside of a trading window. For purposes of this policy, a “trading window” will commence after the close of trading two\nfull trading days following the Company’s widespread public release of quarterly operating results and end after the close of trading on the tenth calendar day prior to the\nend of the fiscal quarter (or, if such tenth day is not a trading day, after the close of trading on the immediately preceding trading day).\n• Even during a trading window, you may not trade during a blackout period. You may not trade in Company securities during any special blackout periods that the\nCompliance Officer may designate with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chief Financial Officer if the Chief Executive Officer is\nunavailable). You may not disclose to any outside third party that a special blackout period has been designated.\n• You may not trade during a trading window without prior approval. During a trading window, you may trade in Company securities only after obtaining the\napproval of the Compliance Officer. If you decide to engage in a transaction involving Company securities during a trading window, you must notify the Compliance\nOfficer in writing of the amount and nature of the proposed trade(s) at least two business days prior to the proposed transaction, and certify in writing that you are not in\npossession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company. You must not engage in the transaction unless and until the Compliance Officer provides his\napproval in writing. Any determination by the Compliance Officer to disapprove a proposed trade will require the concurrence of the Chief Executive Officer (or if the\nChief Executive Officer is unavailable, the Audit Committee or the Chief Financial Officer). The foregoing functions of the Compliance Officer will be undertaken by\nthe Chief Executive Officer in the case of proposed trades by the Compliance Officer. Proposed trades by the Chief Executive Officer will require approval by any of (i)\nthe Compliance Officer, (ii) the Chief Financial Officer or (iii) the Audit Committee of the Board. The existence of these approval procedures does not in any way\nobligate the Compliance Officer to approve any transaction.\n• Except as permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), you may not trade in Company equity securities during a pension\nplan blackout period. If you are an executive officer or director, you may not trade or transfer during any pension fund blackout period any equity security of the\nCompany that you acquired in connection with your service as an officer or director, except to the extent such trade or transfer is permitted by SEC rules. A pension plan\nblackout period is generally any period of more than three consecutive business days under an individual account plan during which purchases or sales of Company\nequity securities are prohibited under the plan (whether by us or a fiduciary of the plan), excluding certain regularly scheduled blackouts and blackouts imposed solely in\nconnection with certain corporate transactions such as mergers. Any profits made by you in violation of this proscription are recoverable by us. We will notify plan\nparticipants, directors, officers and the SEC in advance of any pension plan blackout period.\n• You may not trade in puts or calls or engage in short sales with respect to Company securities. Trading in “puts” and “calls” (publicly traded options to sell or buy\nstock) and engaging in short sales are often perceived as involving insider trading and they may focus your attention on the Company’s short-term performance rather\nthan its long-term objectives. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. Therefore, transactions in puts,\ncalls and other derivative securities with respect to Company securities on an exchange or in any other organized market are prohibited by this policy, as are short sales of\nCompany securities.\n• You may not hold Company securities in a margin account, and you may not, without prior approval, pledge Company securities as collateral for any other\nloan. Because a broker is permitted to sell securities in a margin account if the customer fails to meet a margin call, the securities can be sold at a time when the customer\nis aware of material nonpublic information about the Company. Also, a foreclosure sale under any other loan could also occur at a time when the borrower has nonpublic\ninformation about us. Therefore, you may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. An exception to this\nprohibition may be granted in the case of a non-margin loan where you are able to clearly demonstrate the financial ability to repay the loan without resorting to the\npledged securities. A request for any such exception must be made to the Compliance Officer at least 10 days in advance of entering into the pledge agreement.\nExceptions to this Policy\nThe trading restrictions in this supplemental policy do not apply to those transactions under Company benefit plans that are not subject to the Policy Prohibiting Insider\nTrading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others. Those transactions are discussed in that policy under the heading “Exceptions to this policy for certain\ntransactions under Company benefit plans.” The trading restrictions in this supplemental policy also do not apply to trades pursuant to an approved pre-arranged trading plan\nprovided that you enter into the plan during a trading window and the plan otherwise meets the conditions for such plans set forth in the Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and\nUnauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others.\nIn addition, specific exceptions to this policy may be made when the person requesting approval does not possess material non-public information, personal\ncircumstances warrant the exception and the exception would not otherwise contravene the law or the purposes of this policy. Any request for an exception should be directed to\nthe Compliance Officer.\nInformation about the Compliance Officer\nWe have designated the Company’s Senior Vice President, Legal as the Compliance Officer for this policy. His telephone number is (334) 673-9763. If you have any\nquestions about this policy, you should contact the Compliance Officer.\nExhibit 21.1\nConstruction Partners, Inc.\nList of Subsidiaries\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of Incorporation/Formation Other Trade Names\nC.W.

The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion,\nmay determine whether Continuous Service will be considered interrupted in the case of any approved leave of absence, including sick leave, military leave or any other\npersonal or family leave of absence.\n(a) Forfeiture of Unvested Shares. If Unvested Shares do not become vested on or before the expiration of the period during which the applicable vesting\nconditions must occur, such Unvested Shares will be automatically forfeited and cancelled as outstanding shares of Stock immediately on the occurrence of the event or\nperiod after which such Unvested Shares may no longer become vested.\n(b) Restriction on Transfer of Unvested Shares.

The Company will hold all of the Unvested Shares in its custody until they become vested, at which time such vested Restricted Shares\nwill no longer constitute Unvested Shares. If requested by the Company, the Participant shall execute and deliver to the Company, concurrently with the execution of this\nAgreement (or, if requested by the Company, from time to time thereafter during the Restricted Period) blank stock powers for use in connection with the transfer to the\nCompany or its designee of Unvested Shares that do not become vested. On the lapse of the forfeiture conditions and non-transferability restrictions thereon the Company will\nrelease the shares of Stock that become vested to the Participant.\n5.

In addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any compensation paid to\nthe Participant by the Company, the Participant may provide for payment of withholding taxes in full by cash or check or, if the Committee permits, by one or more of\nthe alternative methods of payment set forth in the Plan.\n(b) The Participant may elect, within 30 days of the Date of Grant, to make a Section 83(b) Election include in gross income for federal income tax purposes, an\namount equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant of the Restricted Shares, less the amount paid, if any, by the Participant (other than in the form of\nservices) for the Restricted Shares. In connection with any such election, the Participant must promptly provide the Company with a copy of the election as filed with the\nInternal Revenue Service and pay to the Company, or make such other arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to pay to the Company based on the Fair Market\nValue of the Restricted Shares on the Date of Grant, any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares at the time of\nthe election.

Business\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee and Texas. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we provide a variety of products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on\nhighways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and residential developments. Consistent with our vertical integration strategy, our primary operations consist of (i)\nmanufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (“HMA”) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities, including the\nconstruction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining aggregates,\nsuch as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt cement for both\ninternal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nConstruction Partners, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation in 2007 as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth strategy in the HMA paving and construction\nindustry.\nAs used in this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Construction Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except when the context requires that those terms mean\nonly the parent company or a particular subsidiary.\nRecent Developments\n• ROAD-Map 2027. In October 2023, we publicly announced “ROAD-Map 2027,” a comprehensive business plan setting forth our strategic initiatives, growth priorities, and\nbusiness outlook through fiscal year 2027. ROAD-Map 2027 contemplates several revenue and growth goals, including, among others, revenues exceeding $3 billion by the\nend of fiscal year 2027.\n• 2024 Fiscal Year Acquisitions. During the 2024 fiscal year, we completed eight acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, Georgia,\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina. As a result of these acquisitions, we added 11 asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction\nprofessionals. The total transaction consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $231.7 million. For further discussion regarding these transactions, see Note 4 -\nBusiness Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n• Lone Star Paving Acquisition. On November 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt, Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving)\n(“Lone Star Paving” and such acquisition, the “Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas,\nwith 10 HMA plants, four aggregate facilities, and one liquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone\nStar Acquisition consisted of (i) $654.2 million in cash (as adjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company,\nLone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J. Wheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 3.0 million shares\nof Class A common stock. In addition, we agreed to (A) pay cash to the selling unit holders in an amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at\nclosing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification obligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in\nquarterly installments over four quarters following the closing, and (B) purchase from the selling unit holders for $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real\nproperty following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from the proceeds of the Term Loan B (as defined\nherein). For more information about the Lone Star Acquisition, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n• Term Loan B Credit Agreement. On November 1, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA\nSecurities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC, Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint\nbookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term\nloan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the\nTerm Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone\nStar Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit\nfacility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement (as defined below), (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing\ntransactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For more information\nabout the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\n3\nTable of Contents\n• Credit Agreement Amendments. In May 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit\nAgreement with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and certain other lenders party from time to time thereto (as amended from time to time, the\n“Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from $325.0 million to\n$400.0 million, (ii) reallocate $125.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the revolving credit facility to our term loan, (iii) add three new banks to our\nlender syndicate, (iv) provide for an additional incremental credit facility of up to $200.0 million and (v) update certain affirmative and negative covenants thereunder.\nAdditionally, on October 30, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star\nAcquisition, (ii) entry into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit\nAgreement on a pari passu basis with the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. For further discussion regarding\nthe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the foregoing amendments, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this report.\n• Stock Repurchase Program. In April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40 million is available to purchase shares of\nour outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our\nequity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of our Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at\nprevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at\nany time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased are determined by a committee of the board of\ndirectors at its discretion and depend on a number of factors, including the market price of our Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and\neconomic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase\nprice of $10.0 million.\nWe operate in the large and growing highway and road construction industry and specifically within the asphalt paving materials and services segment. Asphalt paving mix is the\nmost common roadway material used today due to its cost effectiveness, durability and reusability, and minimized traffic disruption during paving, as compared to concrete. Recent\ngrowth in our industry has been driven by federal, state and local Department of Transportation (“DOT”) budgets, which annually earmark amounts for transportation and\ninfrastructure spending. In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law. The IIJA provides for $548 billion in new\ninfrastructure spending over five years through a reauthorization of traditional surface transportation programs and additional funding for highways, bridges and airports, among\nother things. In addition, certain states within our markets have recently approved legislation that supports funding for construction of local road, bridge and transit projects. The\nnon-discretionary nature of highway and road construction services and materials supports stable and consistent industry funding. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the\n“Inflation Reduction Act”) provides funding for numerous projects and initiatives relevant to the surface transportation industry, including grants for safety and environmental\nimprovements, incentives for the use of construction materials and products with lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions, and streamlined environmental review\nprocesses for proposed projects.\nProjects and Customers\nWe provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports, and commercial and\nresidential sites throughout the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. We provide a wide range of large sitework\nconstruction, including site development, paving, and utility and drainage systems construction, and supply the HMA required for the projects. Our projects consist of both new\nconstruction and maintenance services. Publicly funded projects and third-party sales accounted for approximately 63%, and privately funded projects and third-party sales\naccounted for approximately 37%, of our fiscal 2024 revenues. Our public customers include federal agencies, state DOTs and local municipalities. Our private clients include\ncommercial and residential developers and businesses.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Florida DOT accounted for 13.6% of our revenues, and projects performed for all DOTs\naccounted for 40.7% of our revenues. Other than the Florida DOT, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nOur 25 largest projects accounted for 15.7% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.\nTypes of Contracts\nOur public customer contracts are primarily fixed unit price contracts. Pricing on a fixed unit price contract is typically based on approved quantities. Our private customer contracts\nare primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. We also occasionally enter\ninto design-build contracts, which generally are performed under fixed total price contracts. For the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment when\n4\nTable of Contents\ncontracts are near completion or fully completed. For some contracts, we are required to furnish a warranty on our construction. These warranties, when required, are usually one\nyear in length, but can extend up to three years according to the owners’ specifications. Historically, warranty claims have not been material to our business.\nContract Management\nWe identify potential contracts through a variety of sources, including: (i) subscriber services that consolidate and alert us to contracts open for bidding; (ii) posted solicitations by\nfederal, state and local governmental entities through agency websites, disclosure of long-term infrastructure plans or advertising and other general solicitations; (iii) our business\ndevelopment efforts; and (iv) communications with other participants in our industry. We consider several factors that can create variability in contract performance and our\nfinancial results compared to our bid assumptions and methodologies on a contract. As a result, after determining the potential contracts that are available, we decide which\ncontracts to pursue based on a non-exclusive list of factors, which include relevant skills required by the contract, the contract size and duration, availability of our personnel and\nequipment, size and makeup of our current contract backlog, our competitive advantages and disadvantages, our prior experience, the contracting agency or customer, the source of\ncontract funding, the geographic location, the likely competition, the construction risks, the gross margin opportunities, the penalties or incentives and the type of contract.\nTo ensure the completeness and accuracy of our original bid analysis, the bid preparation for potential projects typically involves three phases.\n• Phase One: We review the plans and specifications of the project so that we can identify (i) the various types of work involved and related estimated materials, (ii) the\ncontract duration and schedule, and (iii) any unique aspects or significant risk factors of the project.\n• Phase Two: We estimate the cost and availability of labor, materials and equipment, subcontractors and the project team required to complete the contract in accordance\nwith the plans, specifications and construction schedule. Substantially all of our estimates are made on a per-unit basis for each bid item, with the typical contract containing\n50 to 200 bid items.\n• Phase Three: Management conducts a detailed review of the estimate. This review includes an analysis of assumptions regarding (i) cost, approach, means and methods of\ncompleting the project, (ii) staffing and productivity and (iii) risk. After concluding this detailed review of the cost estimate, management determines the appropriate profit\nmargin to calculate the total bid amount. This profit margin varies according to management’s perception of the degree of difficulty of the contract, the existing competitive\nclimate and the size and makeup of our contract backlog. Throughout this process, we work closely with our project managers so that all issues concerning a contract,\nincluding any risks, can be better understood and addressed as appropriate.\nTo ensure that subcontracting costs used in submitting bids for construction contracts do not change, we obtain firm quotations from our subcontractors before submitting a bid.\nAlso, to mitigate the risk of material price changes, we obtain “not to exceed” quotations from our suppliers, which, for projects of longer duration, usually contain price escalator\nprovisions. These quotations typically include quantity guarantees that are tied to our prime contract. We have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those\nrequired to complete the respective contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided.\nAfter a contract has been awarded and during the construction phase, we monitor our progress by comparing actual costs incurred and quantities completed to date with budgeted\namounts and the project schedule. We review our estimates of total forecasted revenue, cost and expected profit for each contract monthly.\nDuring the normal course of some projects, we or our customer may initiate modifications or changes to the original contract to reflect, among other things, changes in quantities,\nspecifications or design, method or manner of performance, facilities, materials, site conditions and period for completion of the work. Generally, the scope and price of these\nmodifications are documented in a “change order” to the original contract and reviewed, approved and paid for in accordance with the normal change order provisions of the\ncontract. Occasionally, we are asked to perform extra or change order work as directed by the customer even if the customer has not agreed in advance on the scope or price of the\nwork to be performed. This process may result in disputes over whether the work performed is beyond the scope of the work included in the original contract plans and\nspecifications or, even if the customer agrees that the work performed qualifies as extra work, the price that the customer is willing to pay for the extra work. These disputes may not\nbe settled to our satisfaction. Even when the customer agrees to pay for the extra work, we may be required to fund the cost of such work for an extended period of time until the\nchange order is approved and funded by the customer. In addition, any delay caused by the extra work may adversely impact the timely scheduling of other work on the contract (or\non other contracts) and our ability to meet contract milestone dates. Historically, we have been successful at managing the impacts caused by change orders, and change orders\nhave not had a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our contracts with governmental agencies provide for termination at the convenience of the customer, with requirements to pay us for work performed through the date of\ntermination. The termination of a government contract for the convenience of the customer\n5\nTable of Contents\nis an extremely rare occurrence. Many of our contracts contain provisions that require us to pay liquidated damages if specified completion schedule requirements are not met.\nHistorically, we have not been materially adversely affected by liquidated damages provisions.\nWe act as prime contractor on most of our construction projects. As prime contractor, we are responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. To\nmanage the risk of non-performance by our subcontractors, we typically require the subcontractor to furnish a bond or other type of security to guarantee its performance and/or we\nretain payments in accordance with contract terms until their performance is complete. Disadvantaged business enterprise regulations require us to use our good faith efforts to\nsubcontract a specified portion of contract work done for governmental agencies to certain types of disadvantaged contractors or suppliers.\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2023. Contract backlog is a financial measure that generally reflects the\ndollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in the future. Although contract backlog is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the\nUnited States (“GAAP”), it is a common measure used in our industry. We generally include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent\nwe believe funding is probable. Our backlog generally consists of uncompleted work on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not\ncommenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include (i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive\nconfirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing\ncontractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of uncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet\nbegun was $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur backlog also includes low bid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private\nwork projects for which we have been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog\nwas $0.5 billion and $0.3 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, we expected approximately 76% of our contract backlog to be completed\nduring the next 12 months.\nCertain customer contracts contain options that are exercisable at the discretion of our customer to award additional work to us, without requiring us to go through an additional\ncompetitive bidding process. In addition, some customer contracts also contain task orders that are signed under master contracts pursuant to which we perform work only when the\ncustomer awards specific task orders to us. Awarded contracts that include unexercised contract options and unissued task orders are included in contract backlog to the extent that\nthe exercise of such options or the issuance of such task orders is probable.\nSubstantially all of the contracts in our contract backlog, as well as unexercised contract options and unissued task orders, may be canceled or modified at the election of the\ncustomer. Historically, we have not experienced material amounts of contract cancellations or modifications. Many projects are added to our contract backlog and completed within\nthe same fiscal year and therefore may not be reflected in our beginning or year-end contract backlog. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA, aggregates, and\nliquid asphalt cement.\nInsurance and Bonding\nWe maintain general and excess liability, property, workers’ compensation and medical insurance, all in amounts consistent with industry practice.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security to the customer for our performance\nunder certain public and private sector contracts. Our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization, working capital, past performance, management expertise and\nexternal factors, including the capacity of the overall surety market. Surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our contract backlog that we have bonded and\ntheir underwriting standards. The capacity of the surety market is subject to market-based fluctuations driven primarily by the level of surety industry losses and the degree of\nsurety market consolidation.\nCompetition\nWe compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in which we operate. Competition is constrained in our industry because participants are limited by the distance\nthat materials can be efficiently transported, resulting in a fragmented market with thousands of participants nationwide, many of which are local or regional operators. Our\ncompetitors typically range from small, family-owned companies focused on a single material, product or market to multinational corporations that offer a wide array of\nconstruction materials, products and paving and related services. Factors influencing our competitiveness include price, estimating abilities, knowledge of local markets and\nconditions, project management, financial strength, reputation for quality, aggregate materials\n6\nTable of Contents\navailability and machinery and equipment. We believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in\nparticular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and\noperations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in\nthe construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher\nactivity and revenues during those quarters. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our third fiscal quarter\nvaries greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenue, while a warm, dry spring may\nfacilitate earlier project commencement dates.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe purchase raw materials, including, but not limited to, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt, other petroleum-based resources, sand and rock from numerous sources. With few exceptions,\nwe do not enter into long-term agreements to purchase raw materials. We receive quotes from suppliers, most with a “not to exceed” price for the quoted product over the life of a\nproject. In the HMA production process, components of a mix include virgin aggregates, such as sand and rock, liquid asphalt, and reclaimed asphalt pavement (“RAP”). We are\nable to internally supply RAP, a byproduct of asphalt resurfacing projects, to all of our HMA plants, and virgin aggregates in some of our market areas. The majority of our HMA\nplants sit in or near suppliers’ aggregates facilities, thereby reducing the hauling cost of material to our plant. The price and availability of raw materials may vary from year to year\ndue to market conditions and production capacities. We do not expect a lack of availability of any raw materials over the next 12 months.\nGovernment and Environmental Regulations\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the environmental, health and safety aspects of our operations or\notherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations and limitations on our operations, including:\n• zoning and other requirements to obtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities;\n• restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment;\n• limitation or prohibition of activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas;\n• obligations to restore or reclaim former mining areas;\n• requirements to comply with specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and\n• the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nSuch federal laws include, but are not limited to, (i) the Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Pollution Prevention\nAct and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, governing solid and hazardous waste management, (ii) the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water\nAct and the Safe Drinking Water Act, protecting air and water resources, and (iii) the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and Toxic Substances Control Act,\ngoverning the management of hazardous materials, (iv) the federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, requiring certain disclosures of mining-related health and safety violations,\norders, citations, assessments, legal actions, and mining-related fatalities, and (v) the Occupational Safety and Health Act, governing working conditions for workers, in addition to\nanalogous state laws. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and corresponding state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance\nwith these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to\ncomply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, compensatory damages, injunctive relief, the\nimposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in\nobtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict liability (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) as well as joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where\nhazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed, stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned\nor operated by us or at which we have disposed of materials, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from the consequences of our\n7\nTable of Contents\nown actions that complied with applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide\nindemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties we own, lease or operate could\nresult in increased operational costs or restrictions on our ability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to\nreceive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental,\nhealth and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is\nmade against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental\nlegislation and regulations applied to the construction industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. To the extent that laws are enacted or other\ngovernmental action is taken that restricts our operations or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business,\nprospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities may\nincrease our future expenditures to comply with environmental requirements.\nWe regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our\noperations and facilities, whether owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any existing non-compliance is not\nlikely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nIndustrial operations, including equipment maintenance and storage, asphalt manufacturing and processing, underground storage tank usage and other storage and use of hazardous\nmaterials and petroleum products, are conducted at our facilities, and in some cases, have been conducted at our facilities for more than 50 years. While we have conducted our\noperations in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws, we have, from time to time, identified contamination associated with these activities at certain of our\nfacilities. We have incurred costs in connection with the investigation and remediation of hazardous substances and petroleum products identified at several facilities, and\ninvestigation and remediation activities are ongoing at others. We may also become subject to similar liabilities in connection with prior and future acquisitions. We do not believe\nthat liabilities associated with known or potential contamination at any of our facilities will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we employed 1,325 salaried employees and 3,595 hourly employees. The total number of hourly personnel at a given time is subject to the volume of\nprojects in progress and fluctuates on a seasonal basis. During fiscal year 2024, the number of hourly employees ranged from 3,044 to 3,595 employees and averaged 3,256\nemployees. As of November 20, 2024, after giving effect to the Lone Star Acquisition, we employed 1,484 salaried employees and 4,218 hourly employees. We are not subject to\nany collective bargaining agreements with respect to any of our employees. We believe that we have strong relationships with our employees.\nOur business depends on a readily available supply of management, supervisory and field personnel. Attracting, training and retaining key personnel has been and will remain\ncritical to our success. Through the use of our management information systems, on-the-job training, and educational seminars, employees are trained to understand the importance\nof project execution. We place additional focus on training related to estimating, project management and project cost control. Our crews typically specialize in a specific phase of\nconstruction, such as grading or paving, with each crew member assigned to a specific task in order to maximize daily production. A core tenet of our organizational philosophy is\nto promote from within and offer advancement opportunities at all levels of employment, which helps us retain talented employees. Moreover, we proactively recruit additional\ntalent in both conventional and creative manners to fill open positions when promoting internally is not an option. Like others in our industry, we experience some recurring\nemployee turnover; however, we have historically been able to attract sufficient numbers of personnel to support the growth of our operations. Nonetheless, we continue to face\ncompetition for experienced workers in all of our markets.\nWe place a great emphasis on the safety of the public, our customers and our employees. To that end, we conduct extensive safety training programs, which have allowed us to\nmaintain a high safety level at our worksites. All newly-hired employees undergo an initial safety orientation, and for certain types of projects and processes, we conduct specific\nhazard training programs. Our project foremen and superintendents conduct on-site safety meetings, and our full-time safety inspectors make random site safety inspections and\nperform assessments. In addition, certain operational employees are required to complete a safety course approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(“OSHA”) or the Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), as applicable. Moreover, we promote a culture of safety by encouraging employees to immediately correct and\nreport all unsafe conditions.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWebsite Information\nWe maintain a website at www.constructionpartners.net.

Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock involves risks. You should carefully read and consider the following risks, as well as all of the other information contained in this\nreport, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. As a\nresult, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face.\nAdditional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nA significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions, particularly in the southern United States, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe currently operate in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. A significant slowdown or decline in economic conditions or uncertainty\nregarding the economic outlook in the United States generally, or in any of these states particularly, could reduce demand for infrastructure projects. Demand for infrastructure\nprojects depends on overall economic conditions, the need for new or replacement infrastructure, the priorities placed on various projects funded by governmental entities and\nfederal, state and local government spending levels. In particular, low tax revenues, credit rating downgrades, budget deficits and financing constraints, including timing and\namount of federal funding and competing governmental priorities, could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new public infrastructure projects.\nIn addition, any instability in the financial and credit markets could negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay us on a timely basis, or at all, for work on projects already in\nprogress, could cause our customers to delay or cancel construction projects in our contract backlog and could create difficulties for customers to obtain adequate financing to fund\nnew construction projects, including through the issuance of municipal bonds.\nOur business depends on federal, state and local government spending for public infrastructure construction, and reductions in government funding could adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we generated approximately 63% of our construction contract revenues from publicly funded construction projects and the sale of\nconstruction materials to public customers at the federal, state and local levels. As a result, if publicly funded construction decreases due to reduced federal, state or local funding or\notherwise, our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal highway bills provide spending authorizations that represent the maximum amounts available for federally funded construction projects. Each year, Congress passes an\nappropriation act establishing the amount that can be used for particular programs. The annual funding level is generally tied to receipts of highway user taxes placed in the federal\nHighway Trust Fund. Once Congress passes the annual appropriation, the federal government distributes funds to each state based on formulas or other procedures. States generally\nmust spend these funds on the specific programs outlined in the federal legislation. In recent years, the Highway Trust Fund has faced insolvency as outlays have outpaced\nrevenues, and annual shortfalls have been addressed primarily by short-term measures. In November 2021, the IIJA was signed into law, which provided additional funding for\nhighways, bridges and airports over a five-year period. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act passed in August 2022 has provided funding for a variety of infrastructure-related\nprograms. Although these laws provide for funding at historically high levels, the timing, nature and scale of the projects for which these funds under these programs or otherwise\nwill be used remains uncertain given variations in the appropriation processes at the federal and state levels. As a result, we cannot be assured of the existence, timing or amount of\nfuture federal highway funding. Federal highway funding is also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional spending as a whole, including the potential impacts of\nbudget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Any reduction in federal highway funding, particularly in the amounts allocated to states in which we operate,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n9\nTable of Contents\nEach state funds its infrastructure spending from specially allocated amounts collected from various state taxes, typically fuel taxes and vehicle fees, as well as from voter-approved\nbond programs. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amount spent or delay expenditures on state infrastructure projects. Many states have experienced state-level funding\npressures caused by lower tax revenues and an inability to finance approved projects. Any reduction in state infrastructure funding in the states in which we operate could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from state DOTs. The loss of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully contract with state DOTs could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur largest customers are state DOTs. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Florida DOT accounted for 13.6% of our revenues, and projects performed for all state\nDOTs accounted for 40.7% of our revenues. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we completed the Lone Star Acquisition. The customers of Lone Star Paving\ninclude the Texas Department of Transportation (“TxDOT”), local municipalities, heavy civil contractors, and commercial and residential developers. As result of the Lone Star\nAcquisition, we anticipate that TxDOT will be among our top five customers (based on revenues) in the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. We believe that we will continue to\nrely on state DOTs for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The loss or reduction of our ability to competitively bid for certain projects or successfully\ncontract with state DOTs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and liquidity. See Note 2 - Significant Accounting Policies,\nConcentration of Risks, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for information relating to concentrations of revenues by type of customer and for\na description of our largest customers.\nGovernment contracts generally are subject to a variety of regulations, requirements and statutes, the violation or alleged violation of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nOur contracts with governmental agencies are generally subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to\ntheir formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. We may be subject to claims for civil or criminal\nfraud for actual or alleged violations of these governmental regulations, requirements or statutes. In addition, we may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private\nindividuals on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of these\nregulations, requirements or statutes, or if we have a substantial number of workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated, and we could be\nsuspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Even if we have not violated these regulations, requirements or\nstatutes, allegations of violations or defending qui tam litigation could harm our reputation and require us to incur material costs to defend any such allegations or lawsuits. Any one\nor more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe cancellation of a significant number of contracts, our disqualification from bidding on new contracts and the unpredictable timing of new project opportunities could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment contracts typically can be canceled at any time, with us receiving payment only for the work completed. The cancellation of an unfinished contract could result in lost\nrevenues and cause our equipment to be idled for a significant period of time until other comparable work becomes available. In addition, we could be prohibited from bidding on\ncertain government contracts if we fail to maintain qualifications required by those entities. For example, various laws, including those governing wages, benefits, overtime,\nworking conditions, equal employment opportunity, affirmative action and drug testing, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances\ninvolving violations of those laws. In addition, federal and state laws provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances, including as a result of being\nconvicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The\nscope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts of a particular case and the grounds for debarment. Finally, the timing of project awards is\nunpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding\nprocesses.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, revenues or costs on our projects, we may incur contract losses or achieve lower profits than anticipated.\nPricing on fixed unit price contracts is based on approved quantities irrespective of our actual costs, and contracts with a fixed total price require that the work be performed for an\nagreed-upon price irrespective of our actual costs. We generate profits on fixed unit price and fixed total price contracts only when our revenues exceed our actual costs, which\nrequires us to accurately estimate and control our costs and avoid cost overruns. If our cost estimates are too low or if we do not perform the contract within our cost estimates, then\ncost overruns may cause us to incur a loss or cause the contract not to be as profitable as we expected. The costs incurred and profit realized, if any, on our contracts can vary,\nsometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n10\nTable of Contents\n• the failure to include materials or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a fixed total price contract;\n• delays caused by weather conditions or otherwise failing to meet scheduled acceptance dates;\n• contract or project modifications or conditions creating unanticipated costs that are not covered by change orders;\n• changes in the availability, proximity and costs of materials, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction materials, as well as fuel and lubricants for\nour equipment;\n• to the extent not covered by contractual cost escalators, variability in, and our inability to predict, the costs of diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and cement;\n• the availability and skill level of workers;\n• onsite conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n• the failure by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers or customers to perform their obligations;\n• fraud, theft or other improper activities by our suppliers, subcontractors, designers, engineers, customers or personnel;\n• mechanical problems with our machinery or equipment;\n• citations issued by a government authority, including OSHA or MSHA;\n• difficulties in obtaining required government permits or approvals;\n• changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n• uninsured claims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part; and\n• public infrastructure customers seeking to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions that result in increased risks to us.\nThese and other factors may cause us to incur losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, some of which we may not be able to recoup.\nInflation and supply chain disruptions have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unable to pass through\nincreased costs to our customers. In recent years, we experienced an upward trend in several inflation-sensitive inputs that we use to provide our products and services, including\nupward pressure on wages and increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce HMA and other items critical to our business, including fuel, concrete and steel. We also\nexperienced disruptions from various participants in our supply chains, including subcontractors, materials suppliers and equipment manufacturers, who provide the raw materials,\nequipment, vehicles, construction supplies and other services we require in order to manufacture HMA and perform our construction projects. Although we have been able to\nmitigate some of the effects of inflation, supply chain disruptions and upward wage pressures on our business by increasing prices for our products and including the anticipated\ncost increases in the construction projects for which we bid, we may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, we are limited in our ability to pass through increased costs for\nprojects already in our backlog, and if we are unable to do so, we may not recoup our losses or diminished profit margins. If we experience significant inflation or supply chain\ndisruptions going forward, we may be required to implement further price adjustments to maintain our profit margin, and any price increases may have a negative effect on\ndemand.\n11\nTable of Contents\nBecause our industry is capital-intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume.\nThe property, plants and equipment needed to produce our products and provide our services are expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain\nsuch assets. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our\ncurrently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plants and equipment necessary to operate our\nbusiness, or if the timing of payments on our receivables is delayed, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness. In\naddition, due to the level of fixed and semi-fixed costs associated with our business, particularly at our HMA production facilities, aggregates facilities and our mobile equipment\nfleets, volume decreases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy, to successfully integrate acquired businesses and to retain key employees of\nacquired businesses.\nSince our inception, we have acquired and integrated 48 complementary businesses, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We continue to evaluate strategic\nacquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business, including acquisitions in the southern United States, as part of our ongoing growth strategy.\nWe cannot predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions. To successfully acquire a target, we may need to raise additional equity and/or incur additional indebtedness, which\ncould increase our leverage level. We may be unable to identify and complete acquisition transactions on favorable terms, or at all. The investigation of acquisition candidates and\nthe negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments require substantial management time and attention and costs for\naccountants, attorneys and others. If we fail to complete any acquisition for any reason, including events beyond our control, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed\nacquisition likely would not be recoverable.\nAcquisitions typically require integration of the acquired company’s estimation, project management, finance, information technology, risk management, purchasing and fleet\nmanagement functions. We may be unable to successfully integrate an acquired business into our existing business, and an acquired business may not be as profitable as we had\nexpected or at all. Acquisitions involve risks that the acquired business will not perform as expected and that our expectations concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of the\nacquired business will prove incorrect. Our inability to successfully integrate new businesses in a timely and orderly manner could increase costs, reduce profits or generate losses\nand prevent us from realizing expected rates of return on an acquired business. Factors affecting the successful integration of an acquired business include, but are not limited to,\nthe following:\n• our responsibility for certain liabilities of an acquired business, whether or not known to us, which could include, among other things, tax liabilities, product and other tort\nliabilities, breach of contract claims, environmental liabilities, permitting and regulatory compliance issues and liabilities for employment practices;\n• our ability to retain local managers and key employees who are important to the operations of an acquired business;\n• the attention required by our senior management and the management of an acquired business for integration efforts, which could decrease the time that they have to service\nand attract customers;\n• our ability to effectively utilize new equipment that we acquire;\n• the implementation of our financial and management information systems, business practices and policies;\n• our pursuit of multiple acquisition opportunities simultaneously; and\n• unforeseen expenses, complications and delays, including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight.\nIn addition, potential acquisition targets may be in states in which we do not currently operate. For example, on November 1, 2024, we acquired Lone Star Paving in Texas, a\ngeographic region in which the Company has not historically operated. The Lone Star Acquisition or any future acquisition in a new geographic region could result in unforeseen\noperating challenges and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and facilities and subject us to unfamiliar legal requirements.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will achieve synergies and cost savings in connection with recent and future acquisitions. Many of the businesses that we previously acquired, and\nbusinesses that we may acquire in the future, could have unaudited financial statements that are prepared by management and are not independently reviewed or audited, and such\nfinancial statements could be materially different if they were independently reviewed or audited. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations\nconsistent with our prior acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We also cannot know whether there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable\nprices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these\nacquisitions could, in the future, result in\n12\nTable of Contents\nimpairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill or other long-lived assets, particularly if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly.\nWe may lose business to competitors that underbid us and may be unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry.\nMost of our project awards are determined through a competitive bidding process in which price is the determining factor. Because of the high cost of transporting HMA, our\nability to win a project award is often influenced by the distance between a work site and our HMA plants. We compete against multiple competitors in many of the markets in\nwhich we operate. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and are vertically integrated. As a result, our competitors may be able to bid at lower prices than we can due to\nthe location of their plants or as a result of their size or vertical integration advantages. Government funding for public infrastructure projects is limited, contributing to competition\nfor the limited number of public projects available. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new project awards to us at acceptable profit margins. In addition, in the\nevent of a downturn in private residential and commercial construction, the competition for available public infrastructure projects could intensify, which could materially and\nadversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient bonding capacity, which could preclude us from bidding on certain projects.\nA significant number of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. Sureties typically issue or continue bonds on a project-by-project basis, and they can decline to do so\nat any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition thereto. Our ability to obtain performance and payment bonds primarily depends on our capitalization,\nworking capital, past performance, management expertise, reputation and certain external factors, including the overall capacity of the surety market. Events that adversely affect\nthe insurance and bonding markets generally may result in bonding becoming more difficult or costly to obtain in the future. If we are unable to obtain or renew a sufficient level of\nbonding, or if bonding costs were to increase, we may be precluded from bidding on certain projects or successfully contracting with certain customers, which could limit the\naggregate dollar amount of contracts that we are able to pursue. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required\nto post letters of credit in connection with such bonds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and subject to adverse weather and climate conditions, which can adversely impact our business.\nOur construction operations occur outdoors in an area of the country in which weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes and tropical storms are common and snow frequently\noccurs in certain markets in the winter. For example, Hurricanes Debby, Francine and Helene all made landfall in the southeastern United States during our fourth fiscal quarter of\n2024 and disrupted operations in various portions of our geographic footprint through flooding, extended power outages and road closures, among other issues. These and similar\nseasonal changes and adverse weather conditions, such as extended snowy, rainy or cold weather, can adversely affect our business operations through a decline in the use and\nproduction of HMA, a decline in the demand for our construction services, alterations and delays in our construction schedules, extended power outages limiting the use of plants\nand equipment and reduced efficiencies in our contracting operations, resulting in under-utilization of crews and equipment and lower contract profitability. Climate change may\nlead to increased extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, including natural disasters. Should the impact of climate change be significant or occur for lengthy\nperiods of time, our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and processes, which are subject to cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nWe depend on information technology systems and infrastructure that could be damaged or interrupted by a variety of factors. Any significant breach, breakdown, destruction or\ninterruption of these systems has the potential to negatively affect our operations. We could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a\nresult of a cybersecurity attack, such as the infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or through our third-party providers. Although\nwe have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, our efforts\nmay not prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Similarly, our\nsuppliers rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage their businesses and, thus, are also at risk of, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks.\nAlthough we have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident or business interruption event to date, an interruption in the business operations of our suppliers and other third\nparties with which we do business resulting from a cybersecurity attack could indirectly impact our business operations.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions.\nDesign-build contracts are used as a method of project delivery that provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally\nsubcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission that causes damages, there is a risk that the\nsubcontractor and/or its errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the full amount of the liability incurred. In this case, we may be responsible for the remaining\nliability, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we enter into joint venture contracts to perform certain projects, and these arrangements expose us to certain risks and uncertainties that are outside of our\ncontrol.\nFrom time to time, we perform construction projects as part of a joint venture, under which our relationship to the other joint venture partners is governed by a written contract.\nParticipation in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that our partners may fail to perform under the contracts, which could subject us to\ncontractual liability. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or the joint venture\narrangement is terminated, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the project, or we could be liable for financial penalties or liquidated damages. In the event that we are not\nthe controlling partner in the joint venture, we may have limited control over the decisions made with respect to the project. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur continued success requires us to hire, train and retain qualified personnel and subcontractors in a competitive industry.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified, reliable personnel, including, but not limited to, our executive officers and key management\npersonnel. In addition, we rely on engineers, project management personnel, other employees and qualified subcontractors who possess the necessary and required experience and\nexpertise to perform their respective services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense, and it may be difficult to attract\nand retain qualified individuals with the requisite expertise and within the time frame demanded by our customers. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to\nsatisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire, train and retain qualified personnel. Also, it could be difficult to replace personnel who hold\ncredentials that may be required to perform certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.\nAs some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we must provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to\nidentify and integrate new personnel into vacant leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively\nimplement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects and our strategic plan may be adversely affected, the costs of executing both our existing and future projects\nmay increase, and our financial performance may decline.\nIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award\ntiming can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from\nexcess staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases.\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs from time to time,\nincluding high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and other government regulations. Although we have not experienced material disruptions due to labor\nshortages to date, we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee\nbase could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to\ncomplete our construction projects according to the required schedule or otherwise efficiently operate our business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of\nperforming at a high level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended\nnegative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking\ncapacity due to shortages of drivers and increased fuel costs has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled\nlabor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on third parties for equipment and supplies essential to operate our business.\nWe rely on third parties to sell or lease real property, plants and equipment to us and to provide us with supplies, including liquid asphalt cement, aggregates and other construction\nmaterials necessary for our operations. The inability to purchase or lease the properties, plants or equipment that are necessary for our operations could severely impact our\nbusiness. If we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from third parties to meet our customers’ needs, or if our suppliers experience price increases or\ndisruptions to their business, such as labor disputes, supply shortages, financial or regulatory difficulties or distribution problems, our ability to bid for or complete contracts could\nbe impaired, in which case our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of raw materials needed for HMA production, equipment, vehicles and construction supplies, could increase our costs or cause delays\nin our ability to complete our projects, which could have an adverse impact on our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely on our supply chain for raw materials to manufacture HMA and for equipment, vehicles and construction supplies in order to complete our projects. A reduction or\ninterruption in supply, including disruptions due to shortages in global freight capacity, significant increases in the price of critical components and raw materials, a failure to\nappropriately forecast or adjust our requirements based on our business needs, a significant natural disaster or volatility in demand for our products and services could materially\nadversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Our vendors and subcontractors also may be unable to\nmeet our demand, significantly increase lead times for deliveries or impose significant price increases that we are unable to offset through alternate sources of supply, price\nincreases to our customers or increased productivity in our operations. In some cases, we procure certain inputs and services from single or limited suppliers or subcontractors. In\nthe event of supply disruptions from these suppliers or subcontractors, we may not be able to diversify our resources for such materials or services in a timely manner or may\nexperience quality issues with alternate sources. Our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in large part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of raw materials,\nplant components, equipment and vehicles from our suppliers, and significant disruptions in their supply could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and\nfinancial condition and could materially damage customer relationships.\nWe consume natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential reliability issues, supply constraints and\nsignificant price fluctuations.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The\navailability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control, such as unavailability due to refinery turnarounds, higher prices charged for\npetroleum-based products and other factors. Furthermore, we are vulnerable to any reliability issues experienced by our suppliers, which also are beyond our control. Our suppliers\ncontract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted if our suppliers are unable to obtain these materials due to higher demand or\nother factors that interrupt their availability. Additionally, increases in the costs of fuel and other petroleum-based products utilized in our operations, particularly increases\nfollowing a bid based on lower costs for such products, could result in a lower profit, or a loss, on a contract. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur contract backlog is subject to reductions in scope and cancellations and therefore could be an unreliable indicator of our future earnings.\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion, compared to $1.6 billion at September 30, 2023. Our contract backlog generally consists of construction projects for\nwhich we either have an executed contract or commitment with a client or have submitted the currently lowest bid. Contract backlog does not include external sales of HMA,\naggregates and liquid asphalt cement. Moreover, our contract backlog reflects our expected revenues from the contract, commitment or bid, which is often subject to revision over\ntime. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be\naffected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenues and profit we ultimately realize on these\nprojects.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as expected could have a negative impact on our results.\nWe rely on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on many of our contracts, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work.\nAlthough we often require bonding or other forms of guarantees from our subcontractors, we are not always able to obtain such bonds or guarantees. In situations where we are\nunable to obtain a bond or guarantee, we may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated. In addition, if the total costs of a project\nexceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe construction services industry is highly schedule-driven, and our failure to meet the schedule requirements of our contracts could adversely affect our reputation and/or\nexpose us to financial liability.\nIn some instances, including in the case of many of our fixed unit price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. Any failure to meet the contractual\nschedule or satisfy the completion requirements set forth in our contracts could subject us to responsibility for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually\nagreed-upon liquidated damages, liability for our customer’s actual costs arising out of our delay, reduced profits or a loss on that project and/or damage to our reputation, any of\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAn inability to secure sufficient aggregates reserves could have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nStrict governmental regulations and the limited number of properties containing useful aggregates reserves have made it increasingly challenging and costly to obtain sufficient\naggregates to support our business, both with respect to internal use and third-party sales. If we are unable to obtain adequate reserves to support our business, then our\nfinancial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nA failure to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy, and a majority of our contracts require us to maintain specific types and amounts of coverage.\nAlthough we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nFor example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage and increased premium costs or deductibles. If we are unable to obtain adequate\ninsurance coverage, we would be subject to increased out-of-pocket expenses in the event of a claim and we may not be able to procure certain contracts, either of which could\nmaterially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified “disadvantaged business enterprises” to perform as subcontractors, which could cause us to breach certain contracts\nwith governmental customers.\nSome of our contracts with governmental agencies contain minimum “disadvantaged business enterprise” (“DBE”) participation clauses, which require us to maintain a requisite\nlevel of DBE participation. If we fail to obtain or maintain the required level of DBE participation, we could be held responsible for breach of contract. Such a breach could impair\nour ability to bid on future projects and could require us to pay monetary damages. To the extent that we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could\nexceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of\noperations, cash flows or liquidity.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses, which could materially affect our business and reputation.\nBecause our employees and others are often in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical substances and dangerous manufacturing processes, our\nconstruction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces. Therefore, safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. We\nare often responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. In addition, many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts,\nand some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also can increase employee turnover, which increases project costs and\ntherefore our overall operating costs. If we fail to implement effective safety procedures, our employees could be injured, the completion of a project could be delayed, or we could\nbe exposed to investigations and possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could also result in reduced profitability or the\nloss of projects or clients.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could incur material costs and losses as a result of claims that our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications.\nWe provide our customers with products designed to comply with building codes or other regulatory requirements, as well as any applicable contractual specifications, including,\nbut not limited to, with respect to durability, compressive strength and weight-bearing capacity. If our products do not satisfy these requirements and specifications, material claims\nmay arise against us, our reputation could be damaged and, if any such claims are for an uninsured, non-indemnified or product-related matter, then resolution of such claims\nagainst us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWe are, and may continue to be, involved in routine litigation and government inquiries in the ordinary course of business.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things,\nworkers’ compensation claims, employment-related disputes and issues related to liability, breach of contract or tortious conduct in connection with our performance of services and\nprovision of materials. We are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance with government construction\ncontracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. The outcomes of these inquiries and legal proceedings are not\nexpected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations on an individual basis, although adverse outcomes in a significant number of such ordinary\ncourse inquiries and legal proceedings could, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and any changes to, or liabilities arising under, such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,\nresults of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of pollutants and materials into the environment or otherwise\nrelating to environmental protection and public health and safety. These laws and regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including requirements to\nobtain a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the\nenvironment; limitations on activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and assessments of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting\nfrom our operations. For example, a number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory actions to reduce emissions of\ngreenhouse gases, such as monitoring, reporting and emissions control requirements for certain large sources of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs.\nBecause we emit greenhouse gases through the manufacture of HMA products and through the combustion of fossil fuels as part of our mining and road construction services, any\nsuch laws and regulations applicable to jurisdictions in which we operate could require us to incur costs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with our operations.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or third-party facilities that receive\nwaste generated by our operations, regardless of whether such contamination resulted from our own actions or those of others and whether such actions complied with applicable\nlaws at the time they were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could assume, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could\nexpose us to material losses. Furthermore, the existence of contamination at properties that we own, lease or operate could result in increased operational costs or restrictions on our\nability to use those properties as intended, including for mining purposes. For example, our lease agreements associated with our aggregates facilities could, if not appropriately\nmanaged, subject us to specific reclamation obligations, costs, or liabilities for any contamination or regulatory violations arising from our mining operations.\nNumerous government authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and the\npermits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Certain environmental laws impose strict liability\n(i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) or joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have\nbeen stored or released. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties,\ncompensatory damages, injunctive relief, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In\naddition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nIn certain instances, citizen groups also have the ability to bring legal proceedings against us if we are not in compliance with environmental laws, or to challenge our ability to\nreceive environmental permits that we need to operate. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental,\nhealth and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is\nmade against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental\nlegislation and regulations applied to our industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and, consequently, affecting profitability. Additionally, legal\nrequirements are changing frequently and are subject to interpretation. New laws, regulations and changing interpretations by regulatory authorities may increase our future\nexpenditures to comply with environmental requirements, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change and related laws and regulations could adversely affect us.\nThe potential impact of climate change on our operations and our customers remains uncertain. The primary risk that climate change poses to our business is the potential for\nincreases in the volume, frequency and intensity of rainfall and tropical storms, which would impair our ability to perform our construction projects. Climate change could also lead\nto disruptions in our supply chain, thereby impairing our production capabilities, or the distribution of our products due to major storm events or prolonged adverse conditions,\nchanging temperature levels or flooding from sea level changes, especially in our coastal markets. These changes could be severe and\n17\nTable of Contents\ncould negatively impact demand for our products and services. In addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change could, if adopted, restrict our operations, require us to\nmake capital or other expenditures to comply with these initiatives, increase our costs, impact our ability to compete or negatively impact efforts to obtain permits, licenses and\nother approvals for existing and new facilities. Our inability to timely respond to the risks posed by climate change and the costs of compliance with climate change laws and\nregulations could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIncreasing focus by stakeholders on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) policies and practices could result in additional costs and could adversely impact our\nreputation, investor perception, employee retention and willingness of third parties to do business with us.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing focus from stakeholders, including government agencies, investors, consumers and employees, on our ESG policies and practices.\nAdditionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continues to grow. If our policies and practices do not meet regulatory\nrequirements or stakeholders’ evolving expectations for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship, employee health and safety practices,\ndirector and employee diversity, human capital management and corporate governance, our reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and customers and\nsuppliers may be unwilling to do business with us. In addition, we are subject to various federal and state laws in connection with our operations, and inconsistency in legislation\nand regulations among jurisdictions and expected additional regulations may require greater resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices. Any assessment of\nthe potential impact of future ESG-related regulations or industry standards is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change where we operate. As a result, the\neffects of increased focus by stakeholders on ESG matters could have short- and long-term impacts on our business and operations.\nOur operations are subject to special hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses that may not be covered by\ninsurance.\nOperating hazards inherent in our business, some of which may be outside of our control, can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and\nenvironmental damage. We maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against risks that we believe are consistent with industry practice, but this insurance may be inadequate or\nunavailable to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations. Our insurance policies are subject to varying levels of deductibles. Losses up to our deductible amounts\nare accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. However, liabilities subject to insurance are\ndifficult to estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of unreported incidents\nand the effectiveness of our safety programs. If we experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates, we may be required to use working capital to satisfy these claims\nrather than for maintaining or expanding our operations.\nOur failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities, harm our reputation with our customers and disrupt our operations.\nAlthough we take steps to verify the employment eligibility status of all of our employees, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers.\nUnauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse\npublicity that could make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause\ntemporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and result in additional adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related\nto claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. If we fail to comply with these laws, our operations may be\ndisrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration\nlaws, and, in some cases, our customers’ audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure that our subcontractors comply with these laws\nwith respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws or to ensure compliance by our subcontractors could damage our reputation and may\ncause our customers to cancel contracts with us or to not award future business to us. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nFederal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations could increase our cost of doing business and subject us to fines and lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local employment-related laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which\ngoverns such matters as minimum wages, the Family Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, regulations of the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission, regulations of the Office of Civil Rights, regulations of the Department of Labor, regulations of state attorneys general, federal and state wage and hour\nlaws, and a variety of similar laws enacted by the federal and state governments that govern these and other employment-related matters. As our employees are located in a number\nof states, compliance with these evolving federal, state\n18\nTable of Contents\nand local laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business. In recent years, companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits,\nalleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, overtime wage policies, discrimination and similar matters, some of which have resulted\nin the payment of meaningful damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits may be threatened or instituted against us from time to time, and we may incur damages and expenses\nresulting from lawsuits of this type, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently subject to employee-\nrelated legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that we have adequate reserves for those losses that we believe are probable and can be reasonably\nestimated, the ultimate results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nOur debt consists primarily of our borrowings under our (i) Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior first lien term loan facility, under which $392.2\nmillion of principal was outstanding at as of September 30, 2024 (the “Term Loan A”) and a $400.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and (ii) Term\nLoan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain lenders party from time to time thereto (the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement,” and\ntogether with the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, the “Credit Agreements”), which provides for a fully drawn senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate\nprincipal amount of $850 million (the “Term Loan B,” and together with the Term Loan A, the “Term Loans”).\nA significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations, or have future borrowings available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Among other consequences, this level of indebtedness could:\n• require us to use a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations for debt service and the satisfaction of repayment obligations, and not for other purposes;\n• limit our ability to borrow money or issue equity to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements;\n• cause our interest expense to increase if there is a general increase in interest rates, because a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates;\n• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and future business opportunities;\n• cause us to be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n• make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; and\n• limit our ability to exploit business opportunities.\nVolatility in the credit markets, including due to changes in interest rates in the United States, may further increase our interest payments. We have secured overnight financing rate\n(“SOFR”)-based floating rate borrowings under the Credit Agreements, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. SOFR has\na limited history as a reference rate, and changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates. As a result, the amount of interest\nwe may pay on our variable rate indebtedness is difficult to predict.\nAlthough the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we could incur\nsubstantial additional indebtedness in compliance with these restrictions. This could reduce our ability to satisfy our current obligations and further exacerbate the risks to our\nfinancial condition described above.\nThe Credit Agreements restrict our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nThe Credit Agreements contain a number of covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, create liens on assets, change our or our subsidiaries’\nfiscal year, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, enter into certain restrictive agreements, engage in mergers or consolidations, participate in partnerships and joint ventures,\nsell assets, incur additional liens, pay dividends or distributions and make other restricted payments, make investments, loans or advances, repay or amend the terms of subordinated\nindebtedness, make acquisitions, enter into certain operating leases, enter into certain hedge transactions, amend material contracts and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.\nThe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio, and the Credit Agreements contain\ncertain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default (including, among others, an event of default upon a change of control). If an event of\ndefault occurs, the lenders under the Credit Agreements will be entitled to accelerate amounts due thereunder and take\n19\nTable of Contents\nother actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor, subject to an intercreditor agreement between the administrative agent under each Credit Agreement on behalf of the\nlenders party to each Credit Agreement. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or\nthat we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all, which could impair our ability to operate our business or\nachieve our growth objectives.\nOur ongoing ability to generate cash is important for funding our continuing operations, making acquisitions and servicing our indebtedness. To the extent that existing cash\nbalances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide\nneeded working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part on prevailing market\nconditions, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial\ninstitutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our Revolving Credit Facility may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not\navailable on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make certain investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities or respond to competitive challenges, each of\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be required to record an impairment charge if we determine that goodwill recorded in connection with prior acquisitions has become impaired, and this determination\nrequires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the future that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties.\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had $231.7 million and $159.3 million, respectively, of goodwill recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We assess goodwill for\nimpairment annually or more often if required. Our assessments involve a number of estimates and assumptions that are inherently subjective and require significant judgment\nregarding highly uncertain matters that are subject to change. The use of different assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination as to whether or not an\nimpairment has occurred. In addition, if future events are less favorable than what we assumed or estimated in our impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment\ncharge, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our\nmanagement. Our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nThe accounting standards that we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require us to make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and\napplying those standards. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. We\nmake critical estimates and assumptions involving accounting matters, including with respect to revenue recognition, contracts receivable including retainage, valuation of long-\nlived assets and goodwill, income taxes, accrued insurance costs and share-based payments and other equity transactions. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are\ninherently uncertain and require us to make subjective and complex judgments. Although we believe we have the experience and processes to enable us to formulate appropriate\nassumptions and produce reasonably dependable estimates, these assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously\nrecognized revenues and profit. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different methods to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ, which could\nhave a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. For more information about our critical accounting policies and use of estimates, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”\nUnfavorable developments affecting the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, liquidity and financial condition and overall results of\noperations.\nActual events, concerns or speculation about disruption or instability in the banking and financial services industry, such as liquidity constraints, the failure of individual\ninstitutions, or the inability of individual institutions or the banking and financial service industry generally to meet their contractual obligations, could significantly impair our\naccess to capital, delay access to deposits or other financial assets, or cause actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. Similarly, these events, concerns or\nspeculation could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations\non access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our customers, critical vendors and\nbusiness partners also could be adversely affected by these risks as described above, which in turn could result in their committing a breach or default under their contractual\nagreements with us, their insolvency or bankruptcy, or other adverse effects. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources, or non-compliance of\nbanking and financial services counterparties with their contractual commitments to us could, among other risks, have material adverse impacts on our ability to meet our operating\nexpenses and other financial needs, could result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations and could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Risks\nForce majeure events, such as natural disasters, pandemics and terrorist attacks, and unexpected equipment failures could negatively impact our business, which may affect\nour financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure events, such as terrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters, have impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, the U.S. economy and the markets in which\nwe operate. As an example, from time to time, we face unexpected severe weather conditions, evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services, increased labor and material\ncosts or shortages, inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to work sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity. We seek to include language\nin our contracts with private customers that grants us certain relief in connection with force majeure events, and we attempt to mitigate the potential impact arising from force\nmajeure events in both public and private customer contracts. However, the extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our customers, and we remain\nobligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events, subject to any relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. Additionally, our manufacturing\nprocesses depend on critical pieces of equipment, such as our HMA plants. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures or damage. Any\nsignificant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage and cause us to lose revenues due to lost\nproduction time. These force majeure events and unexpected equipment failures may affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers and could impact our revenues,\nproduction capability and ability to complete contracts in a timely manner.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial condition.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses associated with our financial reporting and corporate governance requirements, including\nrequirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and rules implemented by the SEC. For example, as a publicly\ntraded company, we are required to adopt policies regarding internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures, including the preparation of reports on internal control over\nfinancial reporting. These rules and regulations have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,\nand we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult\nfor us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements and our Company,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have designed and implemented a number of internal controls and other remedial measures that we believe will provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a material misstatement\nof our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or\ncause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline and impact our liquidity, perceived creditworthiness and ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs related to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”). If we are unable\nto timely comply with such requirements, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management’s\nassessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls. The\nout-of-pocket costs, diversion of management’s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of\nSection 404 have been significant, and we expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with our compliance efforts. If we fail to comply with the requirements of\nSection 404, or if we or our auditors identify and report any material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially\nadversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of\ncustomers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, subject us to investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities and require additional expenditures to comply with these\nrequirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n21\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, which limits the ability of holders of\nour Class A common stock to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of November 20, 2024, our outstanding Class B common stock\nrepresented approximately 65.5% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock. The shares of Class B common stock are owned primarily by (i) SunTx Capital\nPartners, a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas (“SunTx”), and funds that it manages, (ii) SunTx principals and their respective affiliates and family members, and (iii) certain\nmembers of management and our board of directors. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and our Class A common stock, the holders of our\nClass B common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore control the outcome of all matters submitted to our\nstockholders. This concentrated control limits or precludes the ability of holders of Class A common stock to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Future transfers\nof shares of our Class B common stock generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, with limited exceptions. The conversion of shares of\nour Class B common stock into our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of each remaining share of Class B common\nstock.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of Class A common stock by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nAs of November 20, 2024, we had outstanding a total of 46,963,255 shares of Class A common stock and 8,914,045 shares of Class B common stock that are convertible at any\ntime into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock. The sale of shares of Class A common stock, or the perception of future sales by us or our existing stockholders,\ncould harm the prevailing market price of shares of Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell\nequity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We have in the past, and we may in the future, issue our securities in connection with offerings or\nacquisitions, and the number of shares issued or issuable thereafter could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Any such issuance\nwould result in dilution to holders of Class A common stock.\nSunTx, together with its principals and their respective affiliates and family members (collectively, the “SunTx Group”), controls us, and their interests may conflict with ours\nor yours in the future.\nAs of November 20, 2024, the SunTx Group beneficially owned approximately 1.0% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 79.0% of our outstanding Class\nB common stock, representing approximately 52.1% of the combined voting power of our common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and\neach share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As a result, the SunTx Group has the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby\ncontrol our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any,\non our Class A common stock, our ability to incur or issue debt, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and our\nentry into extraordinary transactions. This concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of our Class A common stock\nas part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in\nrelated party transactions involving the SunTx Group and certain companies controlled by its members. As a result, the interests of the SunTx Group may not in all cases be aligned\nwith your interests.\nIn addition, the SunTx Group may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such\ntransactions might involve risks to you. For example, the SunTx Group could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating\nassets. SunTx is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of SunTx, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have\nany duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The SunTx Group also\nmay pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSo long as the SunTx Group continues to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, it will continue to be able to effectively control our\ndecisions, even if the number of shares of outstanding Class B common stock is limited in proportion to the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Shares of our\nClass B common stock may be transferred to an unrelated third party if holders of a majority of the shares of our Class B common stock owned by SunTx and its affiliates consent\nto such transfer in writing in advance.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such\ndesignations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors\nmay determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we\nmight grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or upon the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified\ntransactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nProvisions in our governing documents and Delaware corporate law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our Company, which could adversely affect the price\nof our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control\nof our Company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain\nprovisions that may make acquiring control of our Company difficult, including:\n• a dual class common stock structure, which currently provides the SunTx Group and the other holders of our Class B common stock with the ability to control the outcome\nof matters requiring stockholder approval, so long as they continue to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of our Class B common stock, even if they own\nsignificantly less than 50% of the total number of shares of our outstanding common stock;\n• a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms;\n• provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n• limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting;\n• the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting\npower of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our amended and restated bylaws;\n• the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove\ndirectors or amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation; and\n• the authority of our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these\nprovisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay for\nshares of our Class A common stock.\nOur governing documents designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which\ncould limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, state courts within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the\nState of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any: (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on\nour behalf; (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) action asserting a claim\nagainst us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine,\nand that if any action specified above is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will\nbe deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court\nto enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (b) having service of process made upon such claiming party by service upon such claiming party’s counsel in the\nforeign action as agent for such claiming party. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, the federal district courts of the United States are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action\narising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). These provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively,\nif a court were to\n23\nTable of Contents\nfind these provisions inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other\njurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nBecause we are a “controlled company” under the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the rules of the SEC, our stockholders do not have, and may never\nhave, certain corporate governance protections that are available to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.\nThe SunTx Group controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the listing standards of The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC and SEC rules. As a controlled company, we are not required to comply with certain provisions requiring that (i) a majority of our directors be independent, (ii)\nthe compensation of our executives be determined by independent directors or (iii) nominees for election to our board of directors be selected by independent directors. Because we\nintend to continue to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have the protections that these rules are intended to provide. Our status as a\ncontrolled company could cause our Class A common stock to be less attractive to certain investors or otherwise reduce the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation, if any, of the price of our Class A common\nstock will provide a return to our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will\nbe at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects\nand other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends. As a result, only appreciation of the price\nof our Class A common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs part of our enterprise risk management function, we have implemented processes to assess, identify and manage the material risks facing our company, including risks from\ncybersecurity threats. Our enterprise risk management function represents our overall risk management system. Our cybersecurity program is built upon recognized security\nframeworks. We believe that our processes provide us with a comprehensive assessment of potential cybersecurity threats. We conduct regular scans, penetration tests, and\nvulnerability assessments to identify any potential threats or vulnerabilities in our systems. Our processes to assess, identify and manage the material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats include the risks arising from threats associated with third-party service providers, including cloud-based platforms.\nWe have developed a cybersecurity incident response plan that provides a documented framework for handling cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple\nparts of the Company. Dedicated members of our information security team, led by our Senior Vice President, Information Technology and our Director of Information Security,\ncontinuously monitor threat intelligence feeds, handle vulnerability management and respond to incidents. In addition, we periodically perform simulations and drills at a technical\nlevel.\nInternally, we have a security awareness training platform that includes training to reinforce our information technology and security policies, standards and practices, and we\nrequire that our employees comply with these policies. The cybersecurity awareness training platform offers training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect our\nresources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests.\nFrom time to time, we engage third-party service providers to enhance our risk mitigation efforts. For instance, we have engaged an independent cybersecurity advisor to evaluate\nour cybersecurity controls and a cybersecurity firm to conduct continuous threat detection, response and remediation.\nTo date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, and we currently do\nnot expect that the risks from cybersecurity threats are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nHowever, as discussed more fully under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” cybersecurity attacks are continually evolving to become more sophisticated and, while we have invested in the\nprotection of our data and information technology to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident, our efforts may not be effective in preventing breakdowns or breaches in our\nsystems.\n24\nTable of Contents\nGovernance\nRole of the Board. Our board of directors exercises direct oversight of our strategic risks through its oversight of our enterprise risk management function. The Audit Committee of\nthe board of directors in particular is responsible for overseeing our IT security controls and the adequacy of our IT security program, compliance and controls with management.\nAs part of such oversight, the board of directors, including members of the Audit Committee, receive periodic reports from management and our third-party service providers to\nassess the primary cybersecurity risks we face.\nRole of Management. Our Senior Vice President, Information Technology and our Director of Information Security are together responsible for the day-to-day management of our\ncybersecurity risks. These professionals have extensive experience in the information technology area, including cybersecurity. In particular, our Senior Vice President, Information\nTechnology has more than 30 years of professional experience in the field of management information systems and information security, including with other companies in our\nindustry. Further, our Director of Information Security has more than 20 years of experience in the information security area, with a career spanning roles with the U.S. Air Force,\nhealthcare, academia and private consulting, and holds various certifications related to cybersecurity.\nSecurity Incident Response Plan. We have a security incident response plan in place. The incident response plan is a set of coordinated procedures that our incident response team\nexecutes with the goal of ensuring timely and accurate resolution of cybersecurity incidents.\nItem 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive office is located in Dothan, Alabama, in a building that we own. As of November 20, 2024, we operated (i) 84 HMA plants in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, (ii) 17 aggregates facilities in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Texas and (iii) three liquid asphalt terminals in Alabama,\nFlorida and Texas. Our HMA plants operate at varying levels of utilization depending on market conditions. We maintain offices at our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and\nterminals as we determine to be appropriate under the circumstances. We consider our plants and other physical properties, whether owned or leased, to be suitable, adequate, and of\nsufficient productive capacity to meet the requirements of our business. However, we routinely evaluate the purchase or lease of additional properties or the consolidation of our\nproperties as our business needs change.\nThe table below summarizes the locations and the nature of our ownership or leasehold interest in each of our HMA plants, aggregates facilities and liquid asphalt terminals as of\nNovember 20, 2024.\nHMA Plants Aggregates Facilities Liquid Asphalt Terminals\nLocation Owned Leased Owned Leased Owned Leased\nAlabama 8 6 6 3 1 —\nFlorida 10 2 1 — 1 —\nGeorgia 9 3 1 2 — —\nNorth Carolina 12 11 — — — —\nSouth Carolina 4 6 — — — —\nTennessee — 3 — — — —\nTexas 7 3 3 1 1 —\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nDue to the nature of our business, we are involved in routine litigation or subject to other disputes or claims related to our business activities, including, among other things, (i)\nworkers’ compensation claims, (ii) employment-related disputes and (iii) liability issues or breach of contract or tortious conduct claims in connection with the performance of\nservices and provision of materials. We and our affiliates are also subject to government inquiries in the ordinary course of business seeking information concerning our compliance\nwith government construction contracting requirements and various laws and regulations, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty. In the opinion of our\nmanagement, after consultation with legal counsel, none of the pending inquiries, litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely to us, would have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nThe information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nand Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 C.F.R.

The actual number of beneficial holders of\nour Class A common stock is significantly greater than the number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held by banks,\nbrokers and other nominees. The last sale price for a share of our Class A common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 20, 2024 was $91.31.\nAs of November 20, 2024, there were 8,914,045 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, held by 40 stockholders of record.\nDividends\nHolders of our Class A and Class B common stock receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors out of legally available funds. We do not anticipate declaring or\npaying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and\nwill depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors\nthat our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the Credit Agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends to the holders of our common stock unless, after giving\neffect to such dividend, we would remain in compliance with the financial covenants and, at the time any such dividend is made, no default or event of default exists or would result\nfrom the payment of such dividend.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThere were no sales of unregistered equity securities during the period covered by this report that were not previously reported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current\nReport on Form 8-K.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nApproximate dollar value of\nTotal number of shares shares that may yet be\nTotal number of Average price purchased as part of publicly purchased under the plans\nPeriod shares purchased paid per share announced plans or programs or programs (1)\nJuly 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024 44,002 $ 57.62 44,002 $ 32,194,980\nAugust 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024 36,331 $ 59.82 36,331 $ 30,021,791\nSeptember 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 — $ — — $ 30,021,791\nTotal 80,333 $ 58.60 80,333\n(1) In April 2024, the board of directors authorized the Company to purchase up to $40.0 million of our Class A common stock in open market purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions or by other means.

[Reserved]\n27\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in understanding and assessing the trends and significant changes in our\nresults of operations and financial condition. Historical results may not be indicative of future performance. This discussion includes forward-looking statements that reflect our\nplans, estimates and beliefs. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those set forth under the headings “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” This discussion\nshould be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. In this discussion, we use certain non-\nGAAP financial measures. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in\nthis “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as\nsubstitutes for financial information presented in compliance with GAAP.\nOverview\nWe are a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the building and maintenance of transportation networks. Our operations leverage a highly-skilled workforce, strategically\nlocated HMA plants, substantial construction assets and select material deposits. We provide construction products and services to both public and private infrastructure projects,\nwith an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential sites throughout the Sunbelt in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee and Texas.\nOur public projects are funded by federal, state and local governments and include roads, highways, bridges, airports and other forms of infrastructure. Public transportation\ninfrastructure projects historically have been a relatively stable portion of state and federal budgets and represent a significant share of the United States construction market.\nFederal funds are allocated on a state-by-state basis, and each state is required to match a portion of the federal funds that it receives. Federal highway spending uses funds\npredominantly from the Highway Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from fuel taxes and other user fees.\nIn addition to public infrastructure projects, we provide a wide range of large site work construction and HMA paving services to private construction customers, including\ncommercial and residential developers and local businesses.\nRecent Developments\nContract Backlog\nAt September 30, 2024, our contract backlog was $2.0 billion. Contract backlog is a financial measure that reflects the dollar value of work that the Company expects to perform in\nthe future. We include a construction project in our contract backlog at the time it is awarded and to the extent we believe funding is probable. Our backlog consists of uncompleted\nwork on contracts in progress and contracts for which we have executed a contract but have not commenced the work. For uncompleted work on contracts in progress, we include\n(i) executed change orders, (ii) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmation in the ordinary course of business and (iii) claims that we have made against our\ncustomers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider collection to be probable. Backlog of\nuncompleted work on contracts under which work was either in progress or had not yet begun was $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024. Our contract backlog also includes low\nbid/no contract projects, which consist of (i) public bid projects for which we were the low bidder and no contract has been executed and (ii) private work projects for which we\nhave been notified that we are the low bidder or have been given a notice to proceed, but no contract has been executed. Low bid/no contract backlog was $0.5 billion at September\n30, 2024.\n2024 Fiscal Year Business Acquisitions\nDuring the 2024 fiscal year, we completed eight acquisitions across four states, adding to or expanding our operations in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. As\na result of these acquisitions, we added eleven asphalt plants and a diverse fleet of equipment and vehicles, as well as skilled construction professionals. For further discussion\nregarding these transactions, see Note 4 - Business Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nLone Star Paving Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding membership units of Asphalt, Inc., LLC (doing business as Lone Star Paving) (“Lone Star Paving” and the acquisition, the\n“Lone Star Acquisition”), a vertically integrated asphalt manufacturing and paving company headquartered in Austin, Texas, with 10 HMA plants, four aggregate facilities, and one\nliquid asphalt terminal supporting its operations. The aggregate consideration delivered at the closing of the Lone Star Acquisition consisted of (i) $654.2 million in cash (as\nadjusted pursuant to the Unit Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 20, 2024, by and among the Company, Lone Star Paving, the selling unit holders party thereto, and John J.\nWheeler, in his capacity as the selling unit holders’ representative thereunder) and (ii) 3.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, we agreed to (i) pay cash to the\nselling unit holders in\n28\nTable of Contents\nan amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone Star Paving at closing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification\nobligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out in quarterly installments over four quarters following the closing, and (ii) purchase from the selling unit holders\nfor $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real property following receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from\nthe proceeds of the Term Loan B (as defined below). For more information about the Lone Star Acquisition, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this report.\nTerm Loan B Credit Agreement\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, BofA Securities, Inc., PNC Capital Markets LLC,\nRegions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, and TD Securities (USA) LLC, each as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner, and certain other lenders party thereto (the\n“Term Loan B Credit Agreement”). The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $850.0\nmillion, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of the\nconsideration for the Lone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan\nproceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement (as\ndefined below), (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other\ncorporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. For more information about the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCredit Agreement Amendments\nIn May 2024, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a Third Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to\ntime, the “Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from $325.0 million to\n$400.0 million, (ii) reallocate $125.0 million of borrowings previously outstanding under the revolving credit facility to our term loan, (iii) add three new banks to our lender\nsyndicate, (iv) provide for an additional incremental credit facility of up to $200.0 million and (v) update certain affirmative and negative covenants thereunder. Additionally, on\nOctober 30, 2024, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star Acquisition, (ii) entry\ninto the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement on a pari passu basis\nwith the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement. For further discussion regarding the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit\nAgreement and the foregoing amendments, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn April 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40 million is available to purchase shares of our outstanding Class A common\nstock through September 30, 2025. We utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under our equity incentive plans and to repurchase\nshares opportunistically. Shares of our Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated\ntransactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any shares\nof Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any time by our board of directors. The actual timing, number\nand value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased are determined by a committee of the board of directors at its discretion and depend on a number of factors, including the\nmarket price of our Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we\nrepurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nSeasonality\nThe activity of our business fluctuates due to seasonality because our business is primarily conducted outdoors. Therefore, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions, in\nparticular extended snowy, rainy or cold weather and major weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms and heavy snows, can adversely affect our business and\noperations through a decline in both the use of our products and the demand for our services. In addition, construction materials production and shipment levels follow activity in\nthe construction industry, which typically occurs in the spring, summer and fall. Warmer and drier weather during our third and fourth fiscal quarters typically result in higher\nactivity and revenues during the second half of our fiscal year. Our first and second fiscal quarters typically have lower levels of activity due to adverse weather conditions. Our\nthird fiscal quarter varies greatly with spring rains and wide temperature variations. A cool, wet spring increases drying time on projects, which can delay revenues in the third fiscal\nquarter, while a warm, dry spring may facilitate earlier project commencement dates.\n29\nTable of Contents\nHow We Assess Performance of Our Business\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues predominantly by providing construction products and services for both public and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads,\nbridges, airports and commercial and residential sites in the southeastern United States. Our projects represent a mix of federal, state, municipal and private customers. We also\nderive revenues from the sale of HMA, aggregates and liquid asphalt cement to customers. We recognize revenues derived from projects as we satisfy our performance obligations\nover time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost\ninput method). Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may\nresult in revisions to estimated costs and income, and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Revenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates and\nliquid asphalt cement are recognized when the risks associated with ownership have passed to the customer.\nGross Profit\nGross profit represents revenues less cost of revenues. Cost of revenues consists of all direct and indirect costs associated with construction contracts, including raw materials, labor,\nequipment costs, depreciation, lease expenses, subcontract costs and other expenses at our HMA plants, aggregates mining facilities and liquid asphalt cement terminal. Our cost of\nrevenues is directly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, primarily liquid asphalt and diesel fuel. From time to time, when appropriate, we limit our exposure to changes in\ncommodity prices by entering into forward purchase commitments. In addition, our public infrastructure contracts often provide for price adjustments based on fluctuations in\ncertain commodity-related product costs. These price adjustment provisions are in place for most of our public infrastructure contracts, and we seek to include similar provisions in\nour private contracts.\nDepreciation, Depletion, Accretion and Amortization\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired as a business combination, at fair value. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is computed on a\nstraight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense is the periodic expense related to leasehold improvements, intangible assets and liabilities.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the underlying asset or the remaining lease term. Our intangible assets and liabilities were recognized as a result\nof certain acquisitions and are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities. Mineral reserves are depleted in accordance\nwith the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs related to our operational offices that are not allocated to direct contract costs and expenses related to our corporate offices.\nThese expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our administration, finance and accounting, legal, information systems, human resources and certain managerial\nemployees. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition expenses, audit, consulting and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, travel, insurance,\noffice space rental costs, property taxes and other corporate and overhead expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn the normal course of business, we sell construction equipment for various reasons, including when the cost of maintaining the asset exceeds the cost of replacing it. The gain or\nloss on the sale of property, plant and equipment reflects the difference between the carrying value at the date of disposal and the net consideration received from the sale of\nequipment during the period.\nGain on Facility Exchange\nAs part of our continued growth strategy, we may exchange or sell facilities in order to generate capital for use in connection with other strategic initiatives. The gain or loss on the\nexchange or sale of a facility reflects the difference between the net carrying value of the facility at the date of disposal and the consideration received from the exchange or sale\nduring the period.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net primarily represents interest incurred on our long-term debt, such as the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the changes in fair values of\ninterest swap agreements and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. These amounts are partially offset by interest income earned on short-term investments of cash balances\nin excess of our current operating needs.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOther Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before, as applicable from time to time, (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, depletion,\naccretion and amortization, (iv) share-based compensation expense, (v) loss on the extinguishment of debt, and (vi) expenses associated with non-routine acquisitions. Adjusted\nEBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues for each period. These metrics are supplemental measures of our operating performance that are neither\nrequired by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net\nincome or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin because management uses these measures as key performance indicators, and we believe that securities analysts, investors and others use these measures to evaluate\ncompanies in our industry. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may not be comparable to similarly named measures reported by other companies.\nPotential differences may include differences in capital structures, tax positions and the age and book depreciation of intangible and tangible assets.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation\nof Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the periods presented (in thousands, except percentages):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023 (2)\nNet income $ 68,935 $ 49,001\nInterest expense, net 19,071 17,346\nProvision for income taxes 23,161 16,403\nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization 92,920 79,100\nShare-based compensation expense 15,031 10,759\nAcquisition-related expenses (1) 1,455 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 220,573 $ 172,609\nRevenues $ 1,823,889 $ 1,563,548\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin 12.1 % 11.0 %\n(1) Reflects expenses associated with the Lone Star Acquisition, which management views as a non-routine acquisition.\n(2) In periods commencing prior to September 30, 2023, we historically included within the definition of Adjusted EBITDA an adjustment for management fees and expenses\nrelated to our management services agreement with an affiliate of SunTx Capital Partners, a member of our control group. Effective October 1, 2023, the term of the\nmanagement services agreement was extended to October 1, 2028. As a result of the term extension, we no longer view the management fees and expenses paid under the\nmanagement services agreement as a non-recurring expense. Accordingly, periods commencing subsequent to September 30, 2023 do not include an adjustment for\nmanagement fees and expenses, and we have recast comparative Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to conform\nto the current definition.\n31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations — Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”) and September 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) (in thousands, except\npercentages). Refer to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 29, 2023, for a discussion of results for\nfiscal 2023 and a comparison of our financial results for fiscal 2023 to those for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\nChange from Fiscal\n2024 2023 2023 to Fiscal 2024\n% of % of %\nDollars Revenues Dollars Revenues $ Change Change\nRevenues $ 1,823,889 100.0 % $ 1,563,548 100.0 % $ 260,341 16.7 %\nCost of revenues 1,565,635 85.8 % 1,367,163 87.4 % 198,472 14.5 %\nGross profit 258,254 14.2 % 196,385 12.6 % 61,869 31.5 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses (151,497) (8.3)% (126,947) (8.1)% (24,550) 19.3 %\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment 4,483 0.2 % 7,048 0.5 % (2,565) (36.4)%\nGain on facility exchange — — % 5,389 0.3 % (5,389) (100.0)%\nOperating income 111,240 6.1 % 81,875 5.3 % 29,365 35.9 %\nInterest expense, net (19,071) (1.0)% (17,346) (1.1)% (1,725) 9.9 %\nOther (expense) income (70) — % 875 — % (945) (108.0)%\nIncome before provision for income taxes and earnings\nfrom investment in joint venture 92,099 5.1 % 65,404 4.2 % 26,695 40.8 %\nProvision for income taxes 23,161 1.3 % 16,403 1.0 % 6,758 41.2 %\nLoss from investment in\njoint venture (3) — % — — % (3) — %\nNet income $ 68,935 3.8 % $ 49,001 3.1 % $ 19,934 40.7 %\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 220,573 12.1 % $ 172,609 11.0 % $ 47,964 27.8 %\nRevenues. Revenues for fiscal 2024 increased $260.3 million, or 16.7%, to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion for fiscal 2023. The increase included $154.0 million of revenues\nattributable to acquisitions completed during or subsequent to fiscal 2023 and an increase of approximately $106.3 million of revenues in our existing markets from contract work\nand sales of HMA and aggregates to third parties. The 6.8% increase in revenue in our existing markets was due to strong demand in both public and private work.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2024 increased $61.9 million, or 31.5%, to $258.3 million from $196.4 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily the\nresult of the 16.7% increase in revenues for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and a higher gross profit margin. The higher gross profit margin was due to (i) efficient utilization of\nour plants and equipment fleet and (ii) completion of new backlog with more favorable margins.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 increased $24.6 million, or 19.3%, to $151.5 million from $126.9 million for fiscal\n2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was the result of (i) an $8.1 million increase attributable to general and\nadministrative expenses associated with the operations of businesses acquired subsequent to September 30, 2023, (ii) a $6.6 million increase in management personnel payroll and\nbenefits, (iii) a $4.3 million increase in share-based compensation expense, and (iv) a $5.6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\nGain on Sale of Property, Plant and Equipment. Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2024 decreased $2.6 million, or 36.4%, to $4.5 million from $7.0 million\nfor fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of a $1.3 million gain on the sale of an excess office building and higher disposals of equipment and components during fiscal\n2023.\nGain on Facility Exchange. There was no gain on facility exchange for fiscal 2024 compared to a gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million for fiscal 2023. The gain in fiscal 2023\nwas the result of the disposition of a quarry in North Carolina. In connection with\n32\nTable of Contents\nthis transaction, we acquired three HMA manufacturing plants and certain related assets located in the Nashville, Tennessee metro area.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net for fiscal 2024 increased $1.7 million, or 9.9%, to $19.1 million compared to $17.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in interest\nexpense, net was primarily due to an increase in the average principal debt balance outstanding.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate was 25.1% for fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.\nNet Income. Net income increased $19.9 million, or 40.7%, to $68.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $49.0 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in net income was primarily a\nresult of higher gross profit, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense and decreased gains from the facility exchange and sales of\nproperty, plant and equipment, all as described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin were $220.6 million and 12.1%, respectively, for fiscal 2024, compared to\n$172.6 million and 11.0%, respectively, for fiscal 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin resulted primarily from a $19.9 million increase in net\nincome and a $13.8 million increase in depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization. For a description of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, as well as a\nreconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see above under the heading “How We Assess Performance of Our Business — Other Key Performance Indicators — Adjusted\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows Analysis\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year\nEnded September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions $ 209,079 $ 157,157\nNet cash used in investing activities (307,585) (143,372)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities 126,110 (264)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 27,604 $ 13,521\nOperating Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $209.1 million, primarily as a result of:\n• net income of $68.9 million, reflecting, among other things, $92.9 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $22.7 million,\nshare-based compensation expense of $14.4 million, and gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $4.5 million;\n• an increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $6.6 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\n• an increase in inventories of $15.5 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our\ninventory cycle;\n• an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $13.0 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\n• an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $18.3 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\n• a net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on\nuncompleted contracts of $30.4 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\n33\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash provided by operating activities, net of acquisitions, was $157.2 million, primarily as a result of:\n• net income of $49.0 million, reflecting, among other things, $79.1 million of depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, deferred income taxes of $11.2 million,\nshare-based compensation expense of $10.8 million, gain on sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.0 million, and gain on facility exchange of $5.4 million;\n• an increase in contracts receivable including retainage of $26.0 million as a result of higher overall revenues due to acquisitions and growth in existing markets;\n• an increase in inventories of $7.3 million due to increased inventories from acquisitions, growth in existing markets, higher inventory costs and normal fluctuations in our\ninventory cycle;\n• a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $3.7 million, primarily due to the timing of payments under our insurance policies and other expenses;\n• an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of $19.6 million due to an increase in construction activity; and\n• a net increase in the difference between billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on\nuncompleted contracts of $26.7 million due to the timing of performing and closing projects.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash used in investing activities was $307.6 million, of which $231.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $87.9 million was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment and $5.5 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $14.1 million of proceeds from the sale of equipment\nand $3.6 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in investing activities was $143.4 million, of which $91.8 million related to acquisitions completed in the period, $97.8 million was invested in\nproperty, plant and equipment and $11.4 million was invested in restricted investments. These amounts were partially offset by $17.7 million of proceeds from the sale of\nequipment, $37.0 million of proceeds from the facility exchange and $2.9 million of proceeds from the sale of restricted investments.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $126.1 million. We received $210.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs\nand discounts, which was partially offset by $72.8 million of principal payments on long-term debt and purchase of treasury stock of $11.3 million.\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash used in financing activities was $0.3 million. We received $103.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and\ndiscounts, which was offset by $103.1 million of principal payments on long-term debt and the purchase of treasury stock of $0.2 million.\nTerm Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement\nDuring fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, we and each of our subsidiaries were parties to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, which provides for the Term Loan A and the\nRevolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had $392.2 million and $283.8 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Term Loan A, $122.9\nmillion and $93.1 million, respectively, of principal outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, and availability of $268.8 million and $222.1 million, respectively, under the\nRevolving Credit Facility, including reduction for outstanding letters of credit. The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility are\nsecured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nThe Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.20-to-1.00 and a maximum\nconsolidated leverage ratio of 3.50-to-1.00, subject to certain adjustments. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, our fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.15-to-1.00 and 2.56-to-1.00,\nrespectively, and our consolidated leverage ratio was 1.81-to-1.00 and 1.72-to-1.00, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the risk of changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate notional\nvalue of these interest rate swap agreements was $300.0 million, and the fair value was $11.6 million and $26.9 million, respectively, which is included within other assets on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFor more information about the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, see Note 11 - Debt and Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this report.\nTerm Loan B Credit Agreement\nOn November 1, 2024, we entered into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of\n$850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024. A portion of the proceeds of the Term B Loan was used to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the\nLone Star Acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at closing. The remaining loan proceeds were or will be\nused (i) to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay fees and\nexpenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and other corporate purposes as permitted by\nthe Term Loan B Credit Agreement.\nFor more information about the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, see Note 27 - Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nDuring fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our capital expenditures were approximately $87.9 million and $97.8 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures are typically made during\nthe same fiscal year in which they are approved. At September 30, 2024, our commitments for capital expenditures were not material to our financial condition or results of\noperations on a consolidated basis. For fiscal 2025, we expect total capital expenditures to be $130.0 million to $140.0 million. Our capital expenditure budget is an estimate and is\nsubject to change.\nHistorically, we have required significant amounts of cash in order to make capital expenditures, purchase materials and fund our organic expansion into new markets. Our working\ncapital needs are driven by the seasonality and growth of our business, with our cash requirements increasing in periods of growth. Additional cash requirements resulting from our\ngrowth include the costs of additional personnel, production and distribution facilities, enhancements to our information systems, integration costs related to any acquisitions and\nour compliance with laws and rules applicable to public companies.\nFurthermore, on April 12, 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which up to $40.0 million is available to purchase shares of\nour outstanding Class A common stock through September 30, 2025. We intend to utilize the stock repurchase program to minimize the dilutive impact of awards granted under\nour equity incentive plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. Shares of Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions at\nprevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock repurchase\nprogram does not obligate us to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated at any\ntime by our board of directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased will be determined by a committee of the board of directors at\nits discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Class A common stock, capital allocation alternatives, general market and economic\nconditions and other corporate considerations. During fiscal 2024, we repurchased a total of 173,741 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0\nmillion.\nWe have typically relied on cash available through credit facilities, in addition to cash from operations, to finance our working capital requirements and to support our growth. We\nregularly monitor potential capital sources, including equity and debt markets, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity requirements. Our future success\nwill depend on our ability to access outside sources of capital.\nWe believe that our operating cash flow and available borrowings under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement and the Term Loan B Credit Agreement (together, the\n“Credit Agreements”) will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number\nof variables, including the potential impacts of inflation and supply chain constraints, and significant additional capital expenditures will be required to conduct our operations. Our\noperations and other capital resources may not provide sufficient cash to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. In the event that we make one or more\nacquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount of cash on hand we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the\nexpected level of capital expenditures and/or seek additional capital. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through borrowings under the Credit Agreements, joint ventures,\nasset sales, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. However, our ability to engage in any such transactions may be constrained by economic conditions and other\nfactors outside of our control. Additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain the funds we need, we may not be able to complete\nacquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures necessary to conduct our operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had aggregate letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $8.3 million, future purchase commitments for diesel fuel and natural gas of\n$4.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and $2.2 million of minimum royalty payments related to mineral leases at aggregates facilities. Other than the letters of credit, future\npurchase commitments and minimum royalty payments, we do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current\nor future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\n2029 and\nTotal 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter\nDebt obligations $ 515,038 $ 26,563 $ 31,875 $ 456,600 $ — $ — $ —\nOperating leases 44,892 11,067 10,702 9,954 6,186 2,366 4,617\nPurchase commitments 4,457 3,193 1,264 — — — —\nRoyalty payments 2,243 256 192 180 145 145 1,325\nAsset retirement obligations 2,477 — — — — — 2,477\nTotal $ 569,107 $ 41,079 $ 44,033 $ 466,734 $ 6,331 $ 2,511 $ 8,419\nIn addition to the items set forth in the table above, subsequent to September 30, 2024 and in connection with the Lone Star Acquisition, we entered into a conditional purchase\nagreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase from the sellers of Lone Star Paving, upon the receipt of certain permits and governmental entitlements, an entity that owns\ncertain real property located in central Texas for aggregate consideration of $30.0 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The\npreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates\nand assumptions on an ongoing basis. The results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and the impact of such differences may be material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those policies that, in management’s view, are the most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. The notes to\nthe consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting\npolicies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. These critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level\nof estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition are discussed further below.\n36\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, we are committed to providing materials or services required by a\ncontract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). Our private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also known as lump sum\ncontracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Revenues from fixed unit price and fixed total price construction contracts are recognized as\nperformance obligations are satisfied over time (formerly known as the percentage-of-completion method), measured by the relationship of total cost incurred compared to total\nestimated contract costs (cost-to-cost input method). Under this method, revenues are recognized as costs are incurred in an amount equal to cost plus the related expected profit\nbased on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated final costs. This cost-to-cost method is used because management considers it to be the best available measure of progress on these\ncontracts. Contract costs consist of direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, amounts payable to subcontractors and those indirect costs related to contract performance,\nsuch as equipment costs, insurance and employee benefits. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenues and cost estimates are reflected in the accounting\nperiod when known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job\nconditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from contract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs\nand income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract without adding new provisions or terms. Change orders may\ninclude changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of completion of the work. Either we or our customers may\ninitiate change orders. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which we have a change of scope for which we believe we are contractually entitled to a\nhigher price, but where a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon with the customer. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are\nincluded in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred. We recognize revenues equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders\nwhen realization of price approval is probable. Unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates, and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and\nrecoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers. Change orders that are unapproved as to both\nprice and scope are evaluated as claims. We consider claims to be amounts in excess of agreed contract prices that we seek to collect from our customers or others for customer-\ncaused delays, errors in specifications and designs, contract terminations, change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price, or other causes of\nunanticipated additional contract costs. Claims are included in the calculation of revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined. To support these\nrequirements, the existence of the following items must be satisfied: (i) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim or a legal opinion has been obtained,\nstating that, under the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis to support the claim; (ii) additional costs are caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and\nare not the result of deficiencies in our performance; (iii) costs associated with the claim are identifiable or otherwise determinable and are reasonable in view of the work\nperformed; and (iv) the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable, not based on management’s subjective evaluation of the situation or on unsupported\nrepresentations. Revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized when an agreement is reached with the customer as to the value of the claim, which, in some\ninstances, may not occur until after completion of work under the contract. Costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated\nas project costs when incurred.\nFor the majority of our contracts, we receive our final payment when projects are near completion or fully completed. The accuracy of our revenues and profit recognition in a given\nperiod depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the revenues and costs to finish uncompleted contracts. Our estimates for all of our significant contracts use a highly detailed\n“bottom up” approach. However, our projects can be highly complex and, in almost every case, the profit margin estimates for a contract will either increase or decrease to some\nextent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid. Because we have a large number of projects of varying sizes and levels of complexity in process at any\ngiven time, these changes in estimates can sometimes offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability. However, large changes in revenues or cost estimates\ncan have a significant effect on profitability.\nThe accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period depends on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project. Cost estimates for all of our\nprojects use a detailed approach, and we believe our experience allows us to create materially reliable estimates. There are a number of factors that can contribute to changes in\nestimates of contract cost and profitability. The most significant of these include:\n• the completeness and accuracy of the original bid;\n• costs associated with scope changes;\n• changes in costs of labor and/or materials;\n• extended overhead and other costs due to owner, weather and other delays;\n37\nTable of Contents\n• subcontractor performance issues;\n• changes in productivity expectations;\n• site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid;\n• changes from original design on design-build projects;\n• the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;\n• a change in the availability and proximity of equipment and materials;\n• our ability to fully and promptly recover on affirmative claims and back charges for additional contract costs; and\n• the customer’s ability to properly administer the contract.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the stage of completion of contracts in process and the mix of contracts at different margins, may cause fluctuations in gross profit between\nperiods, and these fluctuations may be significant.\nContracts Receivable, Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed to the customer and currently due in accordance with our contracts. Many of the contracts under which we perform work\ncontain retainage provisions. Retainage refers to amounts earned by the Company but held by customers until contracts are near completion or fully completed. Retainage on active\ncontracts is classified as a current asset regardless of the term of the contract and is generally collected within one year of the completion of a contract. At September 30, 2024 and\n2023, contracts receivable included $52.7 million and $53.3 million, respectively, of retainage.\nBecause the majority of our construction contracts are entered into with federal, state or municipal government customers, credit risk is minimal. We confirm that funds have been\nappropriated by the government project owner prior to commencing work on such projects. While most of our public contracts are subject to termination at the election of the\ngovernment entity, in the event of any such termination, we are entitled to receive the contract price for completed work and reimbursement of termination-related costs. Credit risk\nwith private customers is minimized because of statutory mechanic’s liens, which give us high priority in the event of lien foreclosures following financial difficulties of private\ncustomers. We maintain an allowance for credit losses, which has historically been sufficient to cover accounts that are not collected.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and acquired intangible assets, such as goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Impairment evaluations involve fair values and management estimates of\nuseful asset lives and future cash flows. Actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management, and this could have a material effect on our\noperating results and financial position. For fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, there were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a material impairment of our long-\nlived assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. We performed our most recent annual impairment test on July 1, 2024. Our test\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. For our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate our market capitalization compared to\nthe net assets of the Company overall. Our final determination of valuation is impacted by a number of factors, but the key factors are the price of our common stock, recently\ncompleted transactions from both public companies and private transactions and our estimated forecast of future cash flows.\nThe valuation approaches contain uncertainty regarding the estimates used. Our market capitalization could be impacted because we are a controlled company, which impacts the\ncontrol premium we apply to the market price of our common stock. One of the largest uncertainties relates to federal, state and local government spending, which management\nexpects to continue to increase in the coming years. There are a number of other uncertainties with respect to our future financial performance that could impact estimated future\ncash flows, including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report. Based on our valuation approaches, we determined that our one reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired at July 1, 2024 or 2023. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had goodwill\nwith a carrying amount of $231.7 million and $159.3 million, respectively.\nFor our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment,\nand it was determined that is more likely than not the indefinite-lived name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or\nperformed.\n38\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of\ninventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to\ncustomers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including\nasphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled\n$95.8 million and $75.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $10.9 million and $8.5 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly\nreview our deferred tax assets for recoverability and, where necessary, establish a valuation allowance. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if we\ndetermine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods.\nTo assess this likelihood, we use historical three-year results of operations, estimates and judgments regarding our future taxable income and consider the jurisdiction in which the\ntaxable income is generated to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence can include our current financial position, results of operations, actual and\nforecasted results, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and the current and forecasted business economics of our industry. Additionally, we record uncertain\ntax positions at their net recognizable amount, based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities\nin jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOn the basis of our evaluations, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, no valuation allowance was recorded on our net deferred tax assets, and we had no material uncertain tax\npositions. If our estimates or assumptions regarding our current and deferred tax items are inaccurate or are modified, these changes could have potentially material impacts on our\nearnings.\nAccrued Insurance Cost\nWe carry insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which we are liable to reimburse the\ninsurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, Construction Partners Risk Management, Inc., a captive insurance company and wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the Company, has retained the first $1,000,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. Also effective October 1, 2021, we became a member of a group captive\ninsurance company that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid. We utilize various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims\nin excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by changes in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect\non our operating results and financial position up to $1,000,000 per occurrence for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. Prior to October 1,\n2021, the amount for which we were liable for general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims ranged from $100,000 to $500,000 per occurrence.\nManagement accrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historic trends modified, if\nnecessary, by recent events.\nWe provide employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the insurance company.\nUnder the self-insured policies, we are liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. We purchase separate stop-loss insurance, which\nlimits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000.\nShare-Based Payments and Other Equity Transactions\nOur equity incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. We account for awards issued under our equity incentive plan using a fair\nvalue-based method of accounting, whereby compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period, which is\ntypically the vesting period.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of our short- and long-term debt obligations used to finance our operations and acquisitions. We have SOFR-based floating rate\nborrowings under the Credit Agreements, which expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in the reference interest rates. From time to time, we use derivative\ninstruments as hedges against the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings and cash flows. We do not enter into such derivative instruments for speculative or trading\npurposes.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a total of $515.0 million of variable rate borrowings outstanding. Holding other factors constant and absent the interest rate swap agreements\ndescribed above, a hypothetical 1% change in our borrowing rates would result in a $5.2 million change in our annual interest expense based on our variable rate debt outstanding\nat September 30, 2024. The notional amount of the Company’s outstanding interest rate swap contract at September 30, 2024 was $300.0 million. The maturity date of this swap is\nJune 30, 2027, and the fair value of the outstanding swap contract was $11.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\nThe following table presents the future principal payment obligations, interest payments, and fair values associated with the Company’s debt instruments assuming the Company’s\nactual level of variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands).\nFor the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, Fair\n2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Value\nDebt obligations\nTerm Loan A $ 26,563 $ 31,875 $ 333,750 $ — $ 392,188 $ 392,188\nRevolving Credit Facility — — 122,850 — 122,850 122,850\nInterest payments (1) 33,406 31,435 22,196 —\n(1) Represents projected interest payments using the Company’s September 2024 SOFR-based floating rate of 6.60%.\nSee also Note 20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Investments in Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n40\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated November 25, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\nthe financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee of the board of directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not,\nby communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – Revenue Recognized Over Time Under Uncompleted Long-Term Construction Contracts\nAs described in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has recognized $2,496,230,000 of costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts at September 30,\n2024. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue derived from long-term construction contracts over time as the Company satisfies the\nsingle performance obligation for each construction contract. Progress towards completion of the performance obligation of each long-term construction project is estimated using\nthe input method, which is measured by the relationship of total costs incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required to complete the project (cost-to-cost\ninput method). Recognition of revenue under uncompleted long-term construction contracts requires significant judgment by management, including measuring progress towards\ncompletion of the contract by estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete the performance obligation of a contract.\nWe have identified the revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts that were uncompleted at September 30, 2024 as a critical audit matter because of the significant\nassumptions management makes in determining the amount of revenue to recognize prior to completion of the performance obligation of a contract. Auditing management’s\njudgments related to measuring progress towards completion of the Company’s long-term construction contracts through estimating total costs expected to be incurred to complete\nthe performance obligation of the long-term contracts involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort. Our audit procedures related to revenue recognized\nunder uncompleted long-term construction contracts included the following, among others:\n42\nTable of Contents\n• We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to revenue recognized under long-term construction contracts and tested such controls for design and\nimplementation, as well as operating effectiveness, including management’s controls over the estimation of total contract costs to be incurred in order to complete the\nperformance obligation of uncompleted contracts.\n• We selected a sample of long-term construction contracts, and we performed the following:\n◦ Compared the current year costs incurred to prior year estimates of costs to complete, which involved comparing projects completed during the fiscal year with the\nestimates made as of the previous balance sheet date to evaluate management’s ability to accurately estimate costs to complete the performance obligation of its\nlong-term construction contracts.\n◦ Analyzed the estimated cost to complete and gross margins for uncompleted contracts by comparing the Company’s three-year historical average gross margins by\ncustomer type to the estimated margin for uncompleted contracts at September 30, 2024.\n◦ Inquired with individuals outside of the accounting function, including project management teams and individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation, to obtain corroborating evidence regarding estimates of costs to complete and estimated gross margins on uncompleted contracts.\n• Compared the costs and estimated earnings during the month immediately subsequent to the fiscal year end to costs and estimated earnings to date on uncompleted contracts\nat September 30, 2024,and, on a sample basis, inquired with individuals responsible for oversight and satisfaction of the performance obligation in the contracts in order to\nobtain corroborating evidence regarding estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 25, 2024\n43\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Construction Partners, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Construction Partners, Inc., and its subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the\nCompany as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 30, 2024, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements, and our report dated November 25, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,\nassessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,\nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial\nstatements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nBirmingham, Alabama\nNovember 25, 2024\n44\nTable of Contents\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in

(the “Company”) is a civil infrastructure company that specializes in the construction and maintenance of roadways across the Sunbelt in Alabama,\nFlorida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of products and services to both\npublic and private infrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. The Company’s primary operations\nconsist of (i) manufacturing and distributing hot mix asphalt (“HMA”) for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with construction projects, (ii) paving activities,\nincluding the construction of roadway base layers and application of asphalt pavement, (iii) site development, including the installation of utility and drainage systems, (iv) mining\naggregates, such as sand, gravel and construction stone, that are used as raw materials in the production of HMA and for sales to third parties, and (v) distributing liquid asphalt\ncement for both internal use and sales to third parties in connection with HMA production.\nThe Company was formed in 2007 by SunTx Capital Partners (“SunTx”), a private equity firm based in Dallas, Texas, as a holding company to facilitate an acquisition growth\nstrategy in the HMA paving and construction industry.\nManagement’s Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity, revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and\nthe disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates are used in accounting for items such as recognition of revenues and cost of\nrevenues, investments, mineral reserves, goodwill and other intangible assets, business acquisitions, valuation of operating lease right-of-use assets, allowance for credit losses,\nvaluation allowances related to income taxes, accruals for potential liabilities related to lawsuits or insurance claims, asset retirement obligations, valuation of derivative\ninstruments and valuation of equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are continually evaluated based on historical information and actual experience; however, actual results\ncould differ from these estimates.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists principally of currency on hand and demand deposits at commercial banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid securities that are both readily convertible\nto known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents include\nsecurities with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains demand accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit at several banks. From time\nto time, account balances have exceeded the maximum available federal deposit insurance coverage limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and\nregularly monitors its credit risk.\nRestricted Cash\nConstruction Partners Risk Management, Inc. (the “Captive”), a captive insurance company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides general liability, automobile\nliability and workers’ compensation insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries. Restricted cash represents cash held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the\npayment of casualty insurance claims. The Company had restricted cash of $2.0 million and $0.8 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of such amounts\nshown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (unaudited, in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 74,686 $ 48,243\nRestricted cash 1,998 837\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 76,684 $ 49,080\nRestricted Investments\nThe Company’s restricted investments consist of debt securities, which are held in a fiduciary capacity by the Captive for the payment of casualty insurance claims. The Company\ndetermines the classification of its securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the determination at each balance sheet date. The Company has classified securities held by the\nCaptive as available-for-sale. As a result, these securities are carried at their fair value. Purchases and sales of debt securities are recorded on the trade date. Interest income on debt\nsecurities is recorded when earned using an effective yield method. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net.\nThese securities have been classified as non-current assets based on their respective maturity dates and the Company’s intent to reinvest sales proceeds into new restricted\ninvestments. The Company had restricted investments of $18.0 million and $15.1 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company evaluates its available-for-sale debt securities quarterly to determine whether there has been a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost due to credit losses or\nother factors. This evaluation process entails judgement by the Company, and considers factors including the issuer’s financial condition and near-term prospects, future economic\nconditions, interest rate changes and changes in the rating of the security. When the Company has determined that it intends to sell, or that it is more likely than not that the\nCompany will be required to sell a security before it recovers its amortized cost basis above fair value, the individual security is written down to fair value, with a corresponding\ncharge to “Other income” within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the intent impairment criteria but for\nwhich the Company has determined that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss allowance is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount\nby which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no intent impairments or credit losses.\nContracts Receivable Including Retainage, Net\nContracts receivable are generally based on amounts billed and currently due from customers, amounts currently due but unbilled, and amounts retained by customers. It is common\nin the Company’s industry for a small portion of either progress billings or the contract price, typically 10%, to be withheld by the customer until contracts are near completion or\nfully completed. Such amounts, defined as retainage, are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Based on the Company’s\nexperience with similar contracts in recent years, billings for such retainage balances are generally collected within one year of the completion of the project.\nContracts receivable including retainage, net is stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for uncollectible accounts\nthrough a charge to earnings and a credit to the allowance for credit losses based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts, type of service performed, current\neconomic conditions, historical losses and other information available to management. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts\nare written off through a charge to the allowance for credit losses and an adjustment to the contract receivable.\nContract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nBilling practices for the Company’s contracts are governed by the contract terms of each project based on (i) progress toward completion approved by the owner, (ii) achievement of\nmilestones or (iii) pre-agreed schedules. Billings do not necessarily correlate with revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost input method. The Company records contract assets\nand contract liabilities to account for these differences in timing.\nThe contract asset, “Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts”, arises when the Company recognizes revenues for services performed under its\nconstruction projects, but the Company is not yet entitled to bill the customer under the terms of the contract. Amounts billed to customers are excluded from this asset and reflected\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Contracts receivable including retainage, net.” Included in costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are amounts the Company\nseeks or will seek to collect from customers or others for (i) errors, (ii) changes in contract specifications or design, (iii) contract change orders in dispute, unapproved as to scope\nand price, or (iv) other customer-related causes of unanticipated\n50\nTable of Contents\nadditional contract costs (such as claims). Such amounts are recorded to the extent that the amount can be reasonably estimated and recovery is probable. Claims and unapproved\nchange orders made by the Company may involve negotiation and, in rare cases, litigation. Unapproved change orders and claims also involve the use of estimates, and revenues\nassociated with unapproved change orders and claims are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. The Company did not recognize any material amounts associated with claims and unapproved change orders during the\nperiods presented.\nThe contract liability, “Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts”, represents the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer\nfor which the Company has been paid by the customer or for which the Company has billed the customer under the terms of the contract. Revenue for future services reflected in\nthis account are recognized, and the liability is reduced, as the Company subsequently satisfies the performance obligation under the contract.\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are typically resolved\nwithin one year and are not considered significant financing components.\nConcentration of Risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contracts receivable including retainage. In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these\nreceivables on an ongoing basis. The Company has not historically experienced significant credit losses, due primarily to management’s assessment of customers’ credit ratings.\nThe Company principally deals with recurring customers, state and local governments and well-known local companies whose reputations are known to management. The\nCompany performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The Company generally has the ability to file\nliens against the property if payments are not made on a timely basis. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s contracts receivable including retainage,\nnet balance at September 30, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nProjects performed for various departments of transportation accounted for 40.7%, 36.2% and 36.8% of consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. Customers that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues during any of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are\npresented below:\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nAlabama Department of Transportation * * 10.0%\nFlorida Department of Transportation 13.6% 10.7% *\nNorth Carolina Department of Transportation * 10.5% 11.2%\n* Less than 10%\nInventories\nThe Company’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are accounted for on an average cost basis or a first-in, first-out cost basis. The cost of\ninventory includes the cost of material, labor, trucking and other equipment costs associated with procuring and transporting materials to HMA plants for production and delivery to\ncustomers. Inventories consist primarily of construction stone that has been removed from aggregates facilities and processed for future sale or internal use, raw materials including\nasphalt cement, and aggregates and millings that the Company expects to utilize on construction projects within one year. Inventories valued on the average cost basis totaled\n$95.8 million and $75.5 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Inventories valued on the first-in, first-out cost basis totaled $10.9 million and $8.5 million,\nrespectively, at September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company derives a significant portion of revenues from contracts with its customers, predominantly by performing construction services for both public and private\ninfrastructure projects, with an emphasis on highways, roads, bridges, airports and commercial and residential developments. These projects are performed for a mix of federal,\nstate, municipal and private customers. In addition, the Company generates revenues from the sale of construction materials, including HMA, aggregates, liquid asphalt and ready-\nmix concrete, to third-party public and private customers pursuant to contracts with those customers. The following table reflects, for the periods presented, (i) revenues generated\nfrom public infrastructure construction projects and the sale of construction materials to public customers and (ii) revenues generated from private infrastructure construction\nprojects and the sale of construction materials to private customers.\n51\nTable of Contents\n% of Consolidated Revenues for the Fiscal\nYear Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nPublic 63.1% 63.0% 60.9%\nPrivate 36.9% 37.0% 39.1%\nRevenues derived from construction projects are recognized over time as the Company satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of the asset created or enhanced\nby the project to the customer. Recognition of revenues for construction projects requires significant judgment by management, including, among other things, estimating total costs\nexpected to be incurred to complete a project and measuring progress toward completion. Management reviews contract estimates regularly to assess revisions of estimated costs to\ncomplete a project and for measurement of progress toward completion. No material adjustments to a contract were noted in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 or\n2022.\nManagement believes the Company maintains reasonable estimates based on prior experience; however, many factors contribute to changes in estimates of contract costs.\nAccordingly, estimates made with respect to uncompleted projects are subject to change as each project progresses and better estimates of contract costs become available. All\ncontract costs are recorded as incurred, and revisions to estimated total costs are reflected as soon as the obligation to perform is determined. Provisions are recognized for the full\namount of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue, regardless of the\nstage of completion. When the Company incurs additional costs related to work performed by subcontractors, the Company may be able to utilize contractual provisions to back\ncharge the subcontractors for those costs. A reduction to costs related to back charges is recognized when estimated recovery is probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Contract costs consist of (i) direct costs on contracts, including labor, materials, and amounts payable to subcontractors and (ii) indirect costs related to contract\nperformance, such as insurance, employee benefits, and equipment (primarily depreciation, fuel, maintenance and repairs).\nProgress toward completion is estimated using the input method, measured by the relationship of total cost incurred through the measurement date to total estimated costs required\nto complete the project (cost-to-cost method). The Company believes this method best depicts the transfer of goods and services to the customer because it represents satisfaction of\nthe Company’s performance obligation under the contract, which occurs as the Company incurs costs. The Company measures percentage of completion based on the performance\nof a single performance obligation under its construction projects. Each of the Company’s construction contracts represents a single performance obligation to complete a defined\nconstruction project. This is because goods and services promised for delivery to a customer are not distinct, as the customer cannot benefit from any individual portion of the\nservices on its own. All deliverables under a contract are part of a project defined by a customer and represent a series of integrated goods and services that have the same pattern of\ndelivery to the customer and use the same measure of progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation as the customer’s asset is created or enhanced by the Company.\nRevenue recognized during a reporting period is based on the cost-to-cost input method applied to the total transaction price, including adjustments for variable consideration, such\nas liquidated damages, penalties or bonuses, related to the timeliness or quality of project performance. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction\nprice at the most likely amount to which the Company expects to be entitled or the most likely amount the Company expects to incur, in the case of liquidated damages or penalties.\nSuch amounts are included in the transaction price for which it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the\nuncertainty is resolved. The Company accounts for changes to the estimated transaction price using a cumulative catch-up adjustment.\nThe majority of the Company’s public construction contracts are fixed unit price contracts. Under fixed unit price contracts, the Company commits to providing materials or services\nrequired by a contract at fixed unit prices (for example, dollars per ton of asphalt placed). The Company’s private customer contracts are primarily fixed total price contracts, also\nknown as lump sum contracts, which require that the total amount of work be performed for a single price. Contract cost is recorded as incurred, and revisions in contract revenue\nand cost estimates are reflected in the accounting period when known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those changes arising from\ncontract change orders, penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to estimated revenues and costs and are recognized in the period in which the\nrevisions are determined.\nChange orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the existing provisions of the contract and become part of the single performance obligation that is\npartially satisfied at the date of the contract modification. This is because goods and services promised under change orders are generally not distinct from the remaining goods and\nservices under the existing contract, due to the significant integration of services performed in the context of the contract. Accordingly, change orders are generally accounted for as\na modification of the existing contract and single performance obligation. The Company accounts for the modification using a cumulative catch-up adjustment. Either the Company\nor its customers may initiate change orders, which may include changes in specifications or designs, manner of performance, facilities, equipment, materials, sites and period of\ncompletion of the work.\n52\nTable of Contents\nRevenues derived from the sale of HMA, aggregates, ready-mix concrete, and liquid asphalt are recognized at a point in time, which is when control of the product is transferred to\nthe customer. Generally, that point in time is when the customer accepts delivery at its facility or receives product in its own transport vehicles from one of the Company’s HMA\nplants or aggregates facilities. Upon purchase, the Company generally provides an invoice or similar document detailing the goods transferred to the customer. The Company\ngenerally offers payment terms customary in the industry, which typically require payment ranging from point-of-sale to 30 days following purchase.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 820,F air Value Measurements\n(“Topic 820”). Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. Inputs used to measure fair value are classified using the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1. Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable\nmarket data.\nLevel 3. Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. The inputs used in the\ndetermination of fair value are based on the best information available under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, contracts receivable including retainage, accounts payable and accrued expenses reflected\nas current assets and current liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, management\nconsiders their carrying value to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has debt securities reflected as restricted investments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. These investments are adjusted to fair\nvalue at each balance sheet date and are considered Level 2 fair value measurements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company also had a Term Loan A and a Revolving Credit Facility, each as defined and described in Note 11 - Debt. The carrying value of amounts\noutstanding under these credit facilities is reflected as long-term debt, net of current maturities and deferred debt issuance costs and current maturities of long-term debt on the\nCompany’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023. Due to the variable rate or short-term nature of these instruments, management considers their carrying\nvalue to approximate their fair value.\nThe Company also has derivative instruments. The fair value of commodity and interest rate swaps are based on forward and spot prices, as described in Note 20 - Fair Value\nMeasurements.\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and leased mineral interests. The fair values of mineral reserves and leased mineral interests are determined using an\nexcess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and forecasts\ndetermined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include sales price, volumes and expected profit margins, net of capital\nrequirements. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant\nassumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would assume if purchasing the acquired business.\nManagement applies fair value measurement guidance to its impairment analysis for tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost or, if acquired in connection with a business combination, at fair value, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements for operating leases are amortized over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.\nMineral reserves and mine development costs, including stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine, are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production\nmethod as aggregates are extracted, using the initial allocation of cost based on proven and probable reserves. Routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset\nimprovements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment categories are as follows:\nCategory Estimated Useful Life\nLand and improvements Land, unlimited; improvements, 15-25 years\nMineral reserves Based on depletion\nBuildings 5 - 39 years\nPlants 3 - 20 years\nConstruction equipment 3 - 10 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 - 10 years\nLeasehold improvements The shorter of 15 years or the remaining lease term\nManagement periodically assesses the estimated useful life over which assets are depreciated, depleted or amortized. If the analysis warrants a change in the estimated useful life of\nproperty, plant and equipment, management will reduce the estimated useful life and depreciate, deplete or amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining\nuseful life.\nThe carrying amounts of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated in the period of disposal, and the resulting gains and losses are included in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the same period.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of such assets, or an asset group, may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that might cause management to perform impairment testing include, but are not\nlimited to, (i) a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, (ii) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, (iii)\nan accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset, (iv) an operating or cash flow performance\ncombined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset, and (v) an expectation that an asset\nwill be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If indicators of potential impairment are present, management performs a recoverability test\nand, if necessary, records an impairment loss. If the total estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset or asset group is\nless than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, measured as the amount required to reduce the\ncarrying value to fair value. Fair value is determined in accordance with the best available information based on the hierarchy described under “Fair Value Measurements” above.\nFor example, the Company would first seek to identify quoted prices or other observable market data. If observable data is not available, management would apply the best\navailable information under the circumstances to a technique, such as a discounted cash flow model, to estimate fair value. Impairment analysis involves estimates and the use of\nassumptions in connection with judgments made in forecasting long-term estimated inflows and outflows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of an asset, and\ndetermining the ultimate useful lives of assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions, which could materially impact the results of an\nimpairment assessment.\nSegment Reporting and Reporting Units\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company operated in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Each of the\nCompany’s platform operating companies engages in essentially the same business, which consists primarily of infrastructure and road construction.\nManagement has determined that the Company functions as a single operating segment, and thus reports as a single reportable segment. This determination is based on rules\nprescribed by GAAP applied to the manner in which management operates the Company. In particular, management assessed the discrete financial information routinely reviewed\nby the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), its Chief Executive Officer, to monitor the Company’s operating performance and support decisions regarding\nallocation of resources to its operations. Specifically, performance is continuously monitored at the consolidated level and as necessary at the individual contract level to timely\nidentify deviations from expected results. Resource allocations are based on the capacity of the Company’s operating facilities to pursue new project opportunities, including\nreallocation of assets that are underutilized from time to time at a certain operating facility to another operating facility where additional resources might be required to fully meet\ndemand. Other factors further supporting this conclusion include substantial similarities throughout all of the Company’s operations with respect to services provided, type of\ncustomers, sourcing of materials and manufacturing and delivery methodologies.\nManagement further determined that, based on their economic similarities, the Company’s operating subsidiaries, representing components, should be aggregated into one reporting\nunit for purposes of assessing potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. These legal entities represent acquisitions\nthat occurred over time pursuant to the Company’s strategic growth strategy. Each operating subsidiary is managed by its president, who has primary responsibility for the\n54\nTable of Contents\nrespective operating subsidiary. These presidents are directly accountable to the CODM and maintain regular contact with the CODM as a team to discuss operating activities,\nfinancial results, forecasts, and operating plans for the Company’s single operating segment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations. Other intangible assets consist of an\nindefinite-lived trade name license in connection with a business acquired, and finite-lived assets, including a non-compete agreement, customer relationships and construction\nbacklog, each acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, management evaluates whether events and circumstances\ncontinue to support an indefinite useful life. Judgments regarding indicators of potential impairment are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.\nAnnually, on the first day of the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter, management performs an analysis of the carrying value of goodwill at its reporting unit for potential impairment.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether conditions exist to indicate that it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes, based on its assessment of relevant events, facts and\ncircumstances, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s carrying value is greater than its fair value, then a quantitative analysis will be performed to determine whether\nthere is any impairment. The Company may also elect to initially perform a quantitative analysis instead of starting with a qualitative assessment. Because the Company has only\none reporting unit, a market capitalization calculation can be performed as the first step of the quantitative assessment by comparing the book value of the Company’s stock\n(determined by reference to the Company’s stockholders’ equity) to the fair value of a share of the Company’s stock. If the fair value of the stock is greater than the book value of\nthe stock, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the fair value is less than the book value, then the Company must take a second step to\ndetermine the impairment amount, as described below.\nThe second step requires comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its fair value, typically using the multiple period discounting method under the\nincome approach and market approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow model, which involves significant estimates and assumptions, including preparation of\nrevenues and profitability growth forecasts, selection of a discount rate, and selection of a terminal year multiple, to estimate fair value. The market approach could include\napplying a control premium to the market price of the Company’s common stock or utilizing guideline public company multiples. Management’s assessment of facts and\ncircumstances at each analysis date could cause these assumptions to change. If the fair value of the respective reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not\nconsidered to be impaired, and no further testing is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to write down\ngoodwill in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill using the market capitalization calculation for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 and determined that the fair value of its\nreporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and thus concluded that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of each goodwill impairment test date, which is July 1 of the\napplicable year. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or performed.\nManagement also annually assesses the carrying value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The\nCompany performed a qualitative impairment assessment of its indefinite-lived trade name licenses. The qualitative assessment did not identify indicators of impairment, and it was\ndetermined that more likely than not the indefinite-lived trade name license fair value was more than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further analysis was required or\nperformed.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nCosts directly associated with obtaining debt financing are capitalized upon the issuance of long-term debt and amortized over the term of the related debt agreement. Unamortized\namounts are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt liability. Loan issuance costs associated\nwith the Revolving Credit Facility are presented as a component of other assets. Loan issuance costs incurred in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility are amortized using\nthe straight-line method over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective tax bases.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which the temporary differences are expected to be\nreversed or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the\n55\nTable of Contents\nperiod that includes the enactment date. Management evaluates the realization of deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or\na portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented on a net basis by taxing authority and classified as non-current\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of the Company’s tax positions that are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical\nmerits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than\nnot to be sustained. The Company classifies income tax-related interest and penalties as interest expense and other expenses, respectively. Refer to Note 15 - Provision for Income\nTaxes for further information regarding the Company’s federal and state income taxes.\nEquity-Based Incentive Plans\nCompensation costs related to equity-classified share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on grant date fair value. Compensation cost for\ngraded-vesting awards is recognized ratably over the respective vesting periods.\nAccrued Insurance Costs\nThe Company carries insurance policies to cover various risks, primarily including general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation, under which it is liable to\nreimburse the insurance company for a portion of each claim paid. Since October 1, 2021, the Captive has retained liability for the first $1,000,000 of each claim paid. Also since\nOctober 1, 2021, the Company has been a member of CIRCA, Limited, a group captive insurance company, that retains the next $550,000 per claim liability for each claim paid.\nThe Company utilizes various primary and excess insurance companies to cover the liability for claims in excess of the retained amounts. Changes in loss assumptions caused by\nchanges in actual experience would affect the assessment of the ultimate liability and could have an effect on the Company’s operating results and financial position. Management\naccrues insurance costs for probable losses, both reported and unreported, that are reasonably estimable using actuarial methods based on historical trends modified, if necessary, by\nrecent events.\nThe Company provides employee medical insurance under policies that are both fixed-premium, fully-insured policies and self-insured policies that are administered by the\ninsurance company. Under the self-insured policies, the Company is liable to reimburse the insurance company for actual claims paid plus an administrative fee. The Company\npurchases separate stop-loss insurance that limits the individual participant claim loss to amounts ranging from $100,000 to $200,000.\nIn addition to the retention items noted above, the Company’s insurance provider requires the Company to maintain a standby letter of credit. This letter of credit serves as a\nguarantee to pay the Company’s insurance provider the incurred claim costs attributable to general liability, workers’ compensation and automobile liability claims, up to the\namount stated in the standby letter of credit, in the event that these claims are not paid by the Company (see Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies).\nWarranties\nFor some contracts, the Company is required to furnish a warranty that is usually one year in length. Because of the nature of these contracts, including contract owner inspections\nof the work both during construction and prior to acceptance, the Company has not experienced significant warranty costs for these short-term warranties and, therefore, has not\nestablished an accrual of these costs. Certain contracts carry longer warranty periods, for which the Company has accrued an estimate of warranty costs. The warranty liability is\nestimated based on the Company’s experience with the specific type of construction work and was not significant as of September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net income per share attributable to\ncommon stockholders, but includes dilutive unvested stock awards using the treasury stock method.\nStripping Costs\nStripping costs are costs incurred for the removal of overburden or waste materials for the purpose of obtaining access to aggregate materials that will be commercially produced.\n56\nTable of Contents\nStripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are capitalized and reported within property, plant and equipment, net in the Company’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are depleted in accordance with the units-of-production method as aggregates are extracted, once the mine\nis no longer in the development stage. Pre-production stripping costs included in property, plant and equipment were $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as of September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nStripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs and are included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the\nstripping costs are incurred. The production phase of a mine is deemed to begin when saleable minerals are extracted, regardless of the level of production. However, the production\nphase does not commence with the removal of de minimis saleable mineral material that occurs in conjunction with the removal of overburden or waste material for the purpose of\nobtaining access to aggregate materials. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced for the fiscal years ended September 30,\n2024, 2023 and 2022 were $3.2 million, $3.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations (“AROs”) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets resulting from the acquisition, construction, development\nand/or normal use of the underlying assets. The ARO is recognized at its estimated fair value in the period in which it is incurred. These obligations generally include the estimated\nnet future costs of dismantling, restoring and reclaiming operating mines and related mine sites, in accordance with federal, state, local regulatory and land lease agreement\nrequirements. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated\nuseful life of the related asset. The liability is accreted over time through charges to earnings. Reclamation costs are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the estimated present\nvalue resulting from the passage of time and revisions to the estimates of either the timing or amount of the reclamation and abandonment costs. If the ARO is settled for an amount\nother than the carrying amount of the liability, the Company recognizes a gain or loss on settlement. The Company reviews, on an annual basis, unless otherwise deemed necessary,\nthe asset retirement obligation at each mine site in accordance with ASC guidance for accounting for reclamation obligations.\nTo determine the fair value of the AROs, the Company estimates the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation activities including a reasonable profit margin.\nThis cost is then increased for future estimated inflation based on the estimated years to complete and discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted,\nrisk-free rate. See Note 23 - Asset Retirement Obligations.\nRight of Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nAt the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether a contract contains a lease by assessing whether the contract conveys to the Company the right to\ncontrol the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. Leases are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (“Topic 842”).\nThe Company measures and records an operating lease liability equal to the present value of the future lease payments. Because most of the Company’s leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of lease payments. The amount of the operating lease right-of-use asset consists of:\n(i) the amount of the initial measurement of the operating lease liability; (ii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, and\n(iii) any initial direct costs incurred. The present value calculation may account for an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will\nexercise the option. Within the provisions of certain leases, there are escalations in payments over the base lease term, which have been reflected in lease expense on a straight-line\nbasis for operating leases over the expected lease term. A portion of the Company’s lease contracts contain the option to extend or renew. The Company assesses these options for\nindividual leases in determining the initial measurement of the operating lease liability.\nThe Company has elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases (those with terms of 12 months or less) or leases to explore for or use\nminerals. Instead, for these types of leases, the Company recognizes lease expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nComprehensive Income\nThe Company reports comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity. Comprehensive\nincome consists of two subsets: net income and other comprehensive income (“OCI”). OCI includes adjustments for changes in fair value of an interest rate swap contract derivative\nand available-for-sale restricted investments. For additional information about comprehensive income, see Note 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n57\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805,B usiness Combinations (“Topic 805”), which\nallocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, other than leases\nacquired in connection with business combinations, which are recorded based on Topic 842, and contract assets and liabilities acquired in connection with business combinations,\nwhich are recorded based on ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nDetermining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company engages\nthird-party appraisal firms when appropriate to assist in the fair value determination of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs\nassociated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Any such adjustments are the\nresult of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments\nare generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation,\namortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.\nNote 3 - Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company monitors all Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and other authoritative guidance. There are no\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Pending Adoption\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which requires enhanced disclosures related to\nsignificant segment expenses and a description of how the chief operating decision maker utilizes segment operating profit or loss to assess segment performance. The new standard\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and is to be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on the\nCompany’s financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of specific categories and\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation table and expands disclosures related to income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024 and is to be applied prospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nNote 4 - Business Acquisitions\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries made the following business acquisitions:\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Hubbard Paving & Grading, Inc., an asphalt and paving company headquartered in Walhalla, South\nCarolina, for $3.0 million. This transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Upstate region of South Carolina.\nOn November 1, 2023, the Company acquired three HMA plants and certain related assets from Reeves Construction Company for $18.3 million. This transaction added HMA\nplants in Concord, North Carolina and Rock Hill and McConnells, South Carolina.\nOn December 29, 2023, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of SJ&L General Contractor, LLC (“SJ&L”), an HMA and sitework\ncompany headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, for $57.1 million. This transaction expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Huntsville, Alabama metro area. In\nconnection with this acquisition, the Company issued awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (defined below) to a certain key former employee of SJ&L who became a\nconsultant to the Company consisting of 22,791 shares of restricted Class A common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.0 million. The Company also entered into\na five-year non-compete agreement with a key former employee of SJ&L who became an employee of the Company providing for cash payments totaling $1.9 million, payable in\nten equal payments on each six-month anniversary of the closing of the acquisition.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOn January 2, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Littlefield Construction Company, a soil base, surface treatment and sitework company headquartered\nin Waycross, Georgia, for $6.5 million. This transaction expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Waycross, Georgia area.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company acquired certain assets of Sunbelt Asphalt Surfaces, Inc. (“Sunbelt Asphalt”), an asphalt paving company headquartered in Auburn, Georgia, for\n$29.2 million. The transaction added an HMA plant and a greenfield plant site in northeastern Georgia. In connection with this acquisition, the Company issued awards under the\n2018 Equity Incentive Plan (defined below) to certain key former employees of Sunbelt Asphalt who became employees of the Company consisting of (i) 30,000 shares of\nrestricted Class A common stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.5 million and (ii) performance stock awards representing a target of 30,000 shares of Class A\ncommon stock having an aggregate grant date fair value of $1.5 million.\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Hudson Paving, Inc., an asphalt and paving company headquartered in Rockingham, North Carolina, for\n$19.1 million. This transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the Sandhills region of North Carolina.\nOn August 1, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Robinson Paving Company, headquartered in Columbus, Georgia, for $59.5 million. This transaction\nadded three HMA plants and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in Columbus, Georgia and surrounding areas.\nOn September 10, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of John G. Walton Construction Company, Inc., headquartered in Mobile, Alabama, for $38.9 million.\nThis transaction added an HMA plant and expanded the Company’s service capabilities in the greater Mobile and southwestern Alabama market area.\nCombined Acquisitions During the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2024\nThe above-referenced acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations in accordance with Topic 805. The Company consulted with independent third parties to assist in\nthe valuation process. Total consideration transferred for these eight acquisitions was $231.7 million as of September 30, 2024.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values based on the methodologies described under Business Acquisitions in Note 2 -\nSignificant Accounting Policies. The amount of the purchase price exceeding the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill in the\naggregate amount of $71.0 million for these eight acquisitions, which is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill primarily represents the assembled workforce and synergies\nexpected to result from the acquisitions.\nThe results of operations attributable to these acquisitions are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal year ended September\n30, 2024, from their respective acquisition dates forward. The Company records certain costs to effect acquisitions as they are incurred, which are reflected in general and\nadministrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the amounts of $1.5 million, $0.3 million, and $0.8 million for the fiscal years\nended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThere are certain acquisitions with provisional estimates that are subject to finalization due to the recent timing of the acquisitions, status of valuations and finalization of working-\ncapital agreements. These estimates are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the values presented below.

Shares of the Company’s Class A common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market\ntransactions at prevailing market prices, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws, including Rule 10b5-1 plans. The stock\nrepurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares of Class A common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended, extended or\nterminated at any time by the Company’s Board of Directors. The actual timing, number and value of shares of Class A common stock repurchased will be determined by a\ncommittee of the Board of Directors at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock, capital allocation\nalternatives, general market and economic conditions and other corporate considerations.

The final number of shares of common\nstock issuable upon vesting of PSUs can range from 0% to 150% of the number of PSUs initially granted, depending on the level of achievement, as determined by the\nCompensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The achievement of performance goals is modified by the total stockholder return ranking of the Company against\nthe Russell 2000 Index over the performance period and can increase or decrease the achieved award by up to 15%. The Company recognizes expense, net of estimated forfeitures,\nfor PSUs based on the forecasted achievement of Company performance metrics, multiplied by the fair value of the total number of shares of common stock that the Company\nanticipates will be issued based on such achievement.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company awarded PSUs representing a target of 113,044 shares and forecasted vesting of 84,783 shares of Class A common\nstock to certain members of Company management under the Equity Incentive Plan. The grants are classified as equity awards. The aggregate grant date fair value of these PSU\nawards was $5.5 million. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded compensation expense in connection with PSUs in the amount of\n$2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which is reflected as general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company forecasted 149,807 shares of Class A common stock underlying PSUs as unvested and approximately $3.9 million of unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to PSU awards, which will be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

At September 30, 2024, there was approximately $3.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense\nrelated to these awards, which will be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of 3 years.\nThe grant date fair value of cash-settled RSU awards is based on the price of the Company’s Class A common stock and the number of RSUs awarded on the date of grant. The\nawards must be settled in cash and are accounted for as liability-type awards. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period with remeasurement at the end of each\nreporting period at fair value until settlement. The requisite service period is based on the vesting provisions of the awards, which generally occurs in four equal annual installments\nbeginning on the date of the first fiscal year-end after the grant date.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Construction Partners, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) became effective on May 13, 2021.

Management evaluated the Company’s tax positions based on\nappropriate provisions of applicable enacted tax laws and regulations and believes that they are supportable based on their specific technical merits and the facts and circumstances\nof the transactions.\nThe provision for income taxes (benefit) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nCurrent\nU.S. Federal $ (2,124) $ 3,520 $ —\nState 2,604 1,718 949\nTotal current 480 5,238 949\nDeferred\nU.S. Federal 19,043 9,959 5,662\nState 3,638 1,206 304\nTotal deferred 22,681 11,165 5,966\nProvision for income taxes $ 23,161 $ 16,403 $ 6,915\nDifferences exist between income and expenses reported on the consolidated financial statements and those deducted for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting.T he\nCompany’s deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following temporary difference tax effects at September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n72\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nDeferred tax assets\nAmortization of finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,082 $ 1,022\nFederal net operating loss carryforward 4,099 —\nFederal interest limitation carryforward 6,198 1,254\nState net operating loss carryforward 3,160 1,177\nEmployee benefits 7,959 4,695\nOther 3,846 2,709\nTotal deferred tax assets 26,344 10,857\nDeferred tax liabilities\nAmortization of goodwill (11,860) (8,647)\nProperty, plant and equipment (66,216) (32,939)\nInterest rate swap contract (2,115) (6,343)\nOther (5) (49)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (80,196) (47,978)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (53,852) $ (37,121)\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 include gross deferred tax assets of $26.3 million and $10.9 million, respectively. In assessing the realization of\ndeferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax\nassets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of\ndeferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryforward periods), projected taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the\nweight of all evidence known and available as of the balance sheet date, management believes that these tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized in the future. To the\nextent that management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established.\nIncome taxes payable have been reduced by fuel tax credits of $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining\namount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes was $164.9 million and $109.5 million at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) to amounts reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in\nthousands):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nAsset: Deferred income taxes, net $ — $ —\nLiability: Deferred income taxes, net (53,852) (37,121)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (53,852) $ (37,121)\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19.5 million and $0.0 million, respectively, and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $65.4 million and $27.8 million, respectively. The state net operating loss credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts between the fiscal years ended\nSeptember 30, 2032 and 2043 or are indefinite.\nThe U.S. statutory federal income tax rate applicable to the Company was 21% during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022T. he following table reconciles\nincome taxes based on the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n(in thousands):\n73\nTable of Contents\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nProvision for income tax at federal statutory rate $ 19,340 $ 13,735 $ 5,941\nState income taxes 2,817 2,222 569\nPermanent differences 983 348 353\nOther 21 98 52\nProvision for income taxes $ 23,161 $ 16,403 $ 6,915\nUncertain Tax Positions\nASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“Topic 740”), prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement model for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position\ntaken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions in the United States. Tax audits, by their nature, are often complex. In the normal course of business, the Company is\nsubject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of\ntaxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of the calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, management determines\nwhether the benefits of the Company’s tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions\nthat are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, management accrues the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained. Such accruals require\nmanagement to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. The Company\nperformed an analysis of its tax positions and determined that no uncertain tax positions existed at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Accordingly, there was no liability for uncertain tax\npositions at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Based on the provisions of Topic 740, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 or 2023. Due to the\nutilization of net operating loss carryforwards, the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 through 2023 are subject to examination.\nVarious state income tax returns for fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 through 2023 are also subject to examination.\nNote 16 - Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all employees who are at least1 8 years old and have more than six months of service.

At September 30, 2024,\n$0.1 million and $0.1 million was reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining\nbalances on this note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company also received a note from the disposed entity (“Disposed Entity”) on December 31, 2017 in the\namount of $1.0 million representing certain accounts payable of the disposed entity that were paid by the Company. At September 30, 2024, $0.1 million and $0.1 million was\nreflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets, respectively, representing the remaining balances on this note receivable.\nRemaining principal and interest payments are scheduled to be made in periodic installments through fiscal year 2026.\nPrior to its acquisition by the Company, a current subsidiary of the Company advanced funds to an entity owned by an immediate family member of an officer of the Company in\nconnection with a land development project. The obligations of the borrower entity to repay the advances were guaranteed by a separate entity owned by the same family member of\nthe officer. Amounts outstanding under the advances did not bear interest and matured in full in March 2021. In March 2021, the subsidiary of the Company amended and restated\nthe terms of the repayment obligation, as a result of which the officer personally assumed the remaining balance of the obligation. No new amounts were advanced to the officer by\nthe Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof in connection with the transaction. Under the amended and restated terms, the officer executed a promissory note in favor of the\nCompany’s subsidiary in the principal amount of $0.8 million. The note bears simple interest at a rate of4 .0% and requires annual minimum payments of $0.1 million inclusive of\nprincipal and accrued interest, with any remaining principal and accrued interest due and payable in full on December 31, 2027. Amounts outstanding under the note are reflected\non the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets within other current assets and other assets (“Land Development Project”).\n74\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, the Company conducts or has conducted business with the following related parties:\n• Entities owned by immediate family members of an executive officer of the Company perform subcontract work for a subsidiary of the Company, including trucking and\ngrading services (“Subcontracting Services”).\n• Since June 1, 2014, the Company has been a party to an access agreement with Island Pond Corporate Services, LLC, which provides a location for the Company to conduct\nbusiness development activities from time to time on a property owned by the Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors (“Island Pond”).\n• The Company is party to a management services agreement with SunTx, under which the Company pays SunTx $0.30 million per fiscal quarter and reimburses certain\ntravel and other out-of-pocket expenses associated with services rendered under the management services agreement.\nThe following table presents revenues earned and expenses incurred by the Company during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and receivable and\naccounts payable balances at September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to transactions with the related parties described above (in thousands):\nRevenue Earned (Expense Incurred) Receivable (Payable)\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2022 2024 2023\nPurchaser of Subsidiary $ — $ — $ — $ 207 $ 311\nDisposed Entity — — — 132 198\nLand Development Project — — — 548 632\nSubcontracting Services (7,142)(1) (8,627)(1) (8,655)(1) (239) (593)\nIsland Pond (400)(2) (340)(2) (320)(2) — —\nSunTx (2,002)(2) (1,486)(2) (1,451)(2) — —\n(1) Cost is reflected as cost of revenues on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n(2) Cost is reflected as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nNote 18 - Commitments and Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to inquiries or audits by taxing authorities arising from its operations, covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course\nof business, such as income taxes and other types of taxes.

These investments are included within\n“Restricted Investments” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 21 - Investment in Derivative Instruments\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts\nThe Company uses derivative instruments as part of its overall strategy to manage its exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company regularly\nmonitors the financial stability and credit standing of the counterparties to its derivative instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for\nspeculative purposes.\nThe Company records derivatives at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as one of the following: (i) a hedge of a\nforecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid (“cash flow hedge”) or (ii) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value hedge”).\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until they are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects\nearnings.\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified and designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the\nhedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.\nIf the Company does not specifically designate a derivative as one of the above, changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivative instrument are reported in current period\nearnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged in the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows, while cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included as an investing activity.\nIf the Company determines that it qualifies for and will designate a derivative as a hedging instrument, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging\nactivities, including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes matching all derivatives that are designated as\ncash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions and linking all derivatives designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company performs an initial prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness on a quantitative basis between the inception date and the earlier of the first quarterly hedge\neffectiveness date or the issuance of the financial statements that include the hedged transaction. On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of designated hedges\nin offsetting the variability in the cash flows or fair values of the hedged assets or obligations using a qualitative assessment. The Company would discontinue hedge accounting\nprospectively when the derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable or the hedging instrument expires, is sold,\nterminated or exercised.\nCommodity Swap Contracts\nThe Company’s operations expose it to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. As part of its risk management process, the Company began\nentering into commodity swap transactions through regulated commodity exchanges. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nChanges in fair value of commodity swaps are recognized in earnings.\nThe following table represents the approximate amount of realized and unrealized gains (losses) and changes in fair value recognized in earnings on commodity derivative contracts\nfor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the fair value of these derivatives as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n78\nTable of Contents\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nChange in Change in Change in\nRealized Unrealized Total Gain Realized Unrealized Gain Total Gain Realized Unrealized Total Gain\nGain (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss) (Loss) Gain (Loss) Gain (Loss) (Loss)\nCost of revenues $ (61) $ (184) $ (245) $ (2,255) $ (342) $ (2,597) $ 3,472 $ (1,286) $ 2,186\nInterest expense, net 10,630 — 10,630 8,297 — 8,297 (806) 1,668 862\nTotal $ 10,569 $ (184) $ 10,385 $ 6,042 $ (342) $ 5,700 $ 2,666 $ 382 $ 3,048\nSeptember 30,\nBalance Sheet Classification 2024 2023\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets - commodity swaps(2) $ — $ 204\nOther assets - interest rate swap (1) 11,646 26,909\nAccrued expense and other current liabilities - commodity swaps(2) — (20)\nNet unrealized gain position $ 11,646 $ 27,093\n(1) Represents designated cash flow hedge of $11.6 million and $26.9 million as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) Represents derivatives not designated as hedges.\nNote 22 - Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of two subsets: net income and OCI.

In addition, the Company agreed to (i) pay cash to the selling unit holders in an amount equal to the working capital remaining in Lone\nStar Paving at closing, as finally determined (subject to adjustments and offsets to satisfy certain indemnification obligations and any purchase price overpayments), to be paid out\nin quarterly installments over four quarters following the closing and (ii) purchase from the selling unit holders for $30.0 million in cash an entity that owns certain real property\nfollowing receipt of specified operational entitlements by such entity. The cash paid at closing was funded from the proceeds of the Term Loan B (defined below).

The Term Loan B Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured first lien term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of\n$850.0 million, which amount was fully drawn on November 1, 2024 (the “Term Loan B”). A portion of the proceeds of the Term Loan B was used to finance the cash portion of\nthe consideration for the Lone Star Paving acquisition, including the repayment of certain outstanding indebtedness of Lone Star Paving and its subsidiaries at the closing. The\nremaining loan proceeds were or will be used (i) to repay the Company’s outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility provided by the Term Loan A / Revolver\nCredit Agreement, (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing debt financing transactions and the Lone Star Acquisition and (iii) for working capital and\nother corporate purposes as permitted by the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.\nThe term loan matures on November 1, 2031 (the “Term Loan B Maturity Date”), and all outstanding principal amounts and accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and\npayable on such date. The Company must repay the term loan in equal quarterly installments, commencing with the first full fiscal quarter ending after the date of the Term Loan B\nCredit Agreement, in an aggregate principal amount equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the term loan, subject to adjustment for, among other things, any incremental term\nloans, with the balance payable on the Term Loan B Maturity Date.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a rate per annum equal to (i) a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate for the applicable interest period (“Term SOFR”) plus an applicable margin (the “Term SOFR Loans”) or (ii) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus the\napplicable margin (the “Base Rate Loans”). The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (w) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (x) the rate\nof interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate”, (y) Term SOFR plus 1.00% and (z) 1.00%. The applicable margin\nis (A) 2.50% in the case of Term SOFR Loans and (B) 1.50% in the case of Base Rate Loans. With respect to any Term SOFR Loans, the Company is required to pay interest on the\nlast day of each one-, three- or six-month interest period, as elected by the Company, and, if such interest period is longer than three months, also at the end of each three-month\nperiod during such interest period. With respect to any Base Rate Loans, the Company is required to pay interest quarterly in arrears.\nAmendment to Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Fourth Amendment to the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement to, among other things, permit (i) the Lone Star\nAcquisition, (ii) entry into the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, and (iii) certain liens to be granted to secure the indebtedness incurred under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement on\na pari passu basis with the liens securing the Company’s obligations under the Term Loan A / Revolver Credit Agreement.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) had one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended: our Class A common stock, $0.001 par value (“Class A common stock”).\nDescription of Capital Stock\nThe following is a description of the material terms of our capital stock. It does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by our\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), our Amended and Restated Bylaws (as amended and restated from time to time, the\n“Bylaws”), and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”). Copies of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws have been filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission as Exhibits 3.1 and 3.2 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nUnder our Certificate of Incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of:\n• 400,000,000 shares of Class A common stock;\n• 100,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.001 par value (“Class B common stock”); and\n• 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 43,819,102 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, 8,861,698 shares of Class B common stock outstanding and no shares of\nundesignated preferred stock issued or outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, we had reserved 1,241,710 additional shares of Class A common stock and 2,000,000 shares of\nClass B common stock for issuance under our various stock and compensation incentive plans. Unless our board of directors determines otherwise, we will issue all shares of\nour capital stock in uncertificated form.\nClass A Common Stock\nDividend Rights\nThe holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate if, as and when declared by our board of directors, out of our legally available\nassets, in cash, property, shares of our common stock or other securities, after the payment of dividends required to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. The holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. The holders of Class\nA common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, unless\notherwise required by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws. The holders of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election\nof directors.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up or upon a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, the assets legally available for distribution to our\nstockholders will be distributable ratably among the holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock treated as a single class, subject to the prior satisfaction of all\noutstanding debts and other liabilities and the preferential rights and liquidation preferences to be paid on our outstanding preferred stock, if any.\nModification of Rights\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will not amend, alter, repeal or waive certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, or adopt any provision\ninconsistent therewith or effect any reclassification of the shares of Class A common stock, unless such action is first approved by the affirmative vote or written consent of the\nholders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the holders of Class A\ncommon stock will have no right to vote thereon. However, this provision is subject to any other vote required by applicable law, and under Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL,\nholders of Class A common stock would be entitled to vote as a class upon a proposed action, whether or not entitled to vote by the Certificate of Incorporation, if such action\nwould increase or decrease the par value of Class A common stock, or alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights thereof so as to affect them adversely.\nOther Matters\nThe holders of Class A common stock have no sinking fund or redemption provisions, or conversion or preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of Class A common\nstock are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Class A common stock is not convertible into any other shares of our capital stock.\nExchange Listing\nThe Class A common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “ROAD.”\nPreferred Stock\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock. Unless required by law or by any rules adopted by\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, these authorized shares of preferred stock will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors is\nable to determine, with respect to any series of preferred stock, the terms and rights of such series, including dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, terms of\nredemption, liquidation rights and any other relative rights, powers and preferences, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of such series.\nWe could issue a series of preferred stock that, depending on its terms, may impede or discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority,\nof our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which they might receive a premium over the market price for their shares of Class A common stock.\nAdditionally, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of Class A common stock by restricting dividends on Class A common stock, diluting the voting\npower of Class A common stock or subordinating the liquidation rights of Class A common stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could\nhave an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain Provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company contain certain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nDual Class Structure\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides for a dual class structure, under which each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share and each share of our\nClass B common stock has ten votes per share.\nAuthorized but Unissued Capital Stock\nThe Certificate of Incorporation authorizes shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and preferred stock that are unissued and unreserved.\nClassified Board\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws classify the Board of Directors into three classes of directors as nearly equal in number as possible, each of which will\nserve for three years, with one class of directors being elected each year.\nRemoval of Directors; Vacancies\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that directors may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of all then-\noutstanding shares of stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; provided, however, that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding,\ndirectors may only be removed for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock entitled\nto vote thereon, voting together as a single class. In addition, the Certificate of Incorporation provides that, subject to the rights granted to one or more series of preferred stock\nthen outstanding, if any, any vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum,\nby a sole remaining director or by the stockholders; provided, however, that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, any newly created directorship on\nour board of directors that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy occurring on our board of directors may only be filled by a majority of the\ndirectors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director and not by stockholders.\nSpecial Meetings\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the board of directors, Chief\nExecutive Officer, the board of directors or at the request of the holders of 25% of the Class B common stock. The Bylaws prohibit the conduct of any business at a special\nmeeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.\nAdvance Notice Requirement\nThe Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than\nnominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof. In order for any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will\nhave to comply with advance notice requirements and provide us with certain information. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice must be received at our principal\nexecutive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders. The Bylaws also\nspecify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice. The Bylaws allow the chairman of the meeting at a meeting of the stockholders to adopt rules and\nregulations for the conduct of meetings that may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if such rules and regulations are not followed.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Certificate of Incorporation contains provides that we may not engage in certain “business combinations” with any “interested stockholder” for a three-year period\nfollowing the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n• prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested\nstockholder;\n• upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in such stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, such stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting\nstock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n• at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our\noutstanding voting stock that is not owned by such stockholder.\nNo Cumulative Voting\nThe Certificate of Incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting.\nLimitation of Liability of Directors and Officers\nThe Certificate of Incorporation generally provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, no director or officer shall be liable to the Company or its\nstockholders for monetary damages for breach of certain fiduciary duties as a director or officer. Under the DGCL, a director’s liability may not be eliminated:\n• for any breach(es) of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or to our stockholders;\n• for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n• for certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions or repurchases; and\n• for any transaction from which the director or officer derives an improper personal benefit.\nThe effect of this provision is to restrict the rights of the Company and its stockholders to recover monetary damages against a director or officer for breach of certain\nfiduciary duties as a director.\nSupermajority Voting\nThe Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, amend, change, add to, rescind or repeal, in\nwhole or in part, the Bylaws without a stockholder vote in any matter. For as long as shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, any alteration, amendment,\nchange, addition, rescission or repeal of the Bylaws by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of our stock present\nin person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such alteration, amendment, change, addition, rescission or repeal. Once no shares of our Class B common stock\nremain outstanding, any alteration, amendment, change, addition, rescission or repeal of the Bylaws by our stockholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\n66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThe Certificate of Incorporation provides that once no shares of our Class B common stock remain outstanding, certain provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation\nmay be altered, amended, changed, added to, rescinded or repealed only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in voting power of all the then-outstanding\nshares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nExclusive Forum Clause\nThe Bylaws contain a forum selection clause that provides that unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district\ncourts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nExhibit 19.1\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nPOLICY PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING\nAND UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO OTHERS\nThis policy supersedes all previous insider trading policies adopted by our board of directors.\nIntroduction\nFederal and state securities laws generally prohibit any person who is aware of material nonpublic information about a company from trading in securities of that company.\nThese laws also prohibit such person from disclosing material nonpublic information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information.\nOur board of directors has adopted this policy to promote compliance with these laws and to protect you and our company from the serious liabilities and penalties that can\nresult from violations of these laws.\nIt is your responsibility to comply with the securities laws and this policy.

You are responsible for\nmaking sure that these other persons and entities comply with this policy.\nIn addition to this policy, our directors, executive officers and certain other designated persons who have access to material nonpublic information about us are subject to a\nsupplemental policy that imposes additional restrictions on their trading in Company securities.\nIf you possess material nonpublic information regarding us at the time of your employment or other services with us terminates, you remain subject to this policy until the\ninformation has been publicly announced by us or is no longer material.\nCore trading and disclosure restrictions\nThe following trading and disclosure restrictions apply to all of our employees, officers and directors:\n• If you have material nonpublic information regarding us, you must not trade or advise anyone else to trade in our securities until such information has been publicly\ndisclosed.\n• If you have material nonpublic information regarding any other company that you obtained from your employment or relationship with us, you must not trade or advise\nanyone else to trade in the securities of that other company until such information has been publicly disclosed.\n• You must not share material nonpublic information with people in our company whose jobs do not require them to have the information.\n• You must not disclose any nonpublic information, material or otherwise, concerning the Company to anyone outside the Company unless required as part of your duties\nand the person receiving the information has a reason to know the information for Company business purposes.\nTransactions covered by this policy\nThis policy applies to any purchase or sale of Company securities, including our common stock, options to purchase our common stock, any other type of securities that we may\nissue, such as preferred stock, convertible debentures and warrants, as well as exchange-traded options, other derivative securities, and puts, calls and short sales involving\nCompany securities.\nNotwithstanding this general rule, certain transactions under Company benefit plans are not prohibited by this policy. These transactions are discussed in this policy under the\nheading “Exceptions to this policy for certain transactions under Company benefit plans.” In addition, trading in Company securities is not prohibited by this policy if the trades\nare conducted pursuant to a prearranged trading plan that meets certain conditions. These types of plans are discussed in this policy under the heading “Exceptions to this policy\nfor trades pursuant to prearranged trading plans.”\nDefinition of material nonpublic information\nMaterial information. Information about our company is “material” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder or investor would consider it important in\nmaking a decision to buy, sell or hold our securities, or if the disclosure of the information would be expected to significantly alter the total mix of the information in the\nmarketplace about us. In simple terms, material information is any type of information that could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of our securities. Both\npositive and negative information may be material. Information that could be material about our company includes:\n• earnings estimates (including changes of previously announced estimates)\n• a significant change in our operations, projections or strategic plans\n• a potential merger or acquisition\n• a potential sale of significant assets or subsidiaries\n• the gain or loss of a major supplier or customer\n• a new product or discovery\n• a significant pricing change in our products or services\n• a declaration of a stock split, a public or private securities offering by us or a change in our dividend policies or amounts\n• a change in senior management\n• an actual or threatened major lawsuit\nNonpublic information. Nonpublic information is information that is not generally available to the investing public. If you are aware of material nonpublic information, you\nmay not trade until the information has been widely disclosed to the public (for example, through a press release or a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”)) and the market has had sufficient time to absorb the information. For purposes of this policy, information will generally be considered public after the second full\ntrading day following the Company’s public release of the information. For example, if we issued a press release on a Tuesday, the first day that trading could occur would be\non Friday.\nIf you are not sure whether information is material or nonpublic, consult with the Compliance Officer for guidance before engaging in any transaction in Company securities.\nUnauthorized disclosure of information\nYou are prohibited from disclosing to anyone inside or outside the Company any nonpublic information obtained at or through the Company, except when such disclosure is\npart of your regular duties and is needed to enable the Company to carry out its business properly and effectively.\nWe are subject to laws that govern the timing of our disclosures of material information to the public and others. Our Disclosure Policy provides that only certain designated\nemployees may discuss the Company with the news media, securities analysts and investors. All inquiries from outsiders regarding material nonpublic information about the\nCompany should be forwarded to our Chairman of the Board. Accordingly, when an inquiry is made by an outsider, the following response will generally be appropriate:\n“As to these types of matters, the Company’s spokesperson is Ned Fleming, our Chairman of the Board. If there is any comment, he would be the one to contact.”\nThe following procedures are appropriate in protecting the confidentiality of Company information: (i) avoid discussions of confidential matters in places where they might be\noverheard or otherwise disseminated; (ii) mark sensitive documents “confidential” and use sealed envelopes marked “confidential”; (iii) secure confidential documents and\nrestrict the copying of sensitive documents; (iv) provide instructions to receptionists regarding outside inquiries; (v) use code names for sensitive projects; (vi) use passwords to\nrestrict computer access; and (vii) do not use any Internet “chat rooms,” message boards, social networking websites or similar medium available to the public to post any\nunauthorized messages regarding the Company or our business, financial condition, employees, clients or other matters related to us.\nConsequences of violating insider trading laws or this policy\nThe consequences of violating the securities laws or this policy can be severe. They include the following:\nCivil and criminal penalties. If you violate the insider trading or tipping laws, you may be required to\n• pay civil penalties up to three times the profit made or loss avoided\n• pay a criminal penalty of up to $5 million\n• serve a jail term of up to 20 years\nIn addition, the Company and/or the supervisors of a person who violates these laws may also be subject to civil or criminal penalties if they did not take appropriate steps to\nprevent illegal trading.\nCompany discipline. If you violate this policy or insider trading or tipping laws, you may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including termination for\ncause. A violation of our Company policy is not necessarily the same as a violation of law and we may determine that specific conduct violates our policy, whether or not the\nconduct also violates the law. We are not required to await the filing or conclusion of a civil or criminal action against an alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\nReporting of violations. Any employee, officer or director who violates this policy or any federal or state laws governing insider trading or tipping, or knows of any such\nviolation by any other employee, officer or director, must report the violation immediately to the Compliance Officer.\nExceptions to this policy for certain transactions under Company benefit plans\nCertain transactions in Company securities under Company benefit plans are not prohibited by this policy. These are:\nStock option or other equity awards exercises. This policy does not apply to your exercise of an employee stock option or other equity awards. It also does not apply to your\nelection to have the Company withhold shares\nsubject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. This policy does apply, however, to sales of shares received upon exercise of an option, including any broker-\nassisted cashless exercise of an option.\nException to this policy for trades pursuant to prearranged trading plans\nThe trading restrictions in this policy do not apply to trading in Company securities if the trades occur pursuant to a prearranged trading plan that has been precleared\nby our Compliance Officer. An SEC rule, Rule 10b5-1(c), provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability for trades that occur pursuant to a prearranged “trading\nplan” that meets certain specified conditions. You must enter into the trading plan at a time when you were not aware of any material nonpublic information. In addition, the\nestablishment and operation of the trading plan, as well as any modification or termination of the plan prior to its scheduled expiration date, must (a) comply with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) and any Company policies or guidelines concerning such plans, and (b) be precleared by the Compliance Officer. In preclearing the\nestablishment, operation, modification or termination of a trading plan, neither the Company nor the Compliance Officer will be responsible for determining whether the plan is\nin compliance with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1(c). Compliance with Rule 10b5-1(c) is solely your responsibility.\nCompany Assistance\nIf you have a question about this policy or whether it applies to a particular transaction, contact our Compliance Officer for additional guidance. The Compliance Officer is the\nCompany’s Senior Vice President, Legal, (334) 673-9763.\nExhibit 19.2\nCONSTRUCTION PARTNERS, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL POLICY CONCERNING TRADING IN COMPANY SECURITIES\nBY CERTAIN DESIGNATED PERSONS\nThis policy supplements our Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others. This policy applies to certain designated\npersons. If you are subject to this policy, we will notify you and provide you with a copy of this policy. After you have read this policy, please sign the Certification that is\nattached to this policy and return it to the Compliance Officer. You will also be asked to recertify your compliance with this policy annually.\nPersons subject to this supplemental policy\nThis supplemental policy applies to:\n• each director of Construction Partners, Inc. (the “Company”);\n• each officer of the Company who has been designated by our board of directors as an “executive officer” for purposes of the reporting requirements and trading\nrestrictions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”); and\n• any additional persons that the Company may from time to time designate as being subject to this policy because of their position with the Company and access to\nmaterial nonpublic information.\nWe will notify you if you are subject to this supplemental policy. We refer to persons subject to this supplemental policy as “Designated Persons.”\nIf you are a Designated Person, then this policy also applies to your family members who reside with you, anyone else who lives with you and any other person or\nentity whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are subject to your control. You are responsible for making sure that these other persons and entities\ncomply with this policy.\nAdditional trading restrictions that apply to Designated Persons\nIf you are a Designated Person, you are subject to all of the requirements of our Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to\nOthers. In addition, you are subject to the following restrictions:\n• You may not trade in Company securities outside of a trading window. For purposes of this policy, a “trading window” will commence after the close of trading two\nfull trading days following the Company’s widespread public release of quarterly operating results and end after the close of trading on the tenth calendar day prior to the\nend of the fiscal quarter (or, if such tenth day is not a trading day, after the close of trading on the immediately preceding trading day).\n• Even during a trading window, you may not trade during a blackout period. You may not trade in Company securities during any special blackout periods that the\nCompliance Officer may designate with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chief Financial Officer if the Chief Executive Officer is\nunavailable). You may not disclose to any outside third party that a special blackout period has been designated.\n• You may not trade during a trading window without prior approval. During a trading window, you may trade in Company securities only after obtaining the\napproval of the Compliance Officer. If you decide to engage in a transaction involving Company securities during a trading window, you must notify the Compliance\nOfficer in writing of the amount and nature of the proposed trade(s) at least two business days prior to the proposed transaction, and certify in writing that you are not in\npossession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company. You must not engage in the transaction unless and until the Compliance Officer provides his\napproval in writing. Any determination by the Compliance Officer to disapprove a proposed trade will require the concurrence of the Chief Executive Officer (or if the\nChief Executive Officer is unavailable, the Audit Committee or the Chief Financial Officer). The foregoing functions of the Compliance Officer will be undertaken by\nthe Chief Executive Officer in the case of proposed trades by the Compliance Officer. Proposed trades by the Chief Executive Officer will require approval by any of (i)\nthe Compliance Officer, (ii) the Chief Financial Officer or (iii) the Audit Committee of the Board. The existence of these approval procedures does not in any way\nobligate the Compliance Officer to approve any transaction.\n• Except as permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), you may not trade in Company equity securities during a pension\nplan blackout period. If you are an executive officer or director, you may not trade or transfer during any pension fund blackout period any equity security of the\nCompany that you acquired in connection with your service as an officer or director, except to the extent such trade or transfer is permitted by SEC rules. A pension plan\nblackout period is generally any period of more than three consecutive business days under an individual account plan during which purchases or sales of Company\nequity securities are prohibited under the plan (whether by us or a fiduciary of the plan), excluding certain regularly scheduled blackouts and blackouts imposed solely in\nconnection with certain corporate transactions such as mergers. Any profits made by you in violation of this proscription are recoverable by us. We will notify plan\nparticipants, directors, officers and the SEC in advance of any pension plan blackout period.\n• You may not trade in puts or calls or engage in short sales with respect to Company securities. Trading in “puts” and “calls” (publicly traded options to sell or buy\nstock) and engaging in short sales are often perceived as involving insider trading and they may focus your attention on the Company’s short-term performance rather\nthan its long-term objectives. In addition, Section 16(c) of the Exchange Act prohibits officers and directors from engaging in short sales. Therefore, transactions in puts,\ncalls and other derivative securities with respect to Company securities on an exchange or in any other organized market are prohibited by this policy, as are short sales of\nCompany securities.\n• You may not hold Company securities in a margin account, and you may not, without prior approval, pledge Company securities as collateral for any other\nloan. Because a broker is permitted to sell securities in a margin account if the customer fails to meet a margin call, the securities can be sold at a time when the customer\nis aware of material nonpublic information about the Company. Also, a foreclosure sale under any other loan could also occur at a time when the borrower has nonpublic\ninformation about us. Therefore, you may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan. An exception to this\nprohibition may be granted in the case of a non-margin loan where you are able to clearly demonstrate the financial ability to repay the loan without resorting to the\npledged securities. A request for any such exception must be made to the Compliance Officer at least 10 days in advance of entering into the pledge agreement.\nExceptions to this Policy\nThe trading restrictions in this supplemental policy do not apply to those transactions under Company benefit plans that are not subject to the Policy Prohibiting Insider\nTrading and Unauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others. Those transactions are discussed in that policy under the heading “Exceptions to this policy for certain\ntransactions under Company benefit plans.” The trading restrictions in this supplemental policy also do not apply to trades pursuant to an approved pre-arranged trading plan\nprovided that you enter into the plan during a trading window and the plan otherwise meets the conditions for such plans set forth in the Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading and\nUnauthorized Disclosure of Information to Others.\nIn addition, specific exceptions to this policy may be made when the person requesting approval does not possess material non-public information, personal\ncircumstances warrant the exception and the exception would not otherwise contravene the law or the purposes of this policy. Any request for an exception should be directed to\nthe Compliance Officer.\nInformation about the Compliance Officer\nWe have designated the Company’s Senior Vice President, Legal as the Compliance Officer for this policy. His telephone number is (334) 673-9763. If you have any\nquestions about this policy, you should contact the Compliance Officer.\nExhibit 21.1\nConstruction Partners, Inc.\nList of Subsidiaries\nSubsidiary Jurisdiction of Incorporation/Formation Other Trade Names\nC.W.

If the Participant ceases Continuous Service for any reason the Participant will immediately forfeit the\nRestricted Shares standing in the name of the Participant on the books of the Company that have not vested and as to which restrictions have not lapsed (“Unvested Shares”) and\nsuch Unvested Shares will be cancelled as outstanding shares of Stock. The term “Continuous Service” means the uninterrupted service of a Participant with the Company or an\nAffiliate as an Employee, Director or Consultant. A Participant’s Continuous Service will not be deemed interrupted or terminated merely because of a change in the capacity in\nwhich the Participant renders service, such as a change in status from Employee to Consultant or Director, or a change in the entity for which the Participant renders service,\nsuch as from the Company to an Affiliate, so long as there is no interruption or termination of the Participant’s service. The Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion,\nmay determine whether Continuous Service will be considered interrupted in the case of any approved leave of absence, including sick leave, military leave or any other\npersonal or family leave of absence.\n(a) Forfeiture of Unvested Shares. If Unvested Shares do not become vested on or before the expiration of the period during which the applicable vesting\nconditions must occur, such Unvested Shares will be automatically forfeited and cancelled as outstanding shares of Stock immediately on the occurrence of the event or\nperiod after which such Unvested Shares may no longer become vested.\n(b) Restriction on Transfer of Unvested Shares. The Participant is not permitted to transfer, assign, grant a lien or security interest in, pledge,\nhypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Unvested Shares, except as permitted by this Agreement.\n4. Holding of Unvested Shares. The Company will hold all of the Unvested Shares in its custody until they become vested, at which time such vested Restricted Shares\nwill no longer constitute Unvested Shares. If requested by the Company, the Participant shall execute and deliver to the Company, concurrently with the execution of this\nAgreement (or, if requested by the Company, from time to time thereafter during the Restricted Period) blank stock powers for use in connection with the transfer to the\nCompany or its designee of Unvested Shares that do not become vested. On the lapse of the forfeiture conditions and non-transferability restrictions thereon the Company will\nrelease the shares of Stock that become vested to the Participant.\n5. Rights as a Stockholder, Dividends. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Restricted\nShares, including the right to vote the Restricted Shares and to receive any dividends thereon; provided that any dividends paid with respect to Unvested Shares will be held by\nthe Company and will not be paid to the Participant until the Unvested Shares with respect to which the dividends were paid become vested and are no longer subject to\nforfeiture and restrictions on transfer. If the Unvested Shares to which dividends held by the Company relate are subsequently forfeited, such dividends will automatically be\nforfeited by the Participant and returned to the Company.\n6. Compliance with Laws and Regulations. The issuance and transfer of Stock is subject to the Company’s and the Participant’s full compliance, to the satisfaction of\nthe Company and its counsel, with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any securities exchange on\nwhich the Stock may be listed at the time of such issuance or transfer. The Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the shares of\nStock with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission, foreign securities regulatory authority or any securities exchange to effect such\ncompliance.\n7. Tax Withholding\n(a) As a condition to the release of shares of Stock and lapse of restrictions on transfer, no later than the first to occur of (i) the date as of which all or any of the\nRestricted Shares vest and the restrictions on their transfer lapse or (ii) the date required by Section 7(b), the Participant must pay to the Company any federal, state or\nlocal taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares that vest. In addition to the Company’s right to withhold from any compensation paid to\nthe Participant by the Company, the Participant may provide for payment of withholding taxes in full by cash or check or, if the Committee permits, by one or more of\nthe alternative methods of payment set forth in the Plan.\n(b) The Participant may elect, within 30 days of the Date of Grant, to make a Section 83(b) Election include in gross income for federal income tax purposes, an\namount equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant of the Restricted Shares, less the amount paid, if any, by the Participant (other than in the form of\nservices) for the Restricted Shares. In connection with any such election, the Participant must promptly provide the Company with a copy of the election as filed with the\nInternal Revenue Service and pay to the Company, or make such other arrangements satisfactory to the Committee to pay to the Company based on the Fair Market\nValue of the Restricted Shares on the Date of Grant, any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares at the time of\nthe election. If the Participant fails to make such payments, the Company will have the right to deduct from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Participant, to the\nextent permitted by law, any federal, state or local taxes required to be withheld with respect to the Restricted Shares.\n8. No Right to Continued Service.

SUCH PUBLIC RESALE AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS ARE BINDING ON TRANSFEREES OF THESE SHARES.\nThe Company will remove the above legend at such time as the shares of Stock in question are no longer subject to restrictions on public resale and transfer under this\nAgreement. Any legends required by applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws will be removed at such time as such legends are no longer required.\n(b) Stop-Transfer Instructions. To ensure compliance with the restrictions imposed by this Agreement, the Company may issue appropriate “stop-transfer”\ninstructions to its transfer agent, if any, and if the Company transfers its own Stock, it may make appropriate notations to the same effect in its own records.\n(c) Refusal to Transfer. The Company will not be required (i) to transfer on its books any Restricted Shares that have been sold or otherwise transferred in\nviolation of this Agreement; or (ii) to treat as owner of the Restricted Shares, or to accord the right to vote or pay dividends to, any purchaser or other transferee to whom\nthe Restricted Shares have been transferred.\n13.
