(Nasdaq:LPTX), a biotechnology company focused on developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Leap Highlights:**\n\n  * Completed enrollment in the expanded randomized controlled Part B of the Phase 2 DeFianCe study evaluating DKN-01, Leap's anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody, in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy in second-line patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC); data expected in mid-2025\n  * Patient follow-up continuing in the randomized controlled Part C of the Phase 2 DisTinGuish study evaluating DKN-01 in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in first-line patients with advanced gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) and gastric cancer; data expected in late 2024 or early 2025\n  * Initiated development of FL-501, Leap's anti-GDF-15 monoclonal antibody\n\n\n\n\"We have made significant progress advancing our pipeline this quarter, including the completion of enrollment in the expanded Part B of the Phase 2 DeFianCe study of DKN-01 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer,\" said Douglas E. Onsi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Leap. \"We look forward to sharing initial randomized controlled data from the DisTinGuish study and the DeFianCe study in the coming months. In addition, based on positive preclinical data, we are enthusiastically moving FL-501 into development. With a strong cash position that is expected to fund operations into Q2 2026, Leap is well positioned for continued success and long-term growth to deliver personalized medicines to patients fighting against cancer.\"\n\n**_DKN-01 Development Update_**\n\n  * **_Enrollment completed in the expanded randomized controlled Part B of the DeFianCe study evaluating DKN-01 in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced CRC._** Part B of the DeFianCe study ([NCT05480306](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4301043-1&h=4290981255&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05480306&a=NCT05480306)) is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label study of DKN-01 in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced CRC who have received one prior systemic therapy. Part B of the study enrolled 188 patients. The Company expects to report initial data in mid-2025.\n  * **_Patient follow-up continuing in the randomized controlled Part C of the DisTinGuish study evaluating DKN-01 in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in patients with GEJ and gastric cancer, with initial data expected in late 2024 or early 2025_**. Part C of the DisTinGuish study ([NCT0436380](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4301043-1&h=2388844325&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4058714-1%26h%3D1879686480%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fclinicaltrials.gov%252Fstudy%252FNCT04363801%26a%3DNCT0436380&a=NCT0436380)) is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, open-label study of DKN-01 in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy in first-line, HER-2 negative patients with GEJ and gastric cancer. Part C of the study enrolled 170 patients. The Company expects to report initial data in late 2024 or early 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Pipeline Update:_**\n\n  * **_Advancing FL-501 into development as a potential best-in-class anti-GDF-15 antibody with promising preclinical data._** FL-501 is a potential best-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to neutralize GDF-15 to treat patients with cachexia and other GDF-15-driven diseases. FL-501 may also enhance the activity of the immune system in the tumor micro-environment. FL-501 was engineered for higher target affinity and a longer plasma half-life compared to competing therapies. In preclinical cachexia models, FL-501 increased body weight and restored muscle mass.\n\n\n\n**_Selected Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\nNet Loss was $18.2 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $13.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in research and development expenses. \n\nResearch and development expenses were $14.9 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $11.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $3.4 million was primarily due to an increase of $1.7 million in manufacturing costs related to clinical trial material and manufacturing campaigns, and an increase of $0.8 million in clinical trial costs due to patient enrollment, the duration of patients on study, the enhancement of correlative studies, increase in site activity associated with Part C of the DisTinGuish study, and the expansion of the size of Part B of the DeFianCe study. There was also an increase of $0.5 million in consulting fees associated with research and development activities and an increase of $0.4 million in payroll and other related expenses due to an increase in headcount of our research and development full-time employees.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $2.9 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease of $0.4 million in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, was due to a $0.4 million decrease in professional fees.\n\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $62.8 million at September 30, 2024.\n\n**About Leap Therapeutics** Leap Therapeutics (Nasdaq: LPTX) is focused on developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics.

(Nasdaq: LPTX), a biotechnology company focused on developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics, today announced that enrollment of 188 patients has been completed in the randomized controlled Part B of the DeFianCe study evaluating DKN-01, Leap's anti-Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) antibody, in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\n\"The completion of enrollment in Part B of the DeFianCe study marks a significant achievement and highlights the enthusiasm in the potential of DKN-01 from both patients and healthcare providers,\" said Cynthia Sirard, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Leap. \"The encouraging data from Part A of the study which showed clinically meaningful response rates and durable tumor reductions, as well as a favorable safety profile in advanced CRC patients, provides a strong foundation to the expanded Part B of the study. We look forward to sharing initial data from Part B, including the subpopulation of patients with left-sided CRC, in mid 2025.\"\n\nThe DeFianCe study ([NCT05480306](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4265405-1&h=1106738261&u=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT05480306&a=NCT05480306)) is a Phase 2, open-label, global study of DKN-01 in combination with standard of care bevacizumab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced CRC who have received one prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Part B of the study expanded from a 130 to a 188-patient randomized controlled trial, with the primary endpoint being progression free survival (PFS). An additional primary endpoint will measure PFS in the subpopulation of patients with left-sided CRC. Secondary objectives include objective response rate, duration of response, and overall survival.\n\n**About Leap Therapeutics**Leap Therapeutics (Nasdaq: LPTX) is focused on developing targeted and immuno-oncology therapeutics.
