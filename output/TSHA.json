(Nasdaq: TSHA) (Taysha or the Company), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We are pleased with the progress made with the FDA on further elucidating the potential regulatory pathway for TSHA-102 as we advanced discussions on the trial design, endpoints and potential use of an established natural history dataset for Part B of our REVEAL trials. Additionally, we aligned on a meeting cadence to expedite the development plan for TSHA-102,” said Sean P. Nolan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Taysha. “We are in a strong position with CMC, having obtained FDA approval to use the pivotal product in our REVEAL trials based on the successful demonstration of analytical comparability. Subsequently, we released the pivotal product manufactured with the final commercial manufacturing process that we intend to use in Part B.”\n\nMr. Nolan continued, “Clinical data presented from the adult patients with the most advanced stage of the disease treated with the low dose of TSHA-102 indicate a pattern of early clinical improvements and functional gains across multiple domains within four weeks post-treatment that persisted and strengthened over time. As the pediatric data mature, we anticipate that the early clinical improvements and functional gains observed should also persist and strengthen over time in the pediatric patients treated with TSHA-102. We look forward to reporting longer-term data from the low dose cohort and data from the high dose cohort of both REVEAL trials in the first half of 2025. We plan to continue working closely with the FDA through the RMAT mechanism to solidify the regulatory pathway for TSHA-102 based on the totality of data and remain focused on execution as we prepare for what we expect to be an impactful year ahead.”\n\n**Recent Corporate and TSHA-102 Program Highlights**\n\n  * **Completed Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) Type B Meeting.** Advanced discussions on regulatory pathway for TSHA-102 following initial RMAT Type B multidisciplinary meeting with the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n    * Advanced discussions with the FDA on trial design, endpoints and potential use of an established natural history dataset for Part B of the REVEAL Phase 1/2 trials\n    * Based on FDA feedback from ongoing discussions, the Company intends to focus on objective measures that clinically capture functional gains; the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) will not be included as a primary or secondary endpoint in Part B of the REVEAL trials\n    * Aligned with the FDA on the Company’s proposed meeting cadence to expedite the development and review of TSHA-102 and on the adequacy of the nonclinical data package submitted to date to support Biologics License Application submission\n  * **Reached FDA Alignment on Commercial Manufacturing Process.** Completed Type D Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) meeting with the FDA regarding TSHA-102 \n    * The FDA approved use of the pivotal product in the REVEAL trials based on the successful demonstration of analytical comparability between the clinical product and the product derived from the final commercial manufacturing process\n    * The Company released the pivotal product manufactured with the final commercial manufacturing process for use in Part B of the REVEAL Phase 1/2 trials\n    * The FDA endorsed the intended commercial manufacturing process, proposed analytical methods, and corresponding qualification and validation plans, including mechanism of action potency release assays\n  * **High Dose of TSHA-102 was Generally Well Tolerated.** TSHA-102 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first two adolescent/adult patients as of 20 and nine weeks, respectively, and in the first pediatric patient as of six weeks\n  * **Continued Enrollment in High Dose Cohorts.** Received Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) approval to continue with enrollment in cohort two (high dose, 1x1015 total vector genomes (vg)) across both REVEAL Phase 1/2 trials, following review of available clinical data from the first two adolescent/adult patients and the first pediatric patient treated with the high dose of TSHA-102 \n    * Dosed the third adolescent/adult patient in cohort two and enrolled the second pediatric patient in cohort two, with dosing scheduled for the current quarter\n  * **Presented Positive Previously Disclosed Clinical Data on Low Dose TSHA-102.** Clinical data from cohort one (low dose, 5.7x1014 total vg) in both the ongoing REVEAL Phase 1/2 adolescent/adult trial and the REVEAL Phase 1/2 pediatric trial were presented during an oral presentation at the 9th World Rett Syndrome Congress in October 2024\n    * **Adolescent/Adult Trial (n=2):**\n      * Generally well tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of 52 and 36 weeks for patient one and two, respectively\n      * Early and consistent clinical improvements and functional gains demonstrated across multiple clinical domains (fine and gross motor skills, communication/socialization, autonomic function and seizure events) as early as four weeks post-treatment, with sustained and new improvements through 52- and 25-weeks post-treatment for patient one and two, respectively, based on clinician and caregiver assessments and video evidence\n    * **Pediatric Trial (n=2):**\n      * Generally well tolerated with no SAEs related to TSHA-102 or DLTs as of 22 and 11 weeks for patient one and two, respectively\n      * Early and consistent clinical improvements and functional gains demonstrated across multiple clinical domains (fine and gross motor skills, communication/socialization, autonomic function and seizure events) as early as four weeks post-treatment, with sustained and new improvements through 12- and eight-weeks post-treatment for patient one and two, respectively, based on clinician and caregiver assessments and video evidence\n  * **Presented Biodistribution Data Further Supporting the Clinical Potential of Intrathecal Delivery.** Data from an analysis of 28 non-human primates (NHP) across five studies evaluating AAV9 gene therapy delivery were presented during a poster presentation at the 31st Annual Congress of the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy in October 2024\n    * Both intrathecal and intra-cisterna magna administration showed comparable, consistent and widespread biodistribution of AAV9 vector throughout the brain and spinal cord regions in NHPs\n    * Findings reaffirm the clinical potential of intrathecal administration as an effective, safe and minimally invasive delivery approach for broad targeting of the CNS that has potential for outpatient delivery in both children and adults\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones**\n\n**REVEAL Adolescent and Adult Trial**\n\n  * Safety and efficacy data in cohort two (high dose; n=3) and an update on safety and efficacy data in cohort one (low dose; n=2) expected in the first half of 2025\n\n\n\n**REVEAL Pediatric Trial**\n\n  * Safety and efficacy data in cohort two (high dose; n=3) and an update on safety and efficacy data in cohort one (high dose; n=2) expected in the first half of 2025\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Research and Development Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $14.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.8 million for the three months ending September 30, 2023. The $3.1 million increase was driven by an $0.8 million increase in GMP batch activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which is representative of the intended commercial manufacturing process for TSHA-102 in Rett syndrome. Additionally, compensation for R&D employees increased as a result of higher headcount, and this was partially offset by lower consultant and contractor expenses.\n\n**General and Administrative Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $0.7 million was primarily due to the decrease in issuance costs allocated to the liability-classified 2023 pre-funded warrants associated with the August 2023 financing.\n\n**Net loss:** Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $25.5 million, or $0.1 per share, compared to a net loss of $117.1 million, or $0.93 per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The reduction in net loss in 2024 was primarily due to a non-cash loss of $100.5 million recorded in 2023 from a change in fair value of warrant liability from the 2023 pre-funded warrants associated with the August 2023 financing.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents:** As of September 30, 2024, Taysha had $157.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Taysha expects that its current cash resources will support planned operating expenses and capital requirements into the fourth quarter of 2026.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information** Taysha management will hold a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. ET to review its financial and operating results and provide a corporate update. The dial-in number for the conference call is 877-407-0792 (U.S./Canada) or 201-689-8263 (international). The conference ID for all callers is 13748703.

Designed as a one-time treatment, TSHA-102 aims to address the genetic root cause of the disease by delivering a functional form of _MECP2_ to cells in the CNS. TSHA-102 utilizes a novel miRNA-Responsive Auto-Regulatory Element (miRARE) technology designed to mediate levels of _MECP2_ in the CNS on a cell-by-cell basis without risk of overexpression. TSHA-102 has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Fast Track and Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA, Orphan Drug designation from the European Commission and Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway designation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\n\n**About Rett Syndrome** Rett syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked _MECP2_ gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is essential for regulating neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. The disorder is characterized by loss of communication and hand function, slowing and/or regression of development, motor and respiratory impairment, seizures, intellectual disabilities and shortened life expectancy. Rett syndrome progression is divided into four key stages, beginning with early onset stagnation at 6 to 18 months of age followed by rapid regression, plateau and late motor deterioration. Rett syndrome primarily occurs in females and is one of the most common genetic causes of severe intellectual disability. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies that treat the genetic root cause of the disease. Rett syndrome caused by a pathogenic/likely pathogenic _MECP2_ mutation is estimated to affect between 15,000 and 20,000 patients in the U.S., EU, and U.K.\n\n**About Taysha Gene Therapies**Taysha Gene Therapies (Nasdaq: TSHA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system.

(Nasdaq: TSHA) (Taysha or the Company), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), today announced that it will present biodistribution data from an analysis of 28 non-human primates (NHP) evaluating the delivery of AAV9 gene therapy vectors across five different studies using intrathecal (IT) delivery by lumbar puncture (four studies) or intra-cisterna magna (ICM) injection (one study). The data will be presented during a poster presentation at the upcoming 31st Annual Congress of the European Society of Gene & Cell Therapy (ESGCT), taking place in Rome, Italy from October 22-25, 2024. These findings reinforce Taysha’s clinical development approach utilizing IT administration to deliver AAV-based gene therapies designed to treat the genetic root cause of CNS diseases, including the TSHA-102 program in clinical evaluation for children, adolescents and adults living with Rett syndrome.\n\n“Findings from an analysis across five NHP studies showed that both IT and ICM administration led to comparable, consistent and widespread biodistribution of AAV9 vector throughout the brain and spinal cord regions,” said Sukumar Nagendran, M.D., President and Head of Research & Development at Taysha. “Importantly, these findings further support the clinical potential of IT administration as an effective, safe and minimally invasive delivery approach for broad targeting of the CNS that has potential for outpatient use in both children and adults. We believe the NHP biodistribution data, together with our additional preclinical data, reaffirm our clinical development strategy utilizing IT administration and provide translational support for the broad clinical effect reported following treatment with TSHA-102 in both our REVEAL adolescent/adult trial and REVEAL pediatric trial.\"\n\n**Poster presentation details are as follows:**\n\n**Title** : Broad CNS Biodistribution of AAV9-based Gene Therapies Delivered by Intrathecal Lumbar Puncture in Non-Human Primates\n\n**Presenters** : Nino Devidze, MS, Ph.D., Clinical Development Lead and Emdadul Haque, Ph.D., Senior Director, Translational Sciences at Taysha Gene Therapies\n\n**Date and Time** : Wednesday October 23, 2024, from 13:30 to 15:00 CEST\n\n**Poster Session** : CNS & Sensory Diseases\n\n**Poster Number** : P0284\n\nAdditional details on the meeting can be found at the 31st Annual ESGCT Congress [website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ocx5tgPg0vMNkosglAkuOiq1YeP0aKqtqluvo-V6HcOYNwPDfWILL0rcD80M4xOBQSDho2DJwZo4n_HIvIZ02A==).\n\n**About TSHA-102** TSHA-102 is a self-complementary intrathecally delivered AAV9 investigational gene transfer therapy in clinical evaluation for Rett syndrome. Designed as a one-time treatment, TSHA-102 aims to address the genetic root cause of the disease by delivering a functional form of _MECP2_ to cells in the CNS. TSHA-102 utilizes a novel miRNA-Responsive Auto-Regulatory Element (miRARE) technology designed to mediate levels of _MECP2_ in the CNS on a cell-by-cell basis without risk of overexpression. TSHA-102 has received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, Fast Track and Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the FDA, Orphan Drug designation from the European Commission and Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway designation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\n\n**About Rett Syndrome** Rett syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked _MECP2_ gene encoding methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is essential for regulating neuronal and synaptic function in the brain. The disorder is characterized by loss of communication and hand function, slowing and/or regression of development, motor and respiratory impairment, seizures, intellectual disabilities and shortened life expectancy. Rett syndrome progression is divided into four key stages, beginning with early onset stagnation at 6 to 18 months of age followed by rapid regression, plateau and late motor deterioration. Rett syndrome primarily occurs in females and is one of the most common genetic causes of severe intellectual disability. Currently, there are no approved disease-modifying therapies that treat the genetic root cause of the disease. Rett syndrome caused by a pathogenic/likely pathogenic _MECP2_ mutation is estimated to affect between 15,000 and 20,000 patients in the U.S., EU, and U.K.\n\n**About Taysha Gene Therapies**Taysha Gene Therapies (Nasdaq: TSHA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies for severe monogenic diseases of the central nervous system.
