Key third quarter and recent corporate highlights include:\n\n  * Investigational new drug application approval to initiate ABACUS-2, the Phase 2 study of KIO-301, a novel molecular photoswitch, for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa.\n\n  * Finalized the design of the Phase 2 KLARITY trial of KIO-104, a small molecule targeting the treatment of multiple retinal inflammatory diseases, with submission for trial approval on track for Q4 2024.\n\n  * Ended the quarter with $29.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments plus $1.8 million in collaboration receivables related to the Company's Théa Open Innovation (TOI or Théa) partnership.\n\n  * Expected runway into 2027, excluding any potential partnership milestones.\n\n\n\n\n\"Kiora remains in a strong position with two compelling and innovative drug candidates entering Phase 2 clinical trials and a strong balance sheet to fund development and operations beyond anticipated readouts for both studies,\" said Brian M. Strem, Ph.D., President & Chief Executive Officer of Kiora. \"During the third quarter, we worked diligently to prepare for these trials, which will increase their likelihood of success.\n\n\"Regarding KIO-301, we recently received approval to initiate ABACUS-2, a 36-patient, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multi-dose study in patients with ultra-low vision or no light perception due to retinitis pigmentosa. Based on KIO-301's differentiated mechanism of action as a small molecule, we will enroll patients with any of the known 150-plus underlying gene mutations associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Dosing of the first patient with KIO-301 will begin next year following the completion of the ongoing validation work around functional vision endpoints.\n\n\"Following multiple interactions with the FDA and European regulators, retinal specialists, and patient advocacy groups, it's clear that demonstrating improvement in functional vision is essential for marketing authorization as well as reimbursement. Thus, throughout the third quarter and continuing into the fourth, we've invested time to validate functional vision endpoints, increasing the probability of success of ABACUS-2 and a potential Phase 3 study in the US and Europe. This validation work is being performed in collaboration with our partner Théa, with additional support from the Choroideremia Research Foundation.\n\n\"Our other active program is KIO-104, a potent, locally delivered small molecule that we are developing to treat inflammatory retinal diseases. The goal is to offer patients and providers an alternative to chronic steroid use or systemic anti-inflammatory drugs, both of which often lead to complications. KIO-104 acts by suppressing specific types of T cells and their resulting biomolecules (cytokines) that underlie damaging inflammation. Following a previously successful first-in-man study, we now plan to initiate KLARITY in the first half of next year. This study will be a Phase 2 clinical trial to explore multiple doses of KIO-104 in patients with inflammatory retinal diseases, including posterior non-infectious uveitis and diabetic macular edema. Findings in the study will inform a dose expansion trial in one or more specific indications.\"\n\nKiora's Chief Financial Officer, Melissa Tosca, added, \"We continue to efficiently manage our cash while creating value by investing in our pipeline. Our Théa partnership enables our overall pipeline progress through their reimbursement of our KIO-301 R&D activities, allowing us to invest further in KIO-104. Going forward, we anticipate R&D expenses will increase as we begin patient enrollment in the KLARITY trial. However, we maintain a cash runway into 2027, before any potential partnership milestones, and beyond the expected data readouts from ABACUS-2 and KLARITY.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Highlights**\n\nKiora ended the third quarter of 2024 with $29.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. In addition, the Company recorded $1.8 million in collaboration receivables from TOI for reimbursed R&D expenses and $0.4 million R&D incentive tax credits. The increase in cash position from the prior quarter was due primarily to the receipt of $1.5 million in R&D incentive tax credits.\n\nResearch and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.2 million, before recognizing $0.9 million in reimbursement from Théa. This resulted in net research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 of $1.3 million compared to $1.1 million in R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023, during which time there were no partnership-related reimbursement credits. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to research activities related to KIO-301 and KIO-104.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, no change from the $1.4 million spent in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss was $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net loss of $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in net loss is primarily attributed to a non-cash component, the change in fair value of contingent consideration, of -$1.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 related to the strategic decision to focus on KIO-301 and KIO-104 and halt any continuing development and licensing activities for KIO-201.\n\n**About Kiora Pharmaceuticals**\n\nKiora Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing and commercializing products for the treatment of orphan retinal diseases.

(NASDAQ: KPRX) (\"Kiora\" or the \"Company\") today announced it received regulatory approval to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to investigate KIO-301 for vision restoration in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The ABACUS-2 trial will be a 36 patient, multi-center, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple dose study enrolling patients with ultra-low vision or no light perception regardless of their underlying gene mutation associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Dosing of the first patient with KIO-301 is expected to begin next year following validation of novel functional vision endpoints. These functional assessments may serve as approvable primary endpoints in subsequent registration studies in the United States, Europe and other major regions.\n\n\"There are unfortunately no approved therapies for patients with retinitis pigmentosa,\" said Eric Daniels, M.D., Chief Development Officer at Kiora. \"This study represents a significant step toward addressing this challenge. Prior to submission for approval, we engaged with European and US regulators to incorporate their expectations and guidance for approvable endpoints. Consistent with historical approval in other inherited retinal disease, both regulatory bodies emphasized the need to measure a therapy's effect on everyday functional vision. For this reason, we are investing time upfront to validate the functional endpoints for ABACUS-2, increasing our likelihood of success in a potential single Phase 3 trial for market approval in the US and Europe. This validation work is being performed, in collaboration with our partner Théa Open Innovation, with the support of the Choroideremia Research Foundation as part of a grant to design a standard endpoint for investigational therapies of inherited retinal diseases.\"\n\nKiora has identified and is now contracting with trial sites and clinical investigators at major inherited retinal disease reference centers across Australia. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive KIO-301 intravitreally or control. Treatment will be delivered to both eyes. Participants will be randomized to receive either a high dose (100 micrograms) or low dose (50 micrograms) of KIO-301 and after trial participants receive three consecutive doses (6 weeks apart), they will be followed for three months. Following this phase of the study, patients in the control arm may elect to cross-over into the active arm. Primary endpoints will consist of safety and tolerability, and key efficacy assessments include: functional vision; visual acuity as measured by the Berkeley Rudimentary Vision Test; visual fields as measured by perimetry, and a validated ultra-low vision quality-of-life questionnaire. The trial will be conducted across five centers within Australia.\n\n\"In a short window since entering our partnership with Kiora, tremendous progress has been made on advancing KIO-301 toward ABACUS-2,\" said Dr. Céline Olmiere, Head of Théa Open Innovation. \"What makes KIO-301 compelling is that it appears, based on the Phase 1b data, to have potential for meaningful vision restoration. Further, because of its unique mechanism of action, it has the potential to work across all 150-plus underlying gene mutations associated with retinitis pigmentosa and other inherited retinal diseases.\"\n\nKIO-301 is a small molecule that acts as a light-sensitive photoswitch that has the potential to return vision to patients living with reduced sight due to inherited retinal diseases. The novel compound is activated in the presence of light and deactivated in the absence of light. Because hundreds of gene mutations underlie inherited retinal diseases like retinitis pigmentosa, there is an important need for therapies like KIO-301 that have the potential to act in a gene mutation agnostic manner.\n\nKIO-301 targets and enters specialized cells of the retina (retinal ganglion cells or RGCs) that are located 'downstream' of degenerated rods and cones, the cells normally responsible for converting light to vision. KIO-301, when inside RGCs, is activated by visible light and confers light-sensing capabilities by altering the flow of ions in and out of the cell, thus giving RGCs the ability to facilitate visual processing. This is a reversible process allowing turning on and off the RGCs in the presence and absence of light.\n\n**About Kiora Pharmaceuticals** Kiora Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing and commercializing products for the treatment of retinal diseases. KIO-301 is being developed for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa, choroideremia, and Stargardt disease. It is a molecular photoswitch that has the potential to restore vision in patients with inherited and/or age-related retinal degeneration. KIO-104 is being developed for the treatment of retinal inflammation. It is a next-generation, non-steroidal, immuno-modulatory, and small-molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.\n\nIn addition to news releases and SEC filings, we expect to post information on our website ([www.kiorapharma.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/v1aj0UYg0y)) and social media accounts that could be relevant to investors.
