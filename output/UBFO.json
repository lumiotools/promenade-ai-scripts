As stated in the Notice and above, the Annual Report, this Proxy Statement and form of\nproxy are available to be viewed by shareholders on the internet at: http://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/financialdocs.\nThe matters to be considered and voted upon at the Meeting will be:\n(1) Election of Directors. Electing the following ten (10) persons to the Board of Directors to serve until the 2025 Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders and until their successors are elected and have qualified:\nStanley J.

Ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP to serve as the independent\nregistered public accounting firm for the Company for 2024.\n(3) Other Business. Such other business as may properly come before the Meeting and any adjournments or\npostponements thereof.\nIf you were a shareholder of record at the close of business on March 27, 2024, you may vote at the Meeting.\nOther than the matters set forth on the attached 2024 Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as of the date of this Proxy\nStatement, the Board of Directors knows of no additional matters that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting.\nExecution of a proxy, however, confers to each of Dennis Woods, David Kinross, and Robert Oberg, as the designated proxy\nholders, discretionary authority to vote the shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board on such other business,\nif any, which may properly come before the Meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof, including whether or\nnot to adjourn the Meeting.\n1\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING\nWhy did you provide me this Proxy Statement?\nWe provided you this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to\nvote at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement summarizes the information you need to know to cast an informed vote at the\nMeeting. However, you do not need to attend the Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign, and\nreturn the enclosed proxy card. You may also vote electronically, by telephone, or the internet by following the instructions on\nthe proxy card.\nAlong with this Proxy Statement, we have furnished the Company’s 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for you to view at: http://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/financialdocs. United Security\nBancshares is referred to in this Proxy Statement as the “Company.” The Company’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, United\nSecurity Bank, is referred to in this Proxy Statement as the “Bank.”\nHow will our Annual Meeting be held?\nThis year’s Meeting will be in person at our corporate office at 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, California 93721. You are entitled to\nparticipate in the Meeting if you owned shares of our common stock as of the close of business on March 27, 2024.\nWho is entitled to vote?\nShareholders who were the record owners of the Company’s no-par value common stock (the “Common Stock”) at the close of\nbusiness on March 27, 2024 are entitled to vote. On this record date, there were 17,315,195 shares of the Company’s Common\nStock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Our Common Stock is our only class of outstanding capital stock.\nWhat is the difference between a shareholder of record and a “street name” holder?\nIf your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares.\nIf your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a trust company, trust or other nominee, then the broker, trust\ncompany, or other nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. However, you are still\nconsidered the beneficial owner of those shares and your shares are said to be held in “street name.” Street name holders\ngenerally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the broker, trust company, or other nominee how to vote\ntheir shares using the voting instruction form provided by your broker, trust company, or other nominee. If you hold your\nshares in street name and do not provide voting instructions, your broker, trust company, or other nominee has discretionary\nauthority to vote your shares on the ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as our independent auditor for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024, even in the absence of your specific voting instruction. Those shares will also be counted as\npresent at the Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. However, in the absence of your specific instructions as to how\nto vote, your broker, trust company, or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors\nor any other proposals that may properly come before the Meeting.\nWhat constitutes a quorum?\nA quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence at the Meeting in person or by proxy of the\nholders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction\nof business. Proxies marked as abstaining (including proxies containing broker non-votes) on any matter to be acted upon by\nshareholders will be treated as present at the Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum but will not be counted as votes\ncast on such matters. If there is no quorum, a majority of the shares represented at the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting to\nanother date.\nHow many votes do I have?\nHolders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of Common Stock held in his or her\nname on the books of the Company as of the record date for the Meeting on any matter submitted to the vote of the\nshareholders, except that in connection with the election of directors, the shares are entitled to be voted cumulatively.\nCumulative voting entitles a shareholder to give one nominee as many votes as is equal to the number of directors to be elected\nmultiplied by the number of shares owned by such shareholder, or to distribute his or her votes on the same principle between\n2\ntwo or more nominees as he or she deems appropriate. The ten (10) nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be\nelected.\nPursuant to California law, no shareholder may cumulate votes for a nominee unless the name of the nominee has been placed\nin nomination prior to the voting and the shareholder has given notice at the Meeting prior to the voting of the shareholder’s\nintention to cumulate. If any shareholder gives notice, all shareholders may cumulate their votes.\nThe proxy holders designated in the enclosed proxy card do not, at this time, intend to cumulate votes pursuant to the proxies\nsolicited in this Proxy Statement unless another shareholder gives notice to cumulate, in which case, the proxy holders may\ncumulate votes in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. Therefore, discretionary authority to\ncumulate votes in such event is solicited in this Proxy Statement.\nHow do I vote by proxy?\nWhether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, we urge you to complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and to return it\npromptly in the envelope provided. Returning the proxy card will not affect your right to participate in the Meeting and vote.\nYou may also vote over the internet or by telephone. Instructions for all voting can be found on the Notice and on the back of\nthe proxy card included with this Proxy Statement.\nIf you properly fill in your proxy card and send it to us in time to vote, or vote by internet or telephone, your “proxy\nholders” (the individual(s) named on your proxy card) will vote your shares as you have directed. If you sign the proxy card\nbut do not make specific choices, your proxy holder(s) will vote your shares as recommended by the Board of Directors as\nfollows:\n• “FOR” the election of all ten (10) nominees for director; and\n• “FOR” ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting\nfirm for 2024.\nFor the election of directors (Proposal 1), a shareholder may withhold authority for the proxy holders to vote for any one or\nmore of the nominees by marking the enclosed proxy card in the manner instructed on the proxy card. Unless authority to vote\nfor the nominees is so withheld, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the election of the nominees listed\non the proxy card as directors of the Company. Your proxy holders do not have an obligation to vote for nominees not\nidentified on the preprinted proxy card (i.e., write-in nominees). Should any shareholder attempt to “write in” a vote for a\nnominee not identified on the preprinted card (and described in these proxy materials), your proxy holders will NOT vote the\nshares represented by your proxy card for any such write-in nominee, but will instead vote the shares for any and all other\nindicated nominees. If any of the nominees should be unable or decline to serve, which is not now anticipated, your proxy\nholders will have discretionary authority to vote for a substitute who shall be designated by the present Board of Directors to fill\nthe vacancy. In the event that additional persons are nominated for election as directors, your proxy holders intend to vote all of\nthe proxies in such a manner, in accordance with the cumulative voting, as will assure the election of as many of the nominees\nidentified on the proxy card as possible. In such event, the specific nominees to be voted for will be determined by the proxy\nholders, at their sole discretion.\nIf any other matter is presented (including but not limited to a motion for adjournment or postponement of the Meeting), your\nproxy holders will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors, or, if no recommendation is given, in\naccordance with his or her best judgment. At the time this Proxy Statement was finalized, we knew of no matters which needed\nto be acted on at the Meeting, other than those discussed in this Proxy Statement.\nWhat vote is required to approve each proposal, and what is the effect of withholding authority to vote, broker non-\nvotes, and abstentions?\nThe ten (10) nominees for director who receive the most votes will be elected. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be\ncounted, except for quorum purposes, and will have no effect on the election of directors. If you indicate “WITHHELD” for a\nparticular nominee on your proxy card, your vote will not count either for or against the nominee. Approval for Proposal 2\n(ratification of the appointment of Moss Adams LLP) requires the affirmative vote of: (i) a majority of the votes represented in\nperson or by proxy and voting at the Meeting; and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.\n3\nIf you hold your shares of Common Stock in “street name” (i.e., through a broker or other nominee) you must vote your\nshares through your broker. You should receive a form from your broker asking how you want to vote your shares.\nFollow the instructions on that form to give voting instructions to your broker. Under the rules that govern brokers\nwho are voting with respect to shares held in street name, brokers have the discretion to vote such shares on routine, but\nnot on non-routine, matters. If you fail to instruct your broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares of Common\nStock, your broker or nominee may, in their discretion, vote your shares “FOR” ratification of the appointment of Moss\nAdams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2024, which is\nconsidered a routine matter. HOWEVER, YOUR BROKER MAY NOT VOTE YOUR SHARES “FOR” the election of\nthe nominees for director without your specific direction. A “broker non-vote” occurs when your broker does not vote\non a particular proposal because the broker does not receive instructions from you, as the beneficial owner, and does\nnot have discretionary voting authority. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you return the instructions to your broker or\nnominee. Therefore, if you wish to be represented, you must vote by completing the information which is sent to you by\nyour broker or nominee.\nAssuming a quorum has been established at the Meeting, California law requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares\nrepresented and voting at the Meeting to adopt a proposal (other than the election of directors), unless the vote of a greater\nnumber is required by law or by our Articles of Incorporation. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as shares\nvoting on any proposal. Therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes cast AGAINST the\nproposal to ratify our independent registered public accounting firm. That is, abstentions and broker non-votes will reduce the\nnumber of affirmative votes and therefore reduce the total percentage of votes the proposal might otherwise have received.\nHow do I vote in person?\nIf you plan to attend the Meeting and vote in person, you will be given a ballot form when you arrive. However, it is strongly\nrecommended that you return the proxy card rather than vote in person as this will expedite the vote counting process at the\nMeeting. Please note that if your shares are held in the name of your broker, company, or other nominee, you must\nbring a Power of Attorney from your nominee in order to vote at the Meeting. If your shares are held in street name, you\nwill not be able to vote at the Meeting without the Power of Attorney form.\nMay I vote telephonically or electronically over the internet?\nShareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote either by mail, by telephone, or over the internet.\nSpecial instructions to be followed by any registered shareholder interested in voting via the internet or telephone are set forth\non the Notice and the reverse of your proxy card. The internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate the\nshareholder’s identity and to allow shareholders to vote their shares and confirm that their voting instructions have been\nproperly recorded.\nMay I change my vote after I return my proxy?\nA form of proxy for use at the Meeting is enclosed. If it is executed and returned it may nevertheless be revoked at any time\nbefore it is exercised by: (i) filing with the Secretary of the Company, Susan Quigley, an instrument revoking it or a duly\nexecuted proxy bearing a later date; (ii) appearing and voting in person at the Meeting; or (iii) if you have voted your shares by\ninternet or telephone, recording a different vote, or by signing and returning a proxy card dated as of a date that is later than\nyour last internet or telephone vote. Subject to such revocation, shares represented by a properly executed proxy received in\ntime for the Meeting will be voted by the proxy holders thereof in accordance with the instructions on the proxy. If no\ninstruction is specified with respect to a matter to be acted upon, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted in\nfavor of the election of all ten (10) nominees to the Board of Directors and “FOR” Proposal 2. If any other business is\nproperly presented at the Meeting, the proxy will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Company’s\nBoard of Directors.\nHow may I obtain a separate set of proxy materials or Annual Report to Shareholders?\nIf you share an address with another shareholder, you may receive only one Annual Report to Shareholders and one set of proxy\nmaterials unless you have provided contrary instructions. If you wish to receive a separate Annual Report to Shareholders or a\nseparate set of proxy materials now or in the future, please request the additional copies by calling (888) 683-6030 (toll free);\nby writing to us at United Security Bancshares, 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno, California 93721, Attn: Mr. David Kinross, or by\nemail at dkinross@unitedsecuritybank.com. We undertake to provide any additional copies requested promptly.\n4\nWhat should I do if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?\nSimilarly, if you share an address with another shareholder and have received multiple copies of proxy materials, you may\ncontact us in the same manner or write us at the address set forth above in the previous question to request delivery of a single\ncopy of these materials.\nWhy may I receive multiple voting instruction forms and/or proxy cards?\nIf you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each\nbrokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one\nname, you will receive more than one proxy card. In each case, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and\nvoting instruction form that you receive.\nWho is making the solicitation?\nThis solicitation of proxies is being made by the Board of Directors of the Company. The expense of preparing, assembling,\nprinting and mailing this Proxy Statement and the materials used in the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting will be borne by\nthe Company. The Company does not anticipate this to be a material amount. It is contemplated that proxies will be solicited\nprincipally by mail, but officers, directors, and employees of the Company may solicit proxies personally or by telephone,\nwithout receiving special compensation for such activities. Although there is no formal agreement to do so, the Company may\nreimburse companies, brokerage houses, and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses in\nforwarding these proxy materials to shareholders whose stock in the Company is held of record by such entities.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE\nANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MAY 15, 2024\nThe Proxy Statement and the Annual Report on Form 10-K are available on the Internet\nhttp://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/financialdocs\nVOTING SECURITIES\nThere were issued and outstanding 17,315,195 shares of the Company’s Common Stock on March 27, 2024, which has been\nfixed as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. Each\nholder of Common Stock will be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of Common Stock held of record on\nthe books of the Company as of the record date for the Meeting on any matter submitted to the vote of the shareholders; except,\nthat in connection with the election of directors, the shares may be voted cumulatively if a shareholder present at the Meeting\nhas given notice at the Meeting, prior to the voting, of his or her intention to vote cumulatively. If any shareholder has given\nsuch notice, then all shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors may cumulate their votes. Cumulative voting\nmeans that a shareholder has the right to vote the number of shares he or she owns as of the record date, multiplied by the\nnumber of directors to be elected. This total number of votes may be cast for one nominee or it may be distributed on the same\nprinciple among as many nominees as the shareholder sees fit. If cumulative voting is declared at the Meeting, votes\nrepresented by proxies delivered pursuant to this Proxy Statement may be cumulated in the discretion of the proxy holders, in\naccordance with the recommendations of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nA majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, represented in person or by proxy, is required for a quorum. Nominees\nreceiving the most votes, up to the number of directors to be elected, are elected as directors for the ensuing year. The\naffirmative vote of at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented in person or by proxy and voting at the\nMeeting is required to approve Proposal 2 (ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as the Company’s independent\nregistered public accounting firm for 2024).\nIf you hold Common Stock in “street name” and you fail to instruct your broker or nominee as to how to vote such Common\nStock, your broker or nominee may, in its discretion, vote such Common Stock “FOR” ratification of the selection of Moss\nAdams LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm and auditors of the Company for 2024, but CANNOT vote\n“FOR” the election of directors. IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU VOTE BY RETURNING YOUR PROXY\nCARD BY MAIL, OR VOTE BY USING THE INTERNET OR TELEPHONE.\n5\nSHAREHOLDINGS OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nManagement knows of no person who owns, beneficially or of record, either individually or together with associates, five\npercent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, except as set forth in the table below.

The Company’s Corporate Governance\nPrinciples are available at www.unitedsecuritybank.com within the Investor Relations section.\nBoard of Directors and Committees of the Company\nThe Board of Directors of the Company oversees its business and monitors the performance of management. In accordance\nwith Corporate Governance Principles, our Board of Directors does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors\nkeep themselves informed through, among other things, discussions with the Chief Executive Officer, other key executives, and\nour principal outside advisers (legal counsel, outside auditors, and other consultants), by reading reports and other materials\nprovided by the Company, and by participating in board and committee meetings.\nDuring 2023, the Board of Directors held 11 meetings. During 2023, no director attended less than 75% of all Board of\nDirectors meetings and the meetings of any committee of the Board of Directors on which he or she served.\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors had the following committees: ALCO, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Corporate\nGovernance/Nominating Committee, IT Committee, Loan Committee, Merger and Acquisition Committee, and 401K\nCommittee.\nAttendance at Annual Meetings\nWhile the Company does not have a policy regarding director attendance at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a majority of\nthe Company’s directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nShareholder Communications with the Board\nShareholders who wish to communicate with the Board of Directors as a whole, or with an individual director, may do so by\nemailing the Board of Directors at roberg@unitedsecuritybank.com.\nSelection and Evaluation of Director Nominees\nThe Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and presenting nominees for membership on\nthe Board, as needed, by the following process:\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the qualifications and\nwillingness to continue in service of current members of the Board of Directors.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee identifies if the Board of Directors needs to add new members\nwith specific skills or to fill a vacancy on the Board.\n8\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee initiates a search, working with staff support and seeking input\nfrom the members of the Board and executive management for nominee(s) including existing members that are\nwilling to continue to serve as directors. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee also considers any\nnominee(s) recommended by shareholders.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee identifies a potential slate of nominee(s), after taking into\naccount the criteria discussed in the next section below.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee determines if any Board members have contacts with the\npotential nominee(s).\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee interviews prospective nominee(s) other than existing board\nmembers.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee keeps the Board informed of the selection progress.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee meets to consider and approve its slate of recommended\nnominee(s) also using the criteria discussed in the next section below. The Corporate Governance/Nominating\nCommittee, in evaluating existing directors as nominees and non-directors as nominees, balances the value of\ncontinuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective.\n• The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee presents its slate of recommended nominees to the Board and\nseeks the Board’s endorsement of such nominee(s).\n• There is no third party that is currently paid to assist in identifying or evaluating potential director nominees,\nalthough the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee has sole authority to retain or terminate the services of a\nthird-party search firm to identify director nominees. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee’s process\nfor identifying and evaluating nominees for directors will not materially differ based on whether or not the nominee\nis recommended by a shareholder.\nBoard Diversity\nWhile the Board of Directors does not have a formal diversity policy, it broadly defines diversity to encompass a range of skills\nand expertise sufficient to provide prudent guidance to the Company. In addition to the qualifications and characteristics\ndescribed below, it considers whether the potential Director assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a\ndiversity of background, perspective, and experience. Our Board of Directors also has a broad set of skills necessary for\nproviding oversight to a financial institution, which includes proven leadership, and expertise in agriculture, finance,\naccounting, technology, and capital markets. The table below provides certain highlights of the composition of the Board of\nDirectors and nominees. Each of the categories listed in the below table has meaning as it is used in Nasdaq rule 5605(f):\nBoard Diversity (As of December 31, 2023)\nTotal Number of Directors or Nominees 10\nDid not\nPart I: Gender Identity Female Male Non-Binary Disclose\nGender\nDirectors 3 6 — 1\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American — — — —\nAsian — — — —\nHispanic or Latinx 1 — — —\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander — — — —\nWhite 2 5 — —\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities — 1 — —\nLGBTQ+ — — — —\nDid not Disclose — — — 1\nDirector Independence\nIt is the policy of the Board of Directors that a significant majority of its members be independent from management, and the\nBoard has adopted director independence standards that meet the listing standards and applicable rules of The “NASDAQ Stock\nMarket, LLC” (NASDAQ). These independence standards are included in our Corporate Governance Principles which can be\nfound on the Company’s website at www.unitedsecuritybank.com within the Investor Relations section.\n9\nIn accordance with our Corporate Governance Principles, the Board undertook its annual review of director independence.\nDuring this review, the Board considered any and all commercial and charitable relationships of directors, including\ntransactions and relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and the\nBank. Following the review, the Board affirmatively determined, by applying the director independence standards contained in\nthe Corporate Governance Principles, that each of our directors nominated for election at this Meeting (Stanley J. Cavalla, Tom\nEllithorpe, Jay Gill, Heather Hammack, Kenneth D. Newby, Susan Quigley, Brian Tkacz, and Dora Westerlund) is independent\nof the Company and its management in that none has a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company, with the\nexception of Dennis R. Woods, who is considered an inside director because of his employment as President and CEO of the\nCompany, and Nabeel Mahmood, who was temporarily employed as an interim Chief Information Officer of the Bank during\n2022. In addition, all members of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance /\nNominating Committee satisfy the standards of independence applicable to members of such committees established under\napplicable law, the listing standards and applicable rules of NASDAQ, and the director independence standards set forth in the\nCompany’s Corporate Governance Principles.\nNomination of Directors\nThe Board of Directors maintains a Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, which is responsible for assisting the Board\nof Directors in director selection, as well as review and consideration of developments in corporate governance practices. This\ncommittee consists solely of independent directors. This committee will also review director nominees submitted by\nshareholders. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee is responsible for annually reviewing and evaluating, in\nconjunction with the Board of Directors, the appropriate skills and characteristics required for Board of Directors members in\nthe context of the current composition of the Board of Directors and goals for nominees to the Board of Directors, including\nnominees who are current directors.\nThe Board of Director’s policies with respect to director nominees have been to consider, among other factors: (a) the business\nexperience of the nominee; (b) his or her reputation and influence in the community and standards of moral and ethical\nresponsibility; (c) availability and willingness to devote time to fully participate in the work of the Board of Directors and its\ncommittees; and (d) commitment to the Company as evidenced by personal investment. Directors are expected to have\ndemonstrated notable achievement in business, education, or public service; possess the education and experience to make a\nsignificant contribution to the Board of Directors; bring a range of skills, diverse perspective, and background to the Board of\nDirectors; and serve as active resources for referrals and business development.\nThe Board of Directors will consider properly submitted nominees to the Board of Directors proposed by shareholders,\nalthough the Board has no formal policy with regard to shareholder nominees as it considers all nominees on their merits, as\ndiscussed above. Any shareholder nominations proposed for consideration by the Board should include the nominee’s name\nand qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to:\nDennis R. Woods, Chairman of the Board\nUnited Security Bancshares\n2126 Inyo Street\nFresno, California 93721\nIn addition, the Bylaws of the Company permit shareholders to nominate directors for consideration at an Annual Meeting of\nShareholders. For a description of the process for nominating directors in accordance with the Bylaws, please see the Notice of\nAnnual Meeting of Shareholders accompanying this Proxy Statement.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board of Directors is led by Dennis Woods, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. The\ndecision as to who should serve as Chairman of the Board, and who should serve as Chief Executive Officer, and whether those\noffices should be combined or separate, is properly the responsibility of our Board. The members of our Board possess\nconsiderable experience and unique knowledge of the challenges and opportunities we face, and are in the best position to\nevaluate our needs and how best to organize the capabilities of the directors and executive officers to meet those needs. The\nBoard believes that the most effective leadership structure entails Mr. Wood’s continued service as both Chairman of the Board\nand Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Woods was the founding Chairman of the Bank and has been the Company’s Chairman of\nthe Board and Chief Executive Officer since 2001. The Board of Directors believes that he is uniquely qualified through his\nexperience and expertise to be the person who generally sets the agenda for, and leads discussions of, strategic issues for our\nBoard. He was one of the key individuals behind our formation and his leadership was instrumental in the drafting and\n10\nimplementing of our strategic plan as well as our mission and vision statements. Mr. Woods’ leadership, as both the Chairman\nof the Board and as the Chief Executive Officer, continues to ensure that we remain dedicated to and focused on our mission.\nLike many companies, our Board of Directors has an Executive Committee and other committees through which our Board of\nDirectors accomplishes most of its corporate governance role, including new director and succession planning. Some of the\ncommittees are chartered to undertake significant activities and are made up entirely of independent directors.\nIn addition, our independent directors participated in 11 executive sessions during the year, in which our Chairman of the Board\nand Chief Executive Officer does not participate. Any independent director may request additional executive sessions at any\nmeeting. Our executive sessions are led by our Lead Director, Ken Newby, who is an independent director recommended by\nour Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee and appointed by our Board. The Lead Director is responsible for setting\nthe agenda for executive sessions and leading them.\nBoard Role in Risk Oversight\nRisk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. The Company\nfaces a number of risks, including interest rate risk and credit, market, and operational risks, such as the impact of competition.\nManagement is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks the Company faces, while the Chief Risk Officer and\nthe Board, as a whole and through its committees, have responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk-\noversight role, the Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the Bank’s risk management policies and procedures are\nadequate and functioning as designed.\nThe Audit Committee engages in regular discussions with the Chief Risk Officer, the Company’s executive officers, and other\nCompany officers as the Audit Committee may deem appropriate related to risk management. The committees consider risks\nwithin their areas of responsibility; for instance, the Compensation Committee considers risks that may result from changes in\ncompensation programs.\nCorporate Governance/Nominating Committee\nThe Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee met once during 2023. During 2023, the committee members were Mr.\nEllithorpe, Mr. Mackovak (until his retirement from the Board in June 2023), and Mr. Tkacz. The Corporate Governance/\nNominating Committee currently consists of Mr. Ellithorpe, Ms. Hammack, Mr. Tkacz, and Ms. Westerlund, who are all\nconsidered independent as defined by the applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. The charter of the Corporate Governance/\nNominating Committee can be found on the Company’s website at www.unitedsecuritybank.com by clicking “About Us” and\nthen “Governance.”\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee held two formal meeting in 2023. The Compensation Committee consists of two (2) directors,\nall of whom are independent as defined by the applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. During 2023, the members of the\nCompensation Committee were Ms. Hammack and Mr. Tkacz. The Compensation Committee reviews human resource\npolicies, establishes the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, reviews salary\nrecommendations, grants stock based compensation, and approves other personnel matters, which are in excess of\nmanagement’s authority.\nNone of the Company’s executive officers served on the Compensation Committee and none of the members of the\nCompensation Committee serves or has served as an officer or employee of the Company. The charter of the Compensation\nCommittee can be found on the Company’s website at www.unitedsecuritybank.com by clicking “About Us” and then\n“Governance.”\nAudit Committee\nDuring 2023, the Audit Committee met twelve (12) times. During 2023, the Audit Committee consisted of Ms. Quigley\n(Chairperson), Mr. Newby, and Mr. Ellithorpe, all of whom were independent as defined by the applicable NASDAQ and SEC\nrules. Ms. Quigley and Mr. Newby are deemed by the Company to be audit committee financial experts pursuant to the\napplicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Ms. Quigley and Mr. Newby have an understanding of generally accepted\naccounting principles (GAAP) and have the ability and experience to prepare, audit, evaluate and analyze financial statements\nwhich present the breadth and level of complexity of issues that are reasonably expected to be raised by the Company’s\n11\nfinancial statements. For more information on Ms. Quigley and Mr. Newby’s qualifications and business expertise, please see\ntheir profiles under “PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS,” herein.\nThe Audit Committee oversees the Company’s corporate accounting and reporting practices and the quality and integrity of the\nCompany’s financial statements and reports; selects, hires, oversees and terminates the Company’s independent auditors;\nmonitors the Company’s independent auditors’ qualifications, independence and performance; monitors the Company and its\naffiliates’ compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and oversees all internal auditing functions and controls. The\nAudit Committee also oversees the risk management functions of the Bank.\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee which is available on the Company’s website at\nwww.unitedsecuritybank.com by clicking “About Us” and then “Governance.”\nAudit Committee Report\nThe Audit Committee report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference\nthis Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act (the “Acts”), and shall not\notherwise be deemed filed under the Acts.\nIn the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee considered and discussed the consolidated, audited-financial\nstatements with management and Moss Adams LLP with, and without, management present. The Audit Committee also\ndiscussed with Moss Adams LLP matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(PCAOB) “Auditing Standards No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees,” as currently in effect. The Audit Committee\ndiscussed with management and Moss Adams LLP the quality and adequacy of the internal controls of the Company. The\nAudit Committee received written disclosures and a letter from Moss Adams LLP, required by Independence Standards Board\nStandard No. 1, and has discussed with them their independent status. Moss Adams LLP did not perform any prohibited\nservices for the Company.\nBased on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company’s audited,\nconsolidated-financial statements be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023, for filing with the SEC.\nThe Audit Committee has also confirmed that there have been no new circumstances or developments since their respective\nappointments to the Audit Committee that would impair any member’s ability to act independently. Respectfully submitted by\nthe members of the Audit Committee:\nDated: March 26, 2024 Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares\nSusan Quigley, Chairperson\nKenneth Newby,\nTom Ellithorpe\nDirector Compensation\nDirector compensation is evaluated and recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board of\nDirectors. Non-employee directors receive cash and equity compensation for committee attendance and premiums for serving\nas chairpersons of certain committees. They may also receive equity grants in the form of stock options and awards.\nDirector compensation is paid in a 50/50 split of cash and stock awards. The monthly Board meeting fee is $1,610 per director.\nIn addition to the $1,610 monthly Board meeting fee, the Chairperson received an additional $345 per meeting and the Lead\nDirector received an additional $230 per meeting. Also, directors, other than Mr. Woods, were paid $230 for Executive\nCommittee meetings, $288 for Governance, ALCO, and 401(k) Committee meetings, and $403 for Audit, Compensation, IT,\nand Loan Committee meetings. The Chairpersons of the Audit, Compensation, Governance, and IT committees received $575\nper meeting and the Chairpersons of the 401(k) and Governance committees received $403 per meeting. The Lead Director,\nwho facilitates the Executive Session, received $345 per meeting. Director fees are calculated and paid based on an estimated\nnumber of Board and Committee meetings per year.\n12\nHistorically, the non-employee Company directors have received equity compensation in the form of nonqualified stock\noptions, restricted stock units, and stock awards. The Committee selected this form of equity compensation because it aligned\nthe interests of the Board of Directors to those of the shareholders and also because of accounting and tax treatments of such\nawards.\nThe following table shows compensation paid or accrued for the last fiscal year to the Company’s non-employee directors. Mr.\nWoods does not receive committee fees and his director meeting fees are disclosed in the “All Other Compensation” column in\nthe Summary Compensation Table for the Named Executive Officers. No stock awards to non-employee directors were\noutstanding at December 31, 2023.\nNON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE 2023\nNon-Equity Nonqualified\nFees Earned Stock Incentive Plan Deferred All Other\nor Paid in Awards ($) Option Compensation Compensation Compensation\nName Cash ($) (1) (2) (3) Awards ($) ($) Earnings ($) ($) Total ($)\nStanley Cavalla $ 12,032 $ 27,040 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 39,072\nTom Ellithorpe 25,476 40,484 — — — — 65,960\nJagroop “Jay” Gill 2,760 17,797 — — — — 20,557\nHeather Hammack 13,296 31,218 — — — — 44,514\nNabeel Mahmood 21,112 36,117 — — — — 57,229\nKenneth D.

Those directors who (i) retired\nas directors of the Bank prior to 2015 or (ii) retired as directors of Golden Oak Bank and Legacy Bank and who signed a\nshareholder’s agreement were eligible to participate in the Directors Emeritus Plan I. Directors Emerita under Directors\nEmeritus Plan I receive a monthly fee of $400, and receive preferential deposit and customer service with free checking as long\nas they serve as a Director Emeritus. Director Emeritus benefits terminate upon (i) the sale of a majority of the Director\nEmeritus’ shares of the Company’s common stock originally held, or (ii) the finding by the Company’s board of directors that\nthe Director Emeritus is engaging in activities or making statements which are detrimental to the Company or the Company’s\npublic image. At December 31, 2023, there were twelve (12) participants in the Directors Emeritus Plan. A total of $57,600\nwas paid under the Directors Emeritus Plan I in 2023.\nIn 2015, the Bank established the Directors Emeritus Plan II. The new plan resets monthly fees every five years for directors\nretiring during that five-year period. Directors retiring during 2015-2019 receive $600 per month for life and will receive\npreferential deposit and customer service with free checking as long as they serve as a Director Emeritus. Directors retiring\nbetween 2020-2024 will receive $700 per month. To qualify, the retiring director must have served as a director for at least five\nyears prior to retirement; and to continue receiving benefits the Director Emeritus must continue to own at least 25,000 shares\nof the Company’s common stock and not engage in activities or speech detrimental to the Company or the Bank. At\nDecember 31, 2023, there were five (5) participants in the Directors Emeritus Plan II. A total of $38,400 was paid under the\nDirectors Emeritus Plan II in 2023.\nBoth Director Emeritus Plans terminate if the Company is merged, acquired, or dissolved.\n13\nPROPOSAL 1:\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nNominees\nThe Company’s Bylaws provide that the number of directors of the Company shall not be less than eight (8) nor more than\nfifteen (15) until changed by an amendment of the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws adopted by the vote or written\nconsent of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, with the exact number of directors to be fixed from\ntime to time, within the range: (i) by a resolution duly adopted by the Board of Directors; or (ii) by the approval of the\nshareholders. The authorized number of directors was last fixed at ten (10).\nThe persons named below, all of whom are currently members of the Board of Directors, have been nominated for election as\ndirectors to serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are elected and have qualified. Each\nnominee has consented to being named in the Proxy Statement and has agreed to serve as a member of the Board of Directors,\nif elected. Votes will be cast in such a manner as to effect the election of all ten (10) nominees, as appropriate (or as many\nthereof as possible under the rules of cumulative voting). The ten (10) nominees for directors receiving the most votes will be\nelected directors. In the event that any of the nominees should be unable to serve as a director, it is intended that the proxy will\nbe voted for the election of such substitute nominee, if any, as shall be designated by the Board of Directors. The Board of\nDirectors has no reason to believe that any of the nominees named below will be unable to serve if elected.\nThe Board of Directors has determined that all of the current directors on the Board of Directors, except for two (2), are\n“independent,” as that term is defined in the listing standards and applicable rules of NASDAQ.

The Committee oversees the executive compensation program for our NEOs. The\nCommittee works with its independent consultant and management to examine the effectiveness of the Company’s executive\ncompensation program annually. Details of the Committee’s authority and responsibilities are specified in the Committee’s\ncharter, which may be accessed at our website, www.unitedsecuritybank.com.\nThe Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding the structure of incentive-based compensation plans and equity\nbased plans, both of which require Board approval. Operating within the plans approved by the Board, the Committee makes\nall final compensation and equity award decisions regarding our NEOs.\nRole of the CEO. The CEO provides recommendations to the Committee on compensation for NEOs other than himself. The\nCEO does not provide recommendations concerning his own compensation, nor is he present during discussions of the\nCommittee about his compensation.\nUse of Independent Consultants and Advisors. The Committee engaged the services of Pearl Meyer & Partners (Pearl Meyer)\nas its outside independent compensation consultant during 2022. Pearl Meyer advises the Compensation Committee on a range\nof executive and director compensation matters including plan design, competitive market assessments, trends, and best\npractices. Pearl Meyer does not provide any other services to the Company.\nThe Role of Benchmarking and Market Data. The companies comprising the comparator peer group are reviewed and selected\nby the Committee to ensure relevance, with data and recommendations provided to the Committee by Pearl Meyer. The\ncompanies comprising the 2023 peer group were selected based on the following considerations:\n• Size Characteristics: Assets, operating revenue, and market capitalization approximately two-thirds to twice the size\nof the Company;\n• Geography: Headquartered in California, Nevada, or Washington;\n18\n• Operations: Commercial banks with reasonably similar loan mix and ratio of non-interest income to operating revenue\nas the Company.\nThe 2023 peer group approved by the Committee consisted of the following companies:\nAmerican Riviera Bancorp Oak Valley Bancorp\nCalifornia BanCorp Plumas Bancorp\nCentral Valley Community Bancorp Provident Financial Holdings, Inc.\nFFB Bancorp Riverview Bancorp, Inc.\nCommunity West Bancshares Sound Financial Bancorp, Inc.\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. Summit State Bank\nFirst Northern Community Bancorp Timberland Bancorp, Inc.\nThe Committee engaged Pearl Meyer in 2022 to review the compensation of the NEOs and provide the Committee with an\nanalysis of competitive pay practices for senior executives at the peer-group companies listed above. The Committee\nestablished base salaries, variable cash incentive awards, and long-term, equity-based incentive awards on a case-by-case basis\nfor each NEO taking into account, among other things, individual and company performance, length of service, market data,\nadvancement potential, recruiting needs, internal equity, retention requirements, succession planning, and best compensation\ngovernance practices. While the Committee used the Pearl Meyer analysis to help inform its compensation decisions, it does\nnot target individual compensation levels to specific market pay percentiles.\n2023 Executive Compensation Program in Detail\nBase Salary\nBase salary represents annual fixed compensation and is a standard element of compensation necessary to attract and retain\nexecutive leadership talent. In making base salary decisions, the Committee considers the CEO’s feedback as it relates to NEO\nperformance, as well as each NEO’s position and level of responsibility within the Company. The Committee takes into\naccount factors such as relevant market data, individual performance and contributions, and length of service. The Committee\ninitially determined the appropriate annual base salary rate for each NEO as follows:\nNEO 2022 Base Salary 2023 Base Salary % Adjustment\nDennis R. Woods $596,720 $633,298 6.13%\nDavid A. Kinross (1) $275,000 $275,000 —%\nWilliam Yarbenet $251,253 $266,654 6.13%\n(1) Mr. Kinross’s base salary for 2023 was established when he began employment with the Bank in November of 2022.\nShort-term (Annual) Incentives\nAll of our NEOs are eligible to receive annual incentive awards, which are designed to focus executives on short-term financial\nand strategic goals that contribute to long-term value.\nThe NEOs are eligible to participate in the Annual Incentive Plan, which provides an opportunity to receive an annual incentive\naward that is contingent on achieving pre-defined annual corporate objectives, as well as individual goals.\nAnnual Incentive Plan. The 2023 Annual Incentive Plan provided our NEOs the opportunity to earn a performance-based\nannual cash incentive award. Actual bonus payouts depend on the achievement of pre-established performance objectives.\nMaximum annual incentive opportunities are expressed as a percentage of base salary, and were established by the Committee\nbased on the NEO’s level of responsibility and his ability to impact overall results. The 2023 maximum award opportunities for\nthe NEOs were as follows:\nMaximum Opportunity\nNEO as % of Base Salary\nDennis R. Woods 45%\nDavid A. Kinross 45%\nWilliam Yarbenet 45%\n19\nPerformance Metrics and Assigned Weights. At the beginning of each year, the Committee approves the corporate financial\nmeasures, goals and assigned weights for each NEO. For 2023 the Committee selected the following performance metrics:\n• Core Net Income Before Tax (CNIBT): Core net income is defined as pretax income less gain or loss on sales, OREO\nexpenses, provision for loan loss, bonus expense, and gain or loss on fair value of financial liability.\n• Deposit Growth: Deposit growth is defined as growth in average deposit balances over the prior year.\n• Non-performing Assets (NPA) Ratio: NPA is defined as total nonaccrual loans, accruing loans past due 90 days or\nmore, and other real estate owned as a percentage of total assets.\n• Regulatory Results: This metric is based on regulatory examination results.\nThe following table shows the performance measures and assigned weights for 2023:\nNEO CNIBT NPA Ratio Regulatory Results Deposit Growth\nDennis R. Woods 50% 15% 15% 20%\nDavid A. Kinross 50% 20% 20% 10%\nWilliam Yarbenet 50% 25% 15% 10%\nThe following table shows the performance requirements assigned for each measure and 2023 results:\nPerformance Measure Threshold Maximum Results\nCNIBT Growth —% 15% 12.7%\nNPA Ratio 1.55% 1.00% 1.36%\nRegulatory Results (1) -- -- --\nDeposit Growth (6.0)% 5.0% (12.7)%\n(1) Regulatory results cannot be publicly disclosed, but the outcome resulted in an earned payout.\nAnnual incentive awards are calculated based on actual performance as compared to the goals set forth. Performance below the\nthreshold requirement results in non-payment for the respective measure. The Committee has the discretion to reduce or\nincrease the payouts to the extent it determines appropriate to reflect the business environment and market conditions that may\naffect the Company’s financial and stock price performance. No such discretion was exercised by the Committee for payouts\nearned in 2023.\n2023 Annual Incentive Plan Results. Based on the corporate results and individual performance achievements described above,\nthe Committee approved the following Annual Incentive Plan incentive award payouts:\nEarned Payout as a\nNEO % of Base Salary Actual Payout ($)\nDennis R. Woods 31.5% $199,489\nDavid A. Kinross 29.4% 80,781\nWilliam Yarbenet 29.4% 78,330\nLong-Term Incentives\nUnder the 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan, the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted\nstock units.\nOn December 1, 2023, Mr. Kinross was granted a 87,610 restricted stock award (RSA) with a fair market value of $708,765\nand immediate vesting of 8,761 shares. The remaining RSAs vest over 9 years in the same amount on December 1 of each year\nwith final vesting on December 1, 2032.\nPay versus Performance\nDuring 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new rules requiring that the “pay versus performance”\ndisclosure codified in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 be provided by companies filing proxy and information statements regarding\nexecutive compensation. The rules require a disclosure of what is “actually paid” to the PEO (principal executive officer) and\n20\nNEOs (named executive officers) as well as total shareholder return for the company and its peers, net income, and a company-\nselected measure. Compensation “actually paid” has a specific formula which adds in the fair value of equity awards and\nreverses the annual change in total pension value included in the summary compensation table but adds in the service cost for\nthe pension.\nThe following table sets forth the pay versus performance information required by the new disclosure:\nValue of Initial Fixed $100\nInvestment Based on:\nAverage\nSummary Average Growth of\nSummary Compensation Compensation Peer Group Core Net\nCompensation Compensation Table Total Actually Paid Total Total Income before\nTable Total Actually Paid for Non-PEO to non-PEO Shareholder Shareholder Taxes (year\nYear for PEO (1) to PEO (4) NEOs (1) NEOs (4) Return (2) Return (2) Net Income over year) (3)\n2023 $ 941,187 $ 1,017,283 $ 521,233 $ 382,065 $ 121.33 $ 109.38 $ 19,796,000 12.70 %\n2022 586,627 782,117 405,295 412,037 114.87 140.75 15,686,000 61.30 %\n(1) For 2023, the PEO (Principal Executive Officer) is Dennis Woods, President & CEO of the Company.

For 2022, the PEO (Principal\nExecutive Officer) is Dennis Woods, President & CEO of the Company. The NEOs (Named Executive Officers) are William Yarbenet, the Company’s SVP &\nChief Credit Officer, and Robert Oberg, the Company’s SVP & Chief Risk Officer.\n(2) Total shareholder return represents the cumulative change in the value of a $100 investment based on the value of common stock as measured at December\n31, 2021, through and including the fiscal year-end for each reported period and dividend reinvestment during the period. Peer group includes the peers listed\npreviously in the CD&A.\n(3) Core net income before taxes is a non-GAAP financial number calculated by combing consolidated pretax earnings with incentive payments, OREO\nexpenses, provisions for loan loss, and gains/losses on equity securities, sale of assets, and fair value of junior subordinated debt.\n(4) The following table sets forth a reconciliation of summary compensation to compensation actually paid to the PEO and NEOs:\n2023 2022\nAverage of Average of\nPEO Other NEOs PEO Other NEOs\nAdjustments ($) ($) ($) ($)\nTotal Compensation from Summary Compensation Table $ 941,187 $ 521,233 $ 586,627 $ 405,295\nAdjustments for defined benefit pension plan:\n(Addition) subtraction: Aggregate change in actuarial\npresent value of accumulated benefit plan during year (23,436) 49,163 (206,593) 72,041\nAddition (subtraction): Service cost of pension during\nyear — — (7,503) 82,383\nAdjustment for stock awards:\nSubtraction: Summary Compensation Table amounts — 57,668 — —\nSubtraction: Fair value of equity awards granted during\nyear that are outstanding and unvested at year end — 60,699 — —\nSubtraction: Year-over-year change in fair value of\nawards granted in prior years for which vesting\nconditions were satisfied during the year 2,200 1,100 (1,800) $ (1,800) (1,800)\nSubtraction: Year-over-year change in fair value of\nawards granted in prior years that are outstanding and\nunvested at year end — 2,032 (1,800) (1,800)\nAddition: Fair value at end-of-year of awards granted\nand vested during the year 50,460 25,230 — —\nCompensation actually paid (as calculated) $ 1,017,283 $ 382,065 $ 782,117 $ 412,037\n21\nThe following tables set forth the weighting of performance objectives for incentive payout calculations:\n2023 Incentive Payments\nNon-\nGrowth of Core Performing\nNet Income Incentive Assets/Total Incentive Regulatory Incentive Incentive\nbefore Taxes Payout Assets Payout Issues Payout Deposit Growth Payout\n> 15% 45% < 1.0% 45% 0 45% > 5.0% 45%\n10 - 15% 40% 1 - 1.10% 40% 0 40% 2.5 - 5.0% 40%\n7.5 - 10% 35% 1.1 - 1.25% 35% 0 35% 0 - 2.5% 35%\n5 - 7.5% 30% 1.25 - 1.35% 30% 0 30% (1.5) - 0% 30%\n2.5 - 5% 25% 1.35 - 1.45% 25% 1 25% (3.0) - (1.5)% 25%\n1 - 2.5% 15% 1.45 - 1.55% 15% 1 15% (4.5) - (3.0)% 15%\n0 - 1% 5% 1.55% - 1.65% 5% 2 5% (6.0) - (4.5)% 5%\n< 0% — > 1.65% — 3+ — < (6.0)% —\n2022 Incentive Payments\nNon-\nGrowth of Core Performing\nNet Income Incentive Assets/Total Incentive Regulatory Incentive Incentive\nbefore Taxes Payout Assets Payout Issues Payout Deposit Growth Payout\n20+% 9.00% 0.80% 0-6% 0 5-15% 10% 0-10%\n15+% 7.00% 0.95% 0-4% 1-2 3-10% 8% 0-7%\n10+% 5.00% 1.10% 0-2% 2+ 1-5% 5% 0-4%\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nThe Company has established and sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan in order to appropriately incent key\nemployees, including the NEOs, to remain with the Company and become long-term loyal leaders. For more information on\nthe Company’s supplemental executive retirement plan and the benefits payable to the NEOs thereunder, please see “Narrative\nDisclosure Regarding Retirement Benefits and Change in Control Benefits - Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan” below.\nOther Benefits and Perquisites\nGroup insurance premiums, including, medical, disability, dental, and vision are paid for by the Company for NEOs and their\nfamilies. These benefits are common in the industry for similar positions. The Company pays these insurance benefits for all\nother employees, and employees may elect to pay for the cost of insurance for their families. The Company has also established\na contributory 401(k) defined contribution plan that allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their income to a trust\non a tax-favored basis. The Company matches participant contributions up to 4% of their eligible annual compensation. For\nmore information on the Company’s 401(k) plan, please see “Narrative Disclosure Regarding Retirement Benefits and Change\nin Control Benefits - 401(k) Plan,” below.\nThe Chief Executive Officer is provided with a Company-owned vehicle and given reimbursement for membership dues in a\ncountry club. The Chief Operating Officer and Chief Credit Officer are provided with Company-owned vehicles due to their\njob duties requiring extensive business travel. The Chief Financial Officer receives a monthly car allowance. See “All Other\nCompensation” in the Summary Compensation Table below. The Company provides these perquisites to certain of its NEOs\nbecause these perquisites are offered by many of its peers, and therefore, the Compensation Committee believes that providing\nthese perquisites to these NEOs is necessary for their retention and for the recruitment of new executive officers.\nEmployment Agreements and Executive Change in Control Agreements\nThe Bank has employment agreements in place with Messrs. Woods, Yarbenet, and Kinross. For more information on the\nemployment agreements and executive change in control agreements, please see “Narrative Disclosure Regarding Retirement\nBenefits and Change in Control Benefits” below.\n22\nOther Practices, Policies and Guidelines\nClawback Policy\nDuring 2023, the SEC adopted a final rule requiring that all publicly-held companies establish a formal, board-approved\n“clawback” policy. The policy must detail procedures providing for the recovery of incentive-based compensation erroneously\nreceived by current or former executive officers during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the year in\nwhich the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting\nrequirements. The rule requires that erroneous payments must be recovered even if there was no misconduct or failure of\noversight on the part an individual executive officer. The Company adopted a formal clawback policy on November 28, 2023.\nThe policy is included as an exhibit to our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur executive employment agreements contain a provision that, in the event of a material restatement of financial results, the\nBoard of Directors, based on available remedies, may seek recovery or forfeiture from any executive officer of the portion of\nincentive compensation that was received by, or vested in, the executive officer prior to the determination that a restatement\nwas required and that would not have been earned had performance been measured on the basis of the restated results where the\nBoard of Directors reasonably determines that the executive engaged in knowing or intentional fraudulent or illegal conduct that\nmaterially contributed to the need for the restatement.\nCompensation Risk Assessment\nIt is our belief that a material portion of our executives’ total compensation should be variable compensation, tied to the\nCompany’s financial performance. However, we strive to ensure that incentives do not result in actions that may conflict with\nthe long-term interests of the Company, our shareholders, or our customers. The Committee reviews an evaluation of all of our\nplans covered under the “Sound Incentive Compensation Policies” for attributes that could cause excessive risk-taking or\nunethical sales practices. We concluded that our programs and practices do not encourage excessive risk-taking nor do they\nencourage unethical sales practices which would potentially cause harm to the Company or our customers.\nInsider Trading Policies and Procedures\nThe Company has adopted an insider trading policy (the “Insider Trading Policy”) that applies to all (i) directors, (ii) executive\nofficers and (iii) employees who are exposed to insider information (together, the “Covered Persons”). The Insider Trading\nPolicy prohibits the use of material non-public information obtained by Covered Persons through their involvement with the\nCompany when making decisions to purchase, sell, give away, or otherwise trade in the Company’s securities or to provide\nsuch information to others outside the organization.

He vested immediately in 10%, or 8,761 shares, of a 87,610\nrestricted stock award granted on January 3, 2024.\nNarrative Disclosure Regarding Retirement Benefits and Change in Control Benefits\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has established a contributory 401(k) defined contribution plan (the “401(k) Plan”) covering all eligible\nemployees. The 401(k) Plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their income to a trust on a tax-favored basis.\nAll employees of the Company and/or the Bank are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan upon the first day of the month\nafter completing three months of service. Participants are automatically vested 100% in all participant contributions which may\nbe invested in any of several authorized investments. The Company also matches participant contributions up to 4% of their\neligible annual compensation. During 2023, the Company reserved $282,000 to match all employee contributions to the 401(k)\nPlan, of which $39,000 was reserved to match contributions of the Company’s Named Executive Officers and is included as\n“All Other Compensation” in the Summary Compensation Table above.\n25\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nAs part of its incentives, the Company established and sponsored a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) pursuant to\nwhich the Company agreed to provide supplemental retirement income to key employees, including certain NEOs and their\nfamilies, if certain agreed upon eligibility and vesting conditions were met. The primary condition to the vesting of benefits\nunder the Company’s SERP was long-term service to the Company. Therefore, vesting was set pro-rata for each year over the\nterm of the SERP. Prior service credit for any newly hired executive was not permitted, except at the discretion of the\nCompensation Committee, which oversees the management of the SERP. While the expected annual payment under the SERP\nwas limited to not more than 50% of the annual base salary of the executive officer at the commencement of the SERP, the\nCompensation Committee may increase the annual payment amount of the SERP to 50% of the annual base salary averaged\nover the last five years of the executive officer’s employment with the Company. The Compensation Committee may also\napprove a split-dollar agreement related to the SERP of an executive officer, and determine the terms of such split-dollar\nagreement including the treatment of imputed income of such split-dollar agreement to the executive officer and any gross up of\ntaxes associated with the imputed income. The Company will no longer enter into SERP agreements with employees.\nDennis R. Woods, the Company’s President and CEO, commenced participation in the Company’s SERP in June 1996, and by\nJune 2007, all benefits under his SERP were fully vested and could be drawn upon by Mr. Woods upon his retirement. Under\nthe terms of his SERP, Mr. Woods will be entitled to compensation for 15 years at $100,000 per year.\nWilliam Yarbenet, the Company’s Chief Credit Officer, commenced participation in the Company’s SERP in August 2015.\nMr. Yarbenet will be fully vested in August 2025 and will be entitled to compensation of $60,500 per year for life.\nThe SERP also provided that benefits be paid to the executive officers’ beneficiaries in the event of their deaths. The\nCompany’s obligation to pay begins in the month following death. The Company purchased single-premium life insurance\npolicies for each SERP issued to protect the Company for this eventuality. The life insurance policies accrue tax-free income to\nthe Company. The policies can remain in effect until the executive is deceased, even after all benefits under the SERP have\nbeen paid or can be liquidated at the option of the Company at the cash surrender value. The death benefit is designed to return\nto the Company the cost of the SERP expense. The cash value of the insurance is carried on its books as an asset.\nIn recent years, the Company has not offered such plans to new executive officers; therefore, Mr. Kinross is not a participant.\nThe following table provides certain information regarding the retirement benefits for the NEOs.\nPension Benefits\nNumber of Years Present Value of Payments During\nCredited Service Accumulated Last Fiscal Year\nNEO Plan Name (#) Benefit ($) (1) ($)\nDennis R.

Woods for his service as President\nand Chief Executive Officer with an annual base salary of $499,392. The term of the employment agreement originally\nterminated on December 31, 2017, but, subject to early termination, renews annually for successive three-year terms unless\nprior notice of non-renewal is given by either party on an annual basis. Accordingly, Mr. Woods’ employment agreement now\nterminates on December 31, 2024. The Board of Directors may from time to time review Mr. Woods’ base salary and, at its\nsole discretion, may increase the base salary. Mr. Woods may also receive discretionary bonuses, if any, as determined by the\nBoard of Directors and is eligible to earn incentive bonuses pursuant to any programs developed and implemented. The\nemployment agreement provides that, in the event of involuntary termination without cause or voluntary termination for “Good\nCause” (as defined), Mr. Woods would continue to receive his then current base salary for 24 months after such event, plus\ncontinuation of his group medical insurance benefits or payment of COBRA continuation benefits for 24 months; provided,\nhowever, if Mr. Woods is terminated within one year following a change in control (as defined), he would be entitled to receive\na lump sum payment equal to 36 months’ then current base salary plus continuation of group medical insurance benefits or\npayment of COBRA continuation benefits for 36 months. Payments made in connection with a change in control would be\nreduced, if necessary, to ensure that no payments constitute an excess parachute payment under Internal Revenue Code Section\n280G.\n26\nOn April 28, 2015, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. William M. Yarbenet for his service as\nSenior Vice President and Chief Credit Officer with an annual base salary of $210,272. The term of the employment agreement\noriginally terminated on December 31, 2017 but, subject to early termination, renews annually for successive two-year terms\nunless prior notice of non-renewal is given by either party on an annual basis. Accordingly, Mr. Yarbenet’s employment\nagreement now terminates on December 31, 2025. The Board of Directors may from time to time review Mr. Yarbenet’s base\nsalary and, at its sole discretion, may increase the base salary. Mr. Yarbenet may also receive discretionary bonuses, if any, as\ndetermined by the Board of Directors and is eligible to earn incentive bonuses pursuant to any programs developed and\nimplemented. The employment agreement provides that, in the event of involuntary termination without cause or voluntary\ntermination for “Good Cause” (as defined), Mr. Yarbenet would continue to receive his then current base salary for 12 months\nafter such event plus continuation of his group medical insurance benefits or payment of COBRA continuation benefits for 12\nmonths; provided, however, if Mr. Yarbenet is terminated within one year following a change in control (as defined), he would\nbe entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 24 months’ then current base salary plus continuation of group medical\ninsurance benefits or payment of COBRA continuation benefits for 24 months. Payments made in connection with a change in\ncontrol would be reduced, if necessary, to ensure that no payments constitute an excess parachute payment under Internal\nRevenue Code Section 280G.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. David A. Kinross for his service as\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer with an annual base salary of $275,000. The term of the employment\nagreement originally terminates on December 31, 2024 but, subject to early termination, renews annually for successive two-\nyear terms unless prior notice of non-renewal is given by either party on an annual basis. The Board of Directors may from\ntime to time review Mr. Kinross’ base salary and, in its sole discretion, may increase the base salary. Mr. Kinross may also\nreceive discretionary bonuses, if any, as determined by the Board of Directors and is eligible to earn incentive bonuses pursuant\nto any programs developed and implemented. The employment agreement provides that, in the event of involuntary\ntermination without cause or voluntary termination for “Good Cause” (as defined), Mr. Kinross would continue to receive his\nthen current base salary for 12 months after such event plus continuation of his group medical insurance benefits or payment of\nCOBRA continuation benefits for 12 months; provided, however, if Mr. Kinross is terminated within one year following a\nchange in control (as defined), he would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to 24 months’ then current base salary\nplus continuation of group medical insurance benefits or payment of COBRA continuation benefits for 24 months. Payments\nmade in connection with a change in control would be reduced, if necessary, to ensure that no payments constitute an excess\nparachute payment under Internal Revenue Code Section 280G.\nCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\nDuring 2023, there were no existing or proposed, material transactions between the Company and its executive officers,\ndirectors, or principal shareholders (beneficial owners of 5% or more of the Company’s Common Stock), or the immediate\nfamily or associates of any of the foregoing persons, except as indicated below.\nSome of the Company’s directors and executive officers, as well as the companies with which such directors and executive\nofficers are associated, are customers of, and have had banking transactions with the Bank in the ordinary course of its business,\nand the Bank expects to have such ordinary banking transactions with such persons in the future. During the normal course of\nbusiness, the Bank enters into loans with related parties, including executive officers and directors. These loans are made with\nsubstantially the same terms, including rates, collateral and repayment terms, as those prevailing at the same time with unrelated\nparties, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or represent other unfavorable features. See “Note 3 -\nLoans” in the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report for detail on outstanding loans and\ncommitments to related parties. The Company may also engage in banking (non-lending) transactions with corporations of\nwhich the Company’s directors or officers may own a controlling interest, or also serve as directors or officers. These\ntransactions are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest and collateral, as\nthose prevailing for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Company, do not involve more than the normal risk\nof collectability or present other unfavorable features, and comply with the provisions of applicable federal and state law.\nDuring 2022, the Company entered into a consulting services agreement with Mr. Mahmood whereby he was engaged as an\nOutsourced Chief Information Officer for a portion of the year. In connection with the engagement, the Company paid Mr.\nMahmood fees for consulting services of $200,000 and reimbursed him for certain out-of-pocket travel related expenses. As a\nresult of the consulting agreement with Mr. Mahmood, he will be considered a non-independent director for three years.\n27\nPROPOSAL 2:\nRATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING\nFIRM\nThe firm of Moss Adams LLP, independent auditors, has been selected to serve as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm for 2024. Shareholders are hereby asked to ratify the selection of Moss Adams LLP. It is anticipated that a\nrepresentative of Moss Adams LLP will be present at the Meeting, will be able to make a statement, if desired, and will be\navailable to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.\nAlthough ratification is not required by our Bylaws or the SEC, the Board is submitting the selection of Moss Adams LLP to\nour shareholders for ratification because we value our shareholders’ views on the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm and as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event that our shareholders fail to ratify the selection of Moss\nAdams LLP, however, we reserve the right to retain Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for\n2024. Even if the selection is ratified, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered\npublic accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the\nCompany and its shareholders.\nDuring the two most recent fiscal years there were no disagreements between the Company and its principal accountant on any\nmatter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which\ndisagreements, if not resolved to the principal accountant’s satisfaction, would have caused the principal accountant to make\nreference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports. The audit reports on the consolidated\nfinancial statements of the Company as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 were issued by Moss Adams LLP\nand did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit\nscope, or accounting principles.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, the Company’s Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services\nperformed by the independent registered public accountants in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors’\nindependence. The SEC’s rules specify the types of non-audit services that the independent registered public accountants may\nnot provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committee’s responsibility for administration of the engagement of the\nindependent registered public accountants.\nConsistent with SEC’s rules, the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit\nservices and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accountants to the Company or any of\nits subsidiaries. The Audit Committee approved 100% of all professional services rendered by Moss Adams LLP during the\n2023 and 2022 fiscal years, including pre-approval of all audit and tax services, and considered whether the provision of such\nservices is compatible with Moss Adams LLP maintaining its independence. The Audit Committee determined that the\nprovision of non-audit services to the Company by Moss Adams LLP was compatible with maintaining the independence of\nMoss Adams LLP.\nAggregate fees billed by Moss Adams LLP to the Company during 2023 and 2022, respectively, are as follows:\n2023 2022\nAudit Fees (1) $ 673,796 $ 354,933\nAudit-Related Fees (2) 26,000 26,250\nTax Fees (3) 32,580 31,275\nTotal Fees $ 732,376 $ 412,458\n(1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements, quarterly\nreview of financial statements, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings.\n(2) Audit-related fees represent fees for professional services such as the audit of the Company’s employee benefit plan, consent related\nprocedures, and technical accounting, consulting, and research.\n(3) Tax fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with tax compliance and preparation relating to tax return and tax audits, as\nwell as for tax consulting and planning services.\nRatification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for\n2024 requires the affirmative vote of: (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock represented in\nperson or by proxy and voting at the Meeting; and (ii) a majority of the shares required for a quorum. Unless otherwise directed\nor specified, shares represented by proxy will be voted “FOR” Proposal 2.\n28\nRecommendation:\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” RATIFICATION\nOF THE SELECTION OF MOSS ADAMS LLP TO SERVE AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC\nACCOUNTING FIRM OF UNITED SECURITY BANCSHARES FOR 2024.\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORT\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company’s directors and certain executive officers and persons who own more\nthan ten percent (10%) of a registered class of the Company’s equity securities (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”), to file\nreports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. The Reporting Persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish\nthe Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.\nBased solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from the Reporting Persons that\nno Forms 4 or 5 were required for those persons, the Company believes that during 2023 the Reporting Persons complied with\nall filing requirements applicable to them, except for Dennis Woods and Robert Oberg, who each filed one late Form 4.\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\nProposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, must be received by the\nCompany at its principal executive offices by December 9, 2024, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement and form of proxy\nrelating to that meeting and must comply with the applicable requirements of federal securities laws, including Rule 14a-8\nunder the Exchange Act. As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion.\nProxies solicited by the Board of Directors for the 2025 Annual Meeting will confer discretionary authority to vote on any\nmatter to come before the Annual Meeting with respect to which the Company does not receive notice of the matter by\nFebruary 21, 2025.\nOTHER MATTERS\nManagement does not presently know of any matters to be presented at the Meeting other than those set forth above. If other\nmatters come before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy card to vote the proxy in\naccordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on such matters.\nUnited Security Bancshares\nDated: April 3, 2024 Susan Quigley, Secretary\nIt is very important that every shareholder vote.

The common stock of United Security Bancshares is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “UBFO.”\nUnited Security Bank was chartered under the laws of the State of California in 1987 as a commercial bank. On June 12, 2001,\nUnited Security Bank reorganized into the bank holding company form of ownership and thereby became the wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of United Security Bancshares and each share of United Security Bank stock was exchanged for a share of United\nSecurity Bancshares stock on a one-for-one basis. The principal business of United Security Bancshares is to serve as the\nholding company for United Security Bank.\nReferences to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties.\nReferences to “we,” “us,” or the “Company” refer to United Security Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a\nconsolidated basis. References to the “Holding Company,” refer to United Security Bancshares, the parent company, on a\nstand-alone basis.\nUnited Security Bank\nThe Bank is a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Fresno, California. At December 31, 2023, the Bank operates\nthree branches (including its main office), one construction lending office, and one commercial lending office in Fresno,\nCalifornia and one branch each in Oakhurst, Caruthers, San Joaquin, Firebaugh, Coalinga, Bakersfield, Taft, Campbell, and\nMendota California. The Bank has Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs) at all branch locations and nine off-site ITMs at non-\nbranch locations. In addition, the Holding Company and the Bank have administrative headquarters located at 2126 Inyo\nStreet, Fresno, California, 93721.\nYork Monterey Properties, Inc.\nYork Monterey Properties, Inc. (YMP) was incorporated in California on April 17, 2019, for the purpose of holding specific\nparcels of real estate acquired by the Bank through, or in lieu of, foreclosures in Monterey County. These properties exceeded\nthe 10-year regulatory holding period for other real estate owned, or “OREO.” YMP was funded with a $250,000 cash\ninvestment and the transfer of those parcels by the Bank to YMP. In December 2021, $805,000 in additional funding was\ntransferred to YMP to fund estimated expenses over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2023, these properties are included\nwithin the consolidated balance sheets as part of “other real estate owned.”\nUSB Capital Trust II\nDuring July 2007, the Company formed USB Capital Trust II as a wholly-owned special purpose entity for the purpose of\nissuing Trust Preferred Securities. USB Capital Trust II is a Variable Interest Entity and a deconsolidated entity pursuant to\ncurrent accounting standards related to variable interest entities. On July 23, 2007, USB Capital Trust II issued $15 million in\nTrust Preferred Securities. These securities have a thirty-year maturity and bear a floating rate of interest (repricing quarterly)\nof 1.29% over the forward 3-month SOFR rate. Interest is payable quarterly.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities, USB Capital Trust II used the proceeds of the Trust Preferred\nSecurities offering to purchase a like amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company pays\ninterest on the junior subordinated debentures to USB Capital Trust II, which represents the sole source of dividend\ndistributions to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities. During 2015, $3.0 million of the $15.0 million principal balance\nof the subordinated debentures related to the Trust Preferred Securities was purchased by the Bank and subsequently purchased\nby the Company from the Bank. The Company redeemed the $3.0 million in par value of the subordinated debentures,\nresulting in a remaining contractual principal balance of $12.0 million since year-end 2015. The Company may redeem the\njunior subordinated debentures at any time at par.\nThe following discussion of services should be read in conjunction with “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n5\nTable of Contents\nBank Services\nThe Bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and\nindividuals located in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties, including a variety of deposit instruments including\npersonal and business checking accounts and savings accounts, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW)\naccounts, money market accounts, and time certificates of deposit. Most deposits are comprised of accounts from individuals\nand from small- and medium-sized, business-related sources.\nThe Bank also offers a full complement of lending products, including real estate loans, real estate construction loans,\ncommercial and industrial loans, agricultural loans, and installment loans.\nReal estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property. The repayment of real estate\nmortgage loans generally is from the cash flow of the borrower. Commercial and industrial loans are diversified by industry.\nLoans may be originated in the Bank’s market area, purchased, or participated with other financial institutions outside the\nmarket area. A substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases, or\nother collateral. The remainder are unsecured. However, extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the\nborrower to repay. Repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. Real estate construction\nloans consist of loans to residential and commercial contractors, which are secured by single-family residential or multi-family\nproperties. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. The repayment of real estate construction loans is\ngenerally from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions. Agricultural loans are generally secured by land,\nequipment, inventory, and receivables. Repayment of agricultural loans is generally from the expected cash flow of the\nborrower.\nWhile the Bank has a high concentration of commercial real estate loans, it is not in the business of making residential\nmortgage loans to individuals. The residential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of purchased fixed-rate 30-year\nresidential mortgage pools. The Bank does not originate, or have in the loan portfolio, any subprime, Alt-A, or option\nadjustable-rate loans. The Bank does originate interest-only loans which are generally revolving lines of credit to commercial\nand agricultural businesses or for real estate development where the borrowers business may be seasonal or cash flows may be\nrestricted until the completion of the project.\nLoan participations are purchased from and sold to other financial institutions. The underwriting standards for loan\nparticipations and purchases are the same as non-participated loans, and are subject to the same limitations, collateral\nrequirements, and borrower requirements.\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes various loan commitments, including granting customers collateralized and\nuncollateralized lines of credit, and incurs certain contingent liabilities. Due to the nature of the business of the Bank’s\ncustomers, there is no absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments, including collateralized and\nuncollateralized lines of credit, and, therefore, it is not possible to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be\nexercised within the current year. While no assurance can be provided, it is not believed that any such utilization will constitute\na material liquidity demand.\nIn addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above, the Bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed\nto attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders. These services include online banking, mobile\nbanking, safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, ITM services, payroll direct deposit, cashier’s checks, and cash management\nservices. While the Bank does not operate a trust department, arrangements with correspondent banks for trust services can be\nrequested.\n6\nTable of Contents\nCompetition and Market Share\nThe banking business in California as well as the Bank’s market area is highly competitive with respect to both loans and\ndeposits. The Bank competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, money\nmarket funds, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Bank competes for loans and deposits by offering competitive\ninterest rates and by seeking to provide a higher level of personalized service than is generally offered by larger competitors.\nRegulatory restrictions on interstate bank branching and acquisitions and on the provision of certain financial services, such as\nsecurities underwriting and insurance, have been reduced or eliminated. The availability of online and mobile banking services\ncontinues to expand. Changes in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry cannot be predicted; however,\npast legislation has served to intensify the competitive environment. Many of the major commercial banks operating in the\nBank’s market areas offer certain services, such as trust and wealth management services, which the Bank does not offer\ndirectly. In addition, banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers.\nThe Bank’s primary market areas are Fresno, Madera, Santa Clara, and Kern County, California. There are 58 FDIC-insured\nfinancial institutions competing for business in those areas. The following table sets forth information regarding deposit market\nshare and ranking by county as of June 30, 2023, which is the most current information available.\nRank Share\nFresno County 9th 4.24%\nMadera County 4th 8.40%\nKern County 14th 0.68%\nSanta Clara County 40th 0.01%\nTotal of Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties 20th 0.33%\nSupervision and Regulation\nBanking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Federal and state laws and the regulations of the federal and state bank\nregulatory agencies govern most aspects of a bank’s business, including capital adequacy ratios, reserves against deposits,\nlimitations on the nature and amount of loans which may be made, the location of branch offices, borrowings, and dividends.\nThe primary goals of banking laws and regulations are to maintain a safe and sound banking system, to protect depositors and\nthe FDIC’s insurance fund, and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of these goals, Congress and\nthe States have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks, bank\nholding companies, and the financial services industry. Consequently, the growth and earnings performance of the Company\nand the Bank can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements\nof applicable state and federal statutes, regulations, and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including:\n• The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC,\n• The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, or DFPI,\n• The Federal Reserve Board, or FRB.\nChanges in applicable law or regulations, and in their application by the regulatory agencies, whether as the result of changes in\nthe political climate or otherwise, cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on the business, operations, and financial\nresults of the Company or the Bank.\nDescribed below are elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the Company and/or the Bank. The descriptions\nare not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations\ndescribed.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”),which was enacted in 2010,\nsignificantly revised and expanded the rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory\nagencies. The numerous rules and regulations being promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are impacting banks’\noperations and compliance costs. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include:\n• revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in deposit insurance\ncoverage to $250,000;\n7\nTable of Contents\n• reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions;\n• interest payments on business checking accounts;\n• the removal of barriers to interstate branching;\n• and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.\nOther provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include:\n• Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act: increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of\nrisk-weighted assets; created a new category and required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio for “common equity\nTier 1” as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity; established a minimum non-risk-based leverage\nratio set at 4.00%, eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks; changed the permitted composition of\nTier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities (unless issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company\nwith less than $15 billion in assets), mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and included\nunrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities; added an additional capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios, which must be met to\navoid limitations on the ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses; changed the risk\nweights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios for high volatility commercial real\nestate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain\nmortgage-backed and other securities exposures.\n• Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are\nnow based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The\nDodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% of\ninsured deposits and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions\nwhen the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.\n• Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules\nprohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with\nassets in excess of $1.0 billion.\n• Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states\nto the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch.\n• Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent federal agency called the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been granted broad rulemaking, supervisory, and\nenforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit\nOpportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair\nDebt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the GLBA, and certain other statutes.\nThe CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10\nbillion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are still examined\nand supervised by their federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to\nprevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The\nDodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential\nmortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows\nborrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as\ndefined by the CFPB. The Dodd- Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that\nare more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys\ngeneral to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.\n• Final Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implemented\na part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” The final rules were amended in\nOctober 2019. Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities, including the Bank, are\nrestricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in\ncertain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered “covered funds.” Banks that do not\nhave significant trading activities, such as the Bank, will be assumed to operate under a presumption of\ncompliance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also resulted in the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil to oversee and coordinate the efforts of the primary U.S financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to\naddress financial stability matters.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted under the administration of former President Barack Obama. The subsequent administration\nunder President Donald Trump sought to roll-back key pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act in an effort to loosen regulatory\nrestrictions on financial institutions including, but not limited to, easing the “Volker Rule,” stress tests, and other constraints on\n8\nTable of Contents\nfinancial institutions. The Biden administration has expressed a commitment to reemphasize restrictions on financial\ninstitutions which were loosened during the previous administration. The Company cannot predict which provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act will be repealed, put in to effect, delayed, or enforced and, therefore, cannot predict the effect, if any, that the\nDodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder or actions initiated by the Biden administration will have on its future\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\nGeneral\nThe Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is\nregistered with, and regulated and examined by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB. The Company\nis subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”). In addition, as the Company lists its common stock on Nasdaq, it is subject to the listing standards and rules\nof Nasdaq.\nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified existing FRB policy requiring the Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank,\nand to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. However, because the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) provides for functional regulation of financial holding company activities by various\nregulators, the GLBA prohibits the FRB from requiring payment by a holding company to a depository institution if the\nfunctional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment. In those cases, the FRB could instead require the\ndivestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. As a result of the Dodd-Frank\nAct, non-bank subsidiaries of a holding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must\nbe examined and regulated in a manner that are at least as stringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository\ninstitution of the holding company.\nBank Holding Company Liquidity\nAs a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, the Company must rely on its own resources to pay its operating expenses\nand dividends to its shareholders. In addition to raising capital on its own behalf or borrowing from external sources, the\nCompany may also obtain funds from dividends paid by, and fees charged for services provided to, the Bank. However,\nstatutory and regulatory constraints on the Bank may restrict or totally preclude the payment of dividends by the Bank to the\nCompany.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nThe Company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the Bank within the meaning of\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and the FRB’s Regulation W. Under Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation\nW, loans by the Bank to affiliates, investments by them in affiliates’ stock, and taking affiliates’ stock as collateral for loans to\nany borrower is limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital, in the case of any one affiliate, and is limited to 20% of the Bank’s\ncapital, in the case of all affiliates. In addition, transactions between the Bank and any affiliates must be on terms and\nconditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the\nBank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliates. In particular, a bank and its\nsubsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low-quality asset, as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. These\nrestrictions also prevent a bank holding company and a bank subsidiary’s other affiliates from borrowing from the bank\nsubsidiary unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts.\nThe Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and\ndistribution of securities.\nThe Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank or\nbank holding company’s executive officers, directors and principal shareholders; any company controlled by any such\nexecutive officer, director or shareholder; or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director\nor principal shareholder. Additionally, such loans or extensions of credit must comply with loan-to-one-borrower limits;\nrequire prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts; must be made on\nsubstantially the same and follow credit-underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for\n9\nTable of Contents\ncomparable transactions with non-insiders; must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment, or present other\nunfavorable features; and must not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus in the aggregate.\nLimitations on Business and Investment Activities\nUnder the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain the FRB’s approval before: (i) directly or indirectly acquiring more\nthan 5% ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company; (ii) acquiring all or substantially\nall of the assets of another bank; (iii) or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company.\nThe FRB may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States without regard to\nwhether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located. In approving interstate\nacquisitions however, the FRB must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be\nheld by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is\nlocated, provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies,\nand state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years,\nbefore being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company.\nIn addition to owning or managing banks, bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the\nFRB has determined to be “so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Holding Company, therefore,\nis permitted to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses.\nAdditionally, qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the FRB may engage in a full range of\nfinancial activities, including insurance, securities, and merchant banking. The Company has not elected to qualify for these\nfinancial services.\nFederal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in\nconnection with the extension of credit. Thus, for example, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish\nany services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that:\n• the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the Bank other than a loan,\ndiscount, deposit or trust services;\n• the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or service from or to the Company or any\nsubsidiaries; or\n• the customer must not obtain some other credit, property, or services from competitors, except reasonable\nrequirements to assure soundness of credit extended.\nCapital Adequacy\nBank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines. If\ncapital falls below minimum guideline levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire\nor establish additional banks or non-bank businesses.\nThe FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, discussed in more detail below in the section entitled “The Bank - Capital\nStandards,” assign various risk percentages or weights to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage\nof risk-weighted assets. Under the terms of the guidelines, bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy\nguidelines based both on total risk-weighted assets and on total assets, without regard to risk weights.\nThe risk-based guidelines are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular\ncircumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations. For example, the FRB’s capital guidelines contemplate that\nadditional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by\nconcentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Moreover, any banking organization\nexperiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities, particularly under the expanded powers under\nthe GLBA, would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.\nLimitations on Dividend Payments\nAs applicable to the Company, California Corporations Code Section 500 provides that neither the Company nor any of its\nsubsidiaries shall make a distribution to the Company’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith\nthat either:\n10\nTable of Contents\n• The amount of retained earnings of the Company immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of\n(A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or\n• Immediately after the distribution, the value of the Company’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total\nliabilities plus the preferential rights amount.\nAdditionally, the FRB’s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends\nexceeding its net income for the past year or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s\nfinancial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their\nnon-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable\nstatutes and regulations.\nSecurities Registration and Listing\nThe Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act and, as a result, is subject to the information,\nproxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other disclosure requirements and restrictions of the Exchange\nAct, as well as the Securities Act, both administered by the SEC. The Company is required to file annual, quarterly and other\ncurrent reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site, http://www.sec.gov, where SEC filings may be accessed.\nThe SEC filings are also available on the Bank’s website at http://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/Docs.\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on Nasdaq and trades under the symbol “UBFO.” The Company is subject to Nasdaq\nstandards for listed companies. Nasdaq has adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and\ninvestors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors.\nThe Bank\nGeneral\nAs a California state-chartered bank and a member of the FRB, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular\nexamination by the FRB and the DFPI. The Bank is subject to California laws insofar as they are not preempted by federal\nbanking law. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits in an amount up to $250,000 per\ncustomer and, as such, the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the regulations\nof the FDIC. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in California and the United\nStates, the Bank’s business is particularly susceptible to changes in California and federal legislation and regulation, which may\nhave the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.\nCapital Standards\nFederal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to maintain adequate capital based on the\nsize, asset composition, and complexity of the institution. Generally, FDIC-insured depository institutions must maintain\nseveral minimum capital ratios: a common equity tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a tier 1 capital to risk-based assets\nratio; a total capital to risk-based assets; and a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These ratios involve complex\ncalculations of various categories of capital and various categories of assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can\ninitiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the institution’s financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2020, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in May\n2018, the Federal regulatory agencies adopted simplified capital requirements for certain qualifying “community” banking\norganizations. Depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total\nconsolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to tier 1 capital divided by average total\nconsolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, are eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework. Qualifying\ncommunity banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage\nratio of greater than 9 percent are considered to have satisfied the applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the\nagencies’ capital rules and are considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements. Institutions that cease meeting\nthe qualifying criteria have two calendar quarters within which to re-qualify, so long as the institution maintains a leverage ratio\nof greater than 8 percent during the grace period.\nThe Company and the Bank met the criteria and adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework during 2020.\n11\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank were “well capitalized” under the applicable standards. The actual\ncapitalization ratios for the Bank and the Company as of December 31, 2023 can be found at “Note 21 - Regulatory Matters” to\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt\ncorrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one\nor more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to FDICIA, the FRB promulgated regulations defining the following five\ncategories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios:\nUnder the regulations, a bank shall be deemed to be:\n• “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8%\nor more, has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5% or more,\nand is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;\n• “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%\nor more and a leverage capital ratio of 4% or more (3% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the\ndefinition of “well capitalized”;\n• “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is\nless than 4%, or a leverage capital ratio that is less than 4% (3% under certain circumstances);\n• “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio that is less than 3% or a leverage capital ratio that is less than 3%; and\n• “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.\nA bank’s category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital\ncategory may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\nWhile these benchmarks have not changed, due to market turbulence, the regulators have strongly encouraged and, in many\ninstances, required, banks and bank holding companies to achieve and maintain higher ratios as a matter of safety and\nsoundness.\nBanks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if, after making the payment,\nthe bank would be “undercapitalized,” that is, the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital\nmeasure. Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to “undercapitalized” banks. Banks classified as “undercapitalized”\nare required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company, if any. Broad regulatory authority was\ngranted with respect to “significantly undercapitalized” banks, including forced mergers, growth restrictions, ordering new\nelections for directors, forcing divestiture by its holding company, if any, requiring management changes, and prohibiting the\npayment of bonuses to senior management. Even more severe restrictions are applicable to “critically undercapitalized” banks.\nRestrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator. All of the federal banking agencies have\npromulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action.\nA bank, based upon its capital levels, that is classified as “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may\nbe treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and\nopportunity for a hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such\ntreatment. Further, a bank that otherwise meets the capital levels to be categorized as “well capitalized,” will be deemed to be\n“adequately capitalized,” if the bank is subject to a written agreement requiring that the bank maintain specific capital levels.\nAt each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions. The federal banking agencies,\nhowever, may not treat an institution as “critically undercapitalized” unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment.\nBanking organizations that meet the criteria and have adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework, such as the\nCompany and the Bank, are deemed to be “well capitalized” for “prompt corrective action” purposes.\nIn addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations, such as the\nBank, may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices\nin conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or\nany written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver, the\nissuance of a cease-and-desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance for deposits (in the case of a\n12\nTable of Contents\ndepository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of\nformal and informal agreements, and the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution-affiliated parties.\nBrokered Deposit Restrictions\nWell-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is\nable to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the\nrate paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered\ndeposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank was deemed to be “well-capitalized” and, therefore, eligible to accept brokered\ndeposits.\nLimitations on Dividend Payments\nCalifornia law restricts the amount available for cash dividends the Bank may pay to the Company. Under California law,\nfunds available for cash dividend payments by a bank are restricted to the lesser of: (1) retained earnings; or (2) the bank’s net\nincome for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). Cash dividends may also\nbe paid out of the greater of: (i) net income for a bank’s last preceding fiscal year; (ii) a bank’s retained earnings; or (iii) net\nincome for a bank’s current fiscal year, upon the prior approval of the DFPI. If the DFPI finds that the stockholders’ equity of a\nbank is not adequate or that the payment of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound for the bank, the DFPI may order the bank\nnot to pay any dividends.\nPremiums for Deposit Insurance\nThe FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per qualified account. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system to set\nquarterly insurance premium assessments which categorizes banks into four risk categories based on capital levels and\nsupervisory “CAMELS” ratings and names them Risk Categories I, II, III and IV. The CAMELS rating system is based upon\nan evaluation of the six critical elements of an institution’s operations: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management, Earnings,\nLiquidity, and Sensitivity to risk. This rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and\noperational factors financial institution examiners assess in their evaluation of an institution’s performance.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act required the FDIC to maintain a reserve ratio of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund at not\nless than 1.35% of insured deposits and to adopt a restoration plan to achieve the statutory minimum within 8 years if the ratio\nfalls below 1.35%. During 2020 the reserve ratio fell below 1.35% to 1.30% due to extraordinary growth in insured deposits\nand, accordingly, in September 2020, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan providing for FDIC monitoring deposit balance\ntrends, potential losses, and other factors that affect the reserve ratio, while maintaining the current schedule of assessment rates\nfor all insured institutions. Under the restoration plan, the FDIC is to provide updates at least semi-annually. In setting the\nassessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total\nconsolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less average\ntangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits. The semi-annual update as of March 31,\n2022, showed a decline of four basis points to 1.23%. As a result, on October 20, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amendment to the\nrestoration plan resulting in a uniform increase in the base deposit insurance assessment of two basis points beginning with the\nfirst quarter of 2023 in order to meet the requirement of 1.35% by September 30, 2028. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC\nadopted a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund associated with\nprotecting uninsured depositors following the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Under the final rule, the\nassessment base for an insured depository institution will be equal to the institution’s estimated uninsured deposits as of\nDecember 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits.\nThe FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the\ninstitution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has\nviolated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. The\ntermination of deposit insurance would result in the forced closure of the Bank which would have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSafety and Soundness Standards\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and\naddressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and\nmanagerial standards relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation;\n(iii) credit underwriting; (iv) asset growth; (v) earnings; and (vi) compensation, fees and benefits. In addition, the federal\n13\nTable of Contents\nbanking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards. These\nguidelines provide nine standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets\nfrom deteriorating.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF). Among other benefits, each Federal\nHome Loan Bank (FHLB) serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is\nfinanced primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or\nadvances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the individual\nFHLB. The FHLB-SF utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of $100 per share, which may be issued, exchanged,\nredeemed and repurchased only at par value. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own FHLB –SF capital stock in an\namount equal to the greater of:\n• a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of $25 million (100% of “membership asset value” as defined), or\n• an activity-based stock requirement (based on percentage of outstanding advances).\nThe FHLB – SF capital stock is redeemable with five year’s written notice, subject to certain conditions. At December 31,\n2023, the Bank owned 67,374 shares of the FHLB-SF capital stock valued at $6,737,400.\nFederal Reserve Bank\nThe FRB no longer requires depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their\ntransaction accounts and non-personal time deposits.\nAs a member of the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank is required to subscribe to the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of San\nFrancisco in an amount equal to 6% of the Bank’s capital and surplus of which 3% must be paid in and 3% is subject to call by\nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Capital stock shares may not be transferred or hypothecated. The\ncapital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank is divided into shares of $100 each.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank owned 38,567 shares of FRB-SF stock with paid-in capital totaling $1,929,850.\nConsumer Regulation\nThe Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern relationships with\ncustomers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the\nTruth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure\nAct, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service\nMembers Civil Relief Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding\nunfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential\nliability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank\nregulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer\nprotection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action\nby the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and civil money penalties. Failure to comply\nwith consumer protection regulations may result in the failure to obtain required bank regulatory approval for merger or\nacquisition transactions or other transactions where approval is not required.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection\nlaws. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and\npromote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has broad supervisory,\nexamination, and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require\nreimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as\ninjunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain\ncease and desist orders providing for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. State regulation of financial products and\npotential enforcement actions could also adversely affect business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example,\non November 29, 2021, the DFPI proposed rules under the California Consumer Financial Protection Law to allow the DFPI to\nrequire businesses that provide financial products such as debt settlement, student debt relief, education financing, and wage-\nbased advances to register with the DFPI and provide records to facilitate the oversight of the registrants in their interaction\n14\nTable of Contents\nwith consumers in California. The DFPI’s expanding its authority to have an increased emphasis on consumer protection that\nmay be viewed as an effort to create a state-run equivalent of the CFPB.\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nThe PATRIOT Act, designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has\nsignificant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money.\nThe PATRIOT Act, as implemented by various federal regulatory agencies, requires the Company and the Bank to establish\nand implement policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious\nactivity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. The PATRIOT Act and\nits underlying regulations permit information sharing for counter-terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies\nand financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB, the FDIC\nand other federal banking agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when\nconsidering a bank holding company acquisition and/or a bank merger.\nThe Bank regularly evaluates and continues to enhance the systems and procedures to continue to comply with the PATRIOT\nAct and other anti-money laundering initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs\nto combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious\nlegal, strategic, and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material fines and sanctions.\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ACT OF 2020\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act) was enacted effective January 1, 2021 and presents the most\ncomprehensive revisions and enhancements to anti-money laundering and counter terrorism laws since the Currency and\nForeign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (BSA). The impact of the new legislation\nwill not be fully known until required regulations are adopted and implemented, but the AML Act represents significant\nchanges and reaffirms and broadens the government’s oversight and commitment to addressing the illicit activities and\nfinancing of terrorism.\nMany of the provisions of the AML Act deal with the operations of the federal agencies primarily responsible for addressing\nterrorism financing and the safeguarding of the national security of the United States, such as the U.S. Treasury and its\nFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), including the requirement for FinCEN to engage anti-money laundering\n(AML) and terrorist financing investigations experts and the requirement to facilitate information sharing with other federal and\nstate and even foreign law enforcement agencies. On June 30, 2021, FinCEN issued the first government-wide priorities for\nanti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism to encourage banks to incorporate the priorities into their risk-\nbased BSA compliance programs. The priorities identified were:\n• (i) corruption;\n• (ii) cybercrime and cybersecurity;\n• (iii) terrorist financing;\n• (iv) fraud;\n• (v) transnational crime organizations;\n• (vi) drug trafficking;\n• (vii) human trafficking; and\n• (viii) proliferation financing through support networks.\nThe AML Act also expands the reach of federal AML laws by extending their applicability to a broader range of industries,\nsuch as entities involved in futures, precious metals, precious stones and jewels, antiquities, and cryptocurrency. On September\n24, 2021, FinCEN issued proposed rules to include a person engaged in the trade of antiquities under the definition of “financial\ninstitution” subjecting such person to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\nThe AML Act aims to balance the burdens imposed by reporting on financial institutions and the benefits derived by Federal\nlaw enforcement agencies. The AML Act requires a review of currency transaction and suspicious activity reports submitted by\nfinancial institutions to determine to what extent the reporting can be streamlined and made more useful. Included is the\nobligation to review the dollar thresholds for reporting currency transactions and to establish automated processes for filing\nsimple, non-complex categories of reports. It calls for greater integration between financial institution systems and the\nelectronic filing system to allow for automatic population of report fields and the submission of transaction data.\nOther provisions of the AML Act enhance enforcement. The Act provides protection for financial institutions keeping open a\ncustomer’s account or transaction at the request of a federal law enforcement agency or at the request of a state or local agency\nwith the concurrence of FinCEN and increases civil penalties for financial institutions and persons violating the recordkeeping\n15\nTable of Contents\nand reporting obligations. Persons found to have committed repeated “egregious violations” may be barred from serving on\nboards of directors of financial institutions and fined in an amount that is equal to the profit gained by such person by reason of\nsuch violation. If that person is a partner, director, officer or employee of a financial institution, that person may be ordered to\nrepay any bonus paid to that person, irrespective of the amount of the bonus or how it was calculated. New criminal penalties\nhave been created for concealing from or misrepresenting to a financial institution any material facts concerning:\n• (i) the ownership or control of assets involved in a monetary transaction involving a senior foreign political figure in\namounts exceeding $1 million; or\n• (ii) the source of funds in a monetary transaction involving an entity found to be a primary money laundering concern.\nThe AML Act also authorize the Treasury to pay whistleblower awards leading to fines or forfeitures of at least $50,000 up to\nthe lower of $150,000 or 25% of the fine or forfeiture and allows for the payment to whistleblowers of up to 30% of the fine or\nforfeiture.\nOne of the most significant portions of the AML Act is The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which will requires the\nreporting of certain information regarding “beneficial owners” of “reporting companies” to a confidential FinCEN database.\nReporting companies are defined as any corporation, limited liability company or other entity formed in the U.S. under the laws\nof a state or Indian Tribe or registered as a foreign entity to do business in the U.S., other than those specifically excluded, such\nas:\n• (i) companies reporting or with a class of securities registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1934;\n• (ii) banks, bank holding companies, and credit unions;\n• (iii) money transmitters, registered broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies;\n• (iv) public utilities and insurance companies;\n• (v) 503(c)(3) entities;\n• (vi) entities that employ more than 20 employees, have reported gross receipts or sales to the Internal Revenue Service\nin excess of $5.0 million in the prior year, and have an operating presence in the U.S.; and\n• (vii) certain “inactive” entities.\nA beneficial owner is any individual who directly, or indirectly exercises substantial control over an entity or owns or controls\n25% or more of the ownership interest of an entity. The reporting company is required to provide FinCEN with the legal name,\ndate of birth, current resident or business address, and an acceptable identification number of the beneficial owner. In 2022,\nFinCEN issued a final rule requiring the reporting of beneficial ownership information by entities “created” or “doing business”\nin the United States before January 1, 2024, beginning January 1, 2025.\nUnder the CTA, the Treasury is to minimize the burden on reporting companies and ensure the information deposited in the\ndatabase is maintained in the strictest confidence and made available for inspection or disclosure by FinCEN only for the\npurposes set forth in the AML Act and only to:\n• (i) federal agencies engaged in national security, intelligence or law enforcement;\n• (ii) state, local or Tribal law enforcement agencies, subject to authorization by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n• (iii) financial institutions subject to customer due diligence requirements with the consent of the reporting company;\n• (iv) requests by a federal or other appropriate regulatory agency;\n• (v) certain Treasury officials for tax administration purposes;\n• (vi) authorized federal agencies on behalf of a properly recognized foreign authority.\nDuring 2022, FinCEN issued proposed regulations for a pilot program to permit financial institutions to share suspicious\nactivity information with their foreign branches, subsidiaries and affiliates to combat illicit finance risks under the AML Act.\nThe foregoing is only a summary of selected provisions of the AML Act. Given that regulations implementing the new AML\nAct are being proposed but have not yet been adopted or implemented, the Company cannot determine at this time the effect, if\nany, the AML Act will have on the Company’s future results of operations or financial condition.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Regulation\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated\nnationals, and others. These rules are based on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting\ndesignated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i)\nrestrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from\nand exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making\ninvestments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in\n16\nTable of Contents\nwhich the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of\nproperty subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g.,\nproperty and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC.\nFailure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences, and result in civil\nmoney penalties on the Company and the Bank.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) generally requires the Bank to identify the communities it serves and to make loans\nand investments, offer products, make donations in, and provide services designed to meet the credit needs of these\ncommunities. The CRA also requires the Bank to maintain comprehensive records of its CRA activities to demonstrate how we\nare meeting the credit needs of the Bank’s communities. These documents are subject to periodic examination by the FRB.\nDuring these examinations, the FRB rates such institutions’ compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to\nImprove” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the FRB to take into account the record of a bank in meeting the\ncredit needs of all of the communities served, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, in determining such rating.\nFailure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from\nundertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” as of its most recent\nexamination. In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company, when applying to acquire a bank, savings\nassociation, or a bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA record of each depository institution of the applicant\nbank holding company in considering the application.\nCustomer Information Privacy and Cybersecurity\nThe FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, and non-public\ncustomer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its\nboard of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information\nsecurity program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated\nthreats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such\ninformation that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information\nsecurity program to comply with these requirements.\nIn March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial\ninstitutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk\nmanagement processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to\nreliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that\na financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the\nrapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware.\nA financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and\naddress rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type\nof cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including\nfinancial penalties.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted new rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management,\nstrategy, governance, and incidents by public companies. There are two main components:\n• Material cybersecurity incidents must be filed on Form 8-K within four business days of a determination that a\ncybersecurity incident is material.\n• Annual disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance must be disclosed on Form 10-K. The\nCompany’s cybersecurity disclosure can be found in Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\nPrivacy\nThe GLBA and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and\nprocedures regarding the disclosure of non-public personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In\ngeneral, the statutes require disclosures to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such non-public\npersonal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information except as provided in the\nBank’s policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions that are distributed\nregularly to all existing and new customers of the Bank.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOther Aspects of Banking Law\nThe Bank is subject to federal statutory and regulatory provisions covering, among other things, security procedures,\nmanagement interlocks, funds availability and truth-in-savings. There are also a variety of federal statutes that regulate\nacquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies, and the activities beyond owning banks that are\npermissible.\nMoreover, additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before Congress, the California Legislature, and other\ngovernment bodies in the future which, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship\namong financial institutions and may subject the bank holding companies and banks to increased supervision and disclosure,\ncompliance costs and reporting requirements. In addition, the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and\nregulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation. Bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in\nresponding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and this has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement\nactions to financial institutions requiring action to address credit quality, liquidity and risk management, capital adequacy,\ncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as other safety and soundness concerns.\nIt cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the\nextent to which the Bank’s businesses would be affected thereby. In addition, the outcome of examinations, any litigation, or\nany investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may result in necessary changes in the Bank’s operations and\nincreased compliance costs.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company employed 114 full-time equivalent staff as of December 31, 2023. The employees are not represented by a\ncollective bargaining unit, and the Company believes its relationship with its employees is good.\nThe Company’s ability to attract, retain, and develop employees is a key to its success. We provide competitive pay that is\nconsistent with the employee’s position and experience. Annual increases in compensation are based on merit, which is\ndocumented throughout internal systems and communicated at the time of review and upon promotion or transfer. Certain\nemployees participate in the Company’s performance-based incentive programs, which may include additional bonus and\nincentive compensation and equity-based awards. Certain benefits are subject to eligibility, vesting, and performance\nrequirements. Employee performance is measured formally at least annually.\nOur employees’ health, wellness, and safety are a priority to the Company. Employees receive a comprehensive benefits\npackage that includes paid time off, sick time, Company matching contributions of 100% up to 4% of salary contributions to a\nqualified retirement plan, and other health and wellness benefits including participation in Company paid or subsidized medical,\ndental, term-life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term disability insurance, and employee assistance programs.\nThe Company’s code of ethics prohibits discrimination or harassment.

This report describes the overall status of the\ninformation security program and the Bank’s compliance with these guidelines.\n• The report discusses material matters related to the information security program, addressing issues such as: risk\nassessment; risk management and control decisions; service provider arrangements; results of testing; security\nbreaches or violations and management’s responses; and recommendations for changes in the information security\nprogram.\n• The intent of this report is to communicate the overall status of the information security program, including any\nupdates to the program components.\n• In regard to cybersecurity threats and controls, the information security program addresses the Bank’s cybersecurity\nstrategy.\n• Cybersecurity is an element of information security. Information security deals with information, regardless of its\nformat – paper documents, digital and intellectual property, and verbal or visual communications.\n• Cybersecurity focuses on protecting digital assets from intentional attacks. These assets include networks, computer\nhardware/software, and information that is processed, stored, or transported by networked systems and devices.\n• The Information Security Program was initially designed, and is regularly updated, to comply with the following laws\nand regulations:\n◦ The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) regarding protection of nonpublic personal information,\n◦ The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information\nSecurity Standards,”\n◦ Supplemental federal and state banking regulations and guidelines regarding protection of nonpublic\ncustomer information, as applicable to this program.\n• Oversight of the Bank’s cybersecurity program is the responsibility of the IT Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThis committee is also responsible for approving the program’s budget and staffing. Management of the program is\nthe responsibility of the Bank’s information security officer.\n• To ensure appropriate segregation of duties, the information security officer is independent of IT operations staff and\nreports to the Bank’s chief risk officer. The information security officer is responsible for responding to security\nevents by ordering emergency actions to protect the institution and its customers from imminent loss of information;\nmanaging the negative effects on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or value of information; and minimizing\nthe disruption or degradation of critical services.\n• The IT Committee of the Board of Directors meets bi-monthly, or as needed, to review risks resulting from\ncybersecurity threats.\n• Testing is conducted annually using external third-party penetration testing and internal vulnerability assessments.\nWhile cybersecurity risks have the potential to materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of\noperations, the Company does not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats or attacks, including as a result of any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, have materially affected the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial\ncondition. However, the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and the Company’s cybersecurity risk\nmanagement and strategy may be insufficient or may not be successful in protecting against all cyber incidents. Accordingly,\nno matter how well designed or implemented the Company’s controls are, it will not be able to anticipate all cyber security\nbreaches, preventative measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all\npotential risks, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against cyber security breaches in\na timely manner.\nItem 2 - Properties\nThe Company provides traditional banking services through twelve branches and two loan production offices located primarily\nthroughout California’s Central Valley. Bank branches are located in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties. The\nCompany also has nine remote ITM locations. Both loan production offices are housed at branch facilities in Fresno County.\nThe administration building is located in Fresno, California, and does not provide branch services.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held leases for six of the branches and the nine remote ITM locations, and owned the\nremaining six branches. The Company also owns its headquarters in Fresno, California. Most of the leases have renewal\noptions and, in management’s opinions, all properties are adequately covered by insurance. The Company considers its existing\nfacilities to be sufficient for current and future use. Please see “Note 5 - Premises and equipment” and “Note 9 - Leases” in the\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further detail.\n19\nTable of Contents\nItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.

Dividends paid to shareholders are subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation\nLaw, which provides that a California corporation may make a distribution, including paying dividends on its capital stock,\nfrom retained earnings to the extent that the retained earnings exceed (a) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (b) the\namount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights. Alternatively, a California corporation may\nmake a distribution, if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum of (a) its total\nliabilities plus (b) the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of\nshareholders receiving the distribution. As a bank holding company without significant assets other than its equity position in\nthe Bank, the ability to pay dividends to shareholders depends primarily upon dividends received from the Bank. Such\ndividends paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to certain limitations.

This grant reflects director compensation for a portion of the second quarter of\n2023. The number of shares received in lieu of cash was calculated based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock\non September 1, 2023, which was $7.21 per share. The shares of common stock issued to the former non-employee director\ncontain a Rule 144 restrictive legend and are exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.\nWe believed that Section 4(a)(2) was available because: (i) the issuance did not involve underwriters, underwriting discounts,\nor commissions, (ii) the shares issued are restricted stock with transfer restrictions, (iii) no sales were made by general\nsolicitation or advertising, and (iv) the sales were made to an accredited investor.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $3 million of the outstanding common\nstock of the Company.

The principal business of United Security Bancshares is to serve as the holding\ncompany for its wholly-owned subsidiary, United Security Bank. References to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank\ntogether with its wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. References to the “Company” refer to United\nSecurity Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

The Bank currently has twelve banking branches,\nwhich provide banking services in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara counties in the state of California. In addition to full-\nservice branches, the Bank has several stand-alone ITM machines within its geographic footprint.\nExecutive Summary\nDuring 2023, the Company focussed on its strategy of serving the banking needs of its customers and retaining deposit balances\nin a competitive deposit rate environment.\n2023 Financial Summary and 2022 Comparison\n▪ Net income increased to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $15.7 million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\n▪ Loan interest income increased $11.1 million to $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n▪ Total assets decreased 6.8% to $1.21 billion, compared to $1.30 billion at December 31, 2022.\n▪ Total loans, net of unearned fees, decreased 6.1% to $920.0 million, compared to $980.2 million at December 31,\n2022.\n▪ Total investments decreased 12.4%, or $26.2 million, to $184.6 million, compared to $210.9 million at December 31,\n2022.\n▪ Total deposits decreased 13.8% to $1.00 billion, compared to $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022.\n▪ The total fair value of the junior subordinated debentures (TRUPs) changed by $270,000 during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.

One of the primary strategic\ngoals of the Company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk, and to\nfinance those assets with a low-cost and stable source of funds. Liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the\nplanning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth.\nBecause the Bank primarily conducts banking operations in California’s Central Valley, its operations and cash flows are\nsubject to changes in the economic condition of the Central Valley. Our business results are dependent in large part upon the\nbusiness activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in the Central Valley, and declines in economic\nconditions can have adverse material effects upon the Bank. In addition, the Central Valley remains largely dependent on\nagriculture. A downturn in agriculture and agricultural-related business could indirectly and adversely affect the Company as\nmany borrowers and customers are involved in, or are impacted to some extent by, the agricultural industry. While a great\nnumber of our borrowers are not directly involved in agriculture, they would likely be impacted by difficulties in the\nagricultural industry since many jobs in our market areas are ancillary to the regular production, processing, marketing and sale\nof agricultural commodities. The agricultural industry has been affected by declines in prices and changes in yields of various\ncrops and other agricultural commodities. Weaker prices could reduce the cash flows generated by farms and the value of\nagricultural land in our local markets and thereby increase the risk of default by our borrowers or reduce the foreclosure value\nof agricultural land and equipment that serve as collateral of our loans. In particular, farm income has seen recent declines, and\nin line with the downturn in farm income, farmland prices are coming under pressure.\nThe state of California periodically experiences severe droughts resulting in significantly reduced water allocations for farmers\nin the Central Valley. Due to these water issues, the impact on businesses and consumers located in the Company’s market\nareas is not possible to quantify. In response, the California state legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct with the purpose of promoting better local and regional management of groundwater use and sustainable groundwater\nmanagement in California by 2042. The local districts began to develop, prepare, and implement the Groundwater\nSustainability Plans in 2020. The effect of such plans on Central Valley agriculture, if any, is still unknown.\nThe Company’s earnings are impacted by monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The\nFRB has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of depository institutions through its\npower to implement national monetary policy, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The FRB affects the\nlevels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its\nregulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks, and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks\nare subject. The FOMC has indicated that due to elevated inflation it expects to continue to raise interest rates in the near term,\nalbeit at a reduced pace. While it had been expected that the FRB would continue to raise short-term interest rates in 2023, it is\nunknown what effects the recent banking turmoil and current international instability will have on inflation, the FRB’s\nmonetary policies, and the elevated potential for a recession in the US economy. It is possible that interest rates will hold at\ncurrent levels or decline.\nInflation may negatively affect the market value of investment securities and lead to increased interest expense on deposits and\nhigher costs for borrowings as well as increased labor costs due to higher wages. Additionally, increased inflation levels could\nlead to higher oil and gas prices, which may negatively impact the net operating income of borrowers and affect their ability to\nrepay their loans.\nElevated inflation and expectations for elevated future inflation can adversely impact economic growth, consumer and business\nconfidence, and our financial condition and results. In addition, elevated inflation may cause unexpected changes in monetary\npolicies and actions which may adversely affect consumer confidence, the economy, and our financial condition and results.\nSupply chain constraints and a tightening of labor markets could potentially exacerbate inflation and sustain it at elevated\nlevels, even as growth slows. The risk of sustained high inflation would likely be accompanied by monetary policy tightening\nwith potential negative effects on various elevated asset classes.\nThe Company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area.\nBalance sheet management, enhancing revenue sources, and maintaining market share will continue to be of primary\nimportance.\n23\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected historical consolidated financial information for each of the years in the three-year period\nended December 31, 2023.

The increase of $4.1 million between\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 is primarily the result of increases in net interest income, offset by increases in\ninterest paid on deposits and short-term borrowings. Interest income increased by $11.1 million, or 22.6%, between\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The provision for income taxes increased by $1.3 million, or 20.5%.\nReturn on average assets was 1.57% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 1.16% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Return on average equity was 17.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 13.75% for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nThe higher return on average assets experienced by the Company between 2023 and 2022 resulted from increases in income\ndue to the higher interest rates reflected in the loan and investment portfolios, and a decrease in average assets. Increases in the\nreturn on average equity were the result of growth in net income outpacing growth in shareholder’s equity. The growth in\nequity is affected by our dividend payout ratio as well as changes in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is the difference between the interest and fees received on\nearning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and, to a lesser\nextent, investments in securities issued by federal, state and local authorities, and corporations, as well as interest-bearing\ndeposits and overnight investments in federal funds loaned to other financial institutions. These earning assets are funded by a\ncombination of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, primarily customer deposits, and may include short-term and\nlong-term borrowings.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses was $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an\nincrease of $3.3 million, or 7.1%, compared to net interest income before provision for credit losses of $46.1 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. Market rate increases and disciplined deposit pricing saw the net interest margin, as shown in\nTable 1 below, increase to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increases in yields are a result of repricing of variable-rate\nloans, floating-rate investment securities, and higher rates on interest-bearing deposits at FRB. The yield on the loan portfolio\nwas 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, total interest income increased approximately $11.1 million, or 22.6%, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, reflective of increases of $11.1 million in loan interest income and $1.3 million in investment income,\noffset by decreases of $1.3 million in interest-bearing deposits held at FRB. Average interest-earning assets decreased\napproximately $86.4 million between 2023 and 2022 and the rate on interest-earning assets increased 127 basis points between\nthe two periods. The decrease in average earning assets between 2023 and 2022 was the result of a decrease of $116.4 million\nin interest-bearing deposits held with the FRB, partially offset by increases of $29.8 million in loans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, total interest expense increased approximately $7.9 million, or 246.0%, as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, due to increased expenses on deposits and short-term borrowings. Between the two\nperiods, average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $13.7 million, and the average rates paid on these liabilities increased\nby 109 basis points. While the Company may utilize brokered deposits as an additional source of funding, the Company held\nno brokered deposits at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the year-to-date averages of the components of interest-earning assets as a percentage of total\ninterest-earning assets, and the components of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities:\nYear-to-Date Average\n2023 2022\nLoans 82.11 % 74.02 %\nInvestment securities available for sale 17.36 % 16.16 %\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB 0.53 % 9.82 %\nTotal earning assets 100.00 % 100.00 %\nNOW accounts 18.90 % 18.49 %\nMoney market accounts 42.98 % 53.92 %\nSavings accounts 16.46 % 16.70 %\nTime deposits 11.46 % 9.44 %\nSubordinated debentures 1.49 % 1.45 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 100.00 % 100.00 %\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvisions for credit losses are determined on the basis of management’s periodic credit review of the loan portfolio,\nconsideration of past loan loss experience, current and future economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. After reviewing\nthese factors, management, at times, makes adjustments in order to maintain an allowance for credit losses adequate for the\ncoverage of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Based on the condition of the loan portfolio, management believes\nthe allowance is appropriate to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, a $1.5 million provision was made to the allowance for credit losses. A provision\ntotaling $1.8 million was made for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to 1.70% of total loans at December 31, 2023, as compared to 1.04% at December 31,\n2022. The provision of $1.8 million recorded in 2022, and the provision of $1.5 million recorded during 2023, are a result of\ncharge-offs recognized primarily within the student loan portfolio and adjustment in qualitative factors related to economic\nuncertainties. For further discussion, refer to “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations – Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses.”\nThe increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of the current expected credit loss (CECL)\naccounting standard, which was effective as of January 1, 2023. The adoption resulted in an increase of $6.4 million to the\nbalance of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the provision during the year, is primarily the result of charge-offs in\nthe student loan portfolio, offset by decreases in loan balances.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated:\n(In thousands) 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total\nCustomer service fees $ 2,918 52.40 % $ 3,027 164.69 %\nIncrease in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance 557 10.00 % 555 30.20 %\nGain (loss) on fair value of marketable equity securities 39 0.70 % (429) (23.34) %\nGain on proceeds from bank-owned life insurance 907 16.29 % — —\nGain (loss) on fair value of junior subordinated debentures 274 4.92 % (2,533) (137.81) %\nGain on sale of investment securities — — % 30 1.63 %\nLoss on sale of assets — — % (10) (0.55) %\nOther 874 15.69 % 1,198 65.18 %\nTotal $ 5,569 100.00 % $ 1,838 100.00 %\n28\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services provided to banking customers, fair value\nadjustments to the value of the junior subordinated debentures, and, to a lesser extent, loss on sales of Company assets and other\nmiscellaneous income.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $3.7 million, or 203.0%, when compared to 2022.\nCustomer service fees, the primary component of noninterest income, decreased $109,000, or 3.6%, between the two periods.\nThe increase in noninterest income of $3.7 million between the two periods is primarily the result of changes in the fair value of\njunior subordinated debentures. A gain of $274,000 was recorded during the year ended 2023 as compared to a loss of $2.5\nmillion during 2022. The change in the fair value of junior subordinated debentures was primarily caused by fluctuations in the\nSOFR yield curve. Also adding to the increase, were proceeds of $907,000 from bank-owned life insurance and a positive\nchange in the market value of equity securities of $468,000.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning\nassets for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n% of % of\nAverage Average\nEarning Earning\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Assets Amount Assets\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 13,157 1.14 % $ 11,833 0.96 %\nOccupancy expense 3,739 0.33 % 3,467 0.28 %\nData processing 784 0.07 % 686 0.06 %\nProfessional fees 4,366 0.38 % 4,058 0.33 %\nRegulatory assessments 727 0.06 % 794 0.06 %\nDirector fees 438 0.04 % 452 0.04 %\nCorrespondent bank service charges 80 0.01 % 93 0.01 %\nNet cost of operation of OREO 201 0.02 % 102 0.01 %\nOther 2,462 0.21 % 2,554 0.21 %\nTotal $ 25,954 2.26 % $ 24,039 1.94 %\nNoninterest expense increased $1.9 million, or 8.0%, between the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net increase\nin noninterest expense between the comparative periods is primarily the result of increases in salaries and employee benefits,\nprofessional fees, and occupancy expense. The increase in salaries and employee benefits for the year are related to increased\nsalary expense, group insurance costs, and bonus accruals. Increases in professional fees are related to increases in service\ncontracts while increases in occupancy expense are related to increased depreciation expense. Included in net costs of\noperations of OREO for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are OREO operating expenses totaling $126,000 and\n$102,000, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $141,000\nand $185,000 respectively. This expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book\npurposes and income reported for tax purposes, as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the statements of\noperations and comprehensive income. As pretax income or loss amounts become greater, the impact of these differences\nbecomes less significant and is reflected as variances in the effective tax rate for the periods presented. In general, the\npermanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates\nshown in the statements of income and comprehensive income. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023\nwas 28.0% compared to 28.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to non-taxable proceeds\nfrom bank-owned life insurance received during 2023.\n29\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth key financial data as of and for the years ended:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nDue from Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) $ 207 $ 6,945 $ (6,738) (97.0) %\nLoans, net of unearned income $ 904,384 $ 969,996 $ (65,612) (6.2) %\nInvestment securities $ 184,620 $ 210,860 $ (26,240) (12.4) %\nTotal assets $ 1,211,045 $ 1,299,193 $ (88,148) (6.8) %\nTotal deposits $ 1,004,477 $ 1,165,484 $ (161,007) (13.8) %\nTotal liabilities $ 1,088,503 $ 1,186,730 $ (98,227) (8.3) %\nAverage interest-earning assets $ 1,150,280 $ 1,236,641 $ (86,361) (7.0) %\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities $ 725,075 $ 738,766 $ (13,691) (1.9) %\nNet loans decreased due to loan paydowns and payoffs. Investment securities decreased due to principal repayments and\ntreasury-security maturities. Both overnight interest-bearing deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank and federal funds sold and\ntotal deposits decreased due to declines in interest- and non-interest bearing deposits.\nLoans\nThe Company’s primary business is that of acquiring deposits and making loans, with the loan portfolio representing the largest\ncomponent of earning assets. Gross loans totaled $921.3 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $60.5 million, or 6.2%,\nfrom $981.8 million at December 31, 2022. During 2023, average loans increased 3.3% when compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Average loans totaled $955.4 million and $924.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans, net of unearned income, outstanding by category and the category\npercentages as of the year-end dates indicated:\n2023 2022\nDollar Dollar\n(In thousands) Amount % of Loans Amount % of Loans Change\nCommercial and industrial $ 53,347 5.8 % $ 57,902 5.9 % $ (4,555)\nReal estate mortgage 646,709 70.3 % 671,521 68.5 % $ (24,812)\nRE construction & development 127,944 13.9 % 153,374 15.6 % $ (25,430)\nAgricultural 49,795 5.4 % 52,722 5.4 % $ (2,927)\nInstallment and student loans 42,247 4.6 % 44,659 4.6 % $ (2,412)\nTotal loans $ 920,042 100.0 % $ 980,178 100.0 % $ (60,136)\nLoan volume continues to be highest in what has historically been the Bank’s primary lending emphasis: real estate mortgage\nand construction lending. Total loans decreased 6.1% during 2023. Real estate construction and development loans decreased\n16.6%, commercial and industrial loans decreased 7.9%, agricultural loans decreased 5.6%, installment loans decreased 5.4%,\nand real estate mortgage loans decreased 3.7%.\nThe real estate mortgage loan portfolio, totaling $646.7 million at December 31, 2023, consists of commercial real estate,\nresidential mortgages, and home equity loans. Commercial real estate loans have remained a significant percentage of total\nloans over the past year, amounting to 42.0% and 40.6%, of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, respectively. Commercial real estate balances decreased to $386.1 million at December 31, 2023 from $398.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. Commercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short- to medium-term, fixed and floating rate\ninstruments and are mainly secured by commercial income and multi-family residential properties. Residential mortgage loans\nare generally 30-year amortizing loans with an average life of six to eight years. These loans totaled $260.5 million or 28.3%\nof the portfolio at December 31, 2023, and $273.4 million, or 27.9% of the portfolio at December 31, 2022. Real estate\n30\nTable of Contents\nmortgage loans in total decreased $24.8 million or 3.7% during 2023. The home equity loan portfolio totaled $36,000 at\nDecember 31, 2023, and $49,000 at December 31, 2022.\nReal estate construction and development loans, representing 13.9% and 15.6% of total loans at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, consist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as land\nacquisition and development, or land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate including\nimproved and unimproved land, as well as single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in\nvarious stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment of construction loans\ngenerally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project or from the sale\nof the constructed homes to individuals.\nPurchased loan participations totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2022. Loan\nparticipations sold decreased from $9.7 million, or 1.0%, of the portfolio at December 31, 2022, to $4.2 million, or 0.5%, at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 52.7% of commercial and industrial loans have floating rates and, although some may be\nsecured by real estate, many are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets. Construction loans are\ngenerally short-term, floating-rate obligations, which consist of both residential and commercial projects. Agricultural loans,\nare primarily short-term, floating-rate loans for crop financing.\nIncluded within the installment loan portfolio are $38.5 million of student loans as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $42.1\nmillion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.6 million. The student loan portfolio consists of unsecured loans to medical and\npharmacy school students in the U.S. and Caribbean. Upon graduation, the loan is placed in a grace period for six months.\nThis may be extended as a deferment to 48 months for graduates enrolling in internship, medical residency, or fellowship. The\nstudent may receive additional deferment for hardship or administrative reasons in the form of forbearance for a maximum of\n36 months throughout the life of the loan. The outstanding balance of student loans that are in school or grace and have not\nentered repayment status totaled $1.7 million at December 31, 2023. Accrued interest on student loans that are in school or\ngrace and totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2023, there were 779 loans within repayment,\ndeferment, and forbearance which represented $20.8 million, $10.2 million, and $5.8 million in outstanding balances,\nrespectively. Student loans have not been purchased or originated since 2019.\nRepayment of the unsecured student loans is premised on the medical and pharmacy students graduating and becoming high-\nincome earners. Under program guidelines, repayment terms can vary per borrower; however, repayment occurs on average\nwithin 10 to 20 years. Additionally, there are non-student, co-borrowers for roughly one-third of the portfolio, providing\nadditional repayment capacity. The average student loan balance per borrower as of December 31, 2023, was approximately\n$107,000. Loan interest rates are variable and currently range from 6.00% to 13.25%.\nAt December 31, 2023, $20.8 million of student loans were in repayment compared to $23.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\nAccrued interest on student loans totaled $3.5 million and $4.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2023, the reserve against the student loan portfolio totaled $6.3 million. Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, $252,000 in accrued interest receivable was reversed, due to charge-offs of $2.6 million. At December 31,\n2022, the reserve totaled $2.6 million and $141,000 in accrued interest was reversed due to charge-offs of $1.3 million.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Bank’s student loan portfolio with activity from December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023:\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 48,456\nCapitalized Interest 2,622\nPayments Received (1,024)\nLoan Consolidations/Payoffs (6,586)\nLoans Charged-off (1,337)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 42,131\nCapitalized Interest 3,712\nPayments Received (1,660)\nLoan Consolidations/Payoffs (3,102)\nLoans Charged-off (2,588)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 38,493\nStudent Loan Finance Corporation (ZuntaFi) is the third-party servicer for the student loan portfolio.

Collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit have been established with several\ncorrespondent banks. The FRB discount window, as well as a securities dealer, may also be accessed as needed.\nFunds may be borrowed in the future as part of the Company’s asset/liability strategy, and may be used to acquire assets as\ndeemed appropriate by management for investment purposes or for capital utilization purposes. Federal funds purchased\n35\nTable of Contents\nrepresent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured. Repurchase agreements are\ncollateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of U.S. Government agencies, and generally have maturities of one\nto six months, but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate. FHLB advances are collateralized by investments in\nFHLB stock, securities, and certain qualifying mortgage loans. Additionally, borrowings collateralized by pledged loans may\nbe secured from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). Credit lines are subject to periodic review by the credit\nlines grantors relative to the Company’s financial statements. Lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time.\nLines of credit with the FRB of $463.5 million and $435.6 million, as well as FHLB lines of credit totaling $128.9 million and\n$2.2 million were available at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains a $50 million\nuncollateralized line of credit with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank, a $20 million uncollateralized line of credit with Zion’s Bank,\nand a $10 million uncollateralized line of credit with US Bank. At December 31, 2023, short-term borrowings totaled $62.0\nmillion and were comprised of a $60.0 million secured, short-term loan from FHLB and an unsecured, overnight borrowing of\n$2.0 million from PCBB. These lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the Federal Funds rate or are indexed to\nshort-term U.S. Treasury rates or SOFR.\nAsset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLending money is the principal business activity, and ensuring appropriate evaluation, diversification, and control of credit risks\nis a primary management responsibility. Losses are implicit in lending activities and the amount of such losses will vary,\ndepending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience\nof borrowers.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), effective January 1, 2023, and utilizes\na current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks,\ntracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. The allowance for credit\nlosses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar characteristics. The Company estimates the\nappropriate level of allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them separately. A loan is\nevaluated individually when it does not share similar risk characteristics with the pool being evaluated, it is evaluated\nindividually. The Company also uses the CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit\nexposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of credit. While the allowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-\nasset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposure is reported as a liability.\nThe eight (8) segments of the loan portfolio are as follows (subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile\nthe amounts to loan classifications reported elsewhere in this report):\nLoan Segments for Allowance for Credit Loss Analysis December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCommercial and business loans $ 53,273 $ 57,770\nGovernment program loans 74 132\nTotal commercial and industrial 53,347 57,902\nReal estate – mortgage:\nCommercial real estate 386,134 398,115\nResidential mortgages 260,539 273,357\nHome improvement and home equity loans 36 49\nTotal real estate mortgage 646,709 671,521\nReal estate construction and development 127,944 153,374\nAgricultural 49,795 52,722\nInstallment and student loans 42,247 44,659\nTotal loans $ 920,042 $ 980,178\n36\nTable of Contents\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans and Specific Reserves:\nThe following table summarizes the components of individually-evaluated loans and their related specific reserves:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Balance Allowance Balance Allowance\nCommercial and industrial $ — $ — $ — $ —\nReal estate – mortgage — — 141 4\nReal estate construction and development 11,390 — 14,436 —\nAgricultural 451 14 1,051 48\nInstallment and student loans — — — —\nTotal individually-evaluated loans $ 11,841 $ 14 $ 15,628 $ 52\nLoans are evaluated individually when risk characteristics are not similar to the pool being evaluated.

This was primarily due to\nadjustments related to the adoption of CECL, offset by decreases in past due and nonaccrual loans and decreases in loan\nbalances as a whole. Increases in installment loans were related to both the CECL adjustment and charge-offs within the student\nloan portfolio. CECL is a forward-looking measure which applies prospective loss rates based on both historical loss patterns\nand a reasonable and supportable forecast on a per loan basis.\nDuring 2022, reserve allocations as a percentage of loans decreased for commercial and industrial, real estate construction and\ndevelopment, and installment and student loans These decreases are a result of a combination of factors including decreases in\ncharge-offs, classified and past due loans, and credit quality improvements. The decrease in reserves was attributed to a\ndecrease in the loss factor for the agricultural segment. Reserves for installment and student loans increased although the\nallowance as a percentage of loans decreased for that segment.\nThe following table sets forth nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nNonaccrual loans $ 11,448 $ 14,544\nAccruing restructured loans — 141\nLoans, past due 90 days or more, still accruing 426 252\nTotal non-performing loans 11,874 14,937\nOther real estate owned 4,582 4,582\nTotal non-performing assets $ 16,456 $ 19,519\nNon-performing loans to total gross loans 1.29 % 1.52 %\nNon-performing assets to total gross loans 1.79 % 1.99 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 136.77 % 70.01 %\nThe accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectability of\ninterest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement. With the exception of\nstudent loans, loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when the payment of principal or interest is 90 days past due, or\nearlier if warranted. Interest collected thereafter is credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the\ncollectability of the net carrying amount of the loan.

As of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, loans past due more than 30 days totaled $13.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nExcept for the loans included in the above tables, there were no loans at December 31, 2023, where the known credit problems\nof a borrower made doubtful the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms resulting in such\nloan being included as nonaccrual or past due at some future date.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s asset/liability management, liquidity strategy, and capital planning are guided by policies, formulated and\nmonitored by the Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) and Management, to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an\nappropriate balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on- and off-balance sheet\nfinancial obligations, including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals, without straining the Company’s\nequity structure. To maintain an adequate liquidity position, the Company relies on, in addition to cash and cash equivalents,\ncash inflows from deposits and short-term borrowings, repayments of principal on loans and investments, and net interest\nincome received. The Company’s principal cash outflows are for loan origination, purchases of investment securities, depositor\nwithdrawals and payment of operating expenses.\nThe Company’s liquid asset base, which generally consists of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and investment\nsecurities, is maintained at levels deemed sufficient to provide the cash necessary to fund loan growth, unfunded loan\ncommitments, and deposit runoff. Included in this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets. This\nis generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans and investment securities, which are higher\nyielding assets compared to cash.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth asset balances for the period ended:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n% Total % Total\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Assets Balance Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 40,784 3.4 % $ 38,595 3.0 %\nLoans, net of unearned income 920,042 76.0 % 980,178 75.4 %\nUnpledged investment securities 98,394 8.1 % 138,568 10.7 %\nAt December 31, 2023, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 91.6% as compared to 84.1% at December 31, 2022.\nLiabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non-core deposits as well as short-term borrowings capability. Core\ndeposits comprised approximately 97.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and 98.7% at December 31, 2022. At\nDecember 31, 2023, short-term borrowing totaled $62.0 million, including a term-loan of $60.0 million at FHLB and an\novernight borrowing of $2.0 million at PCBB. At December 31, 2023, unused lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan\nBank, Pacific Coast Banker’s Bank, Zion’s Bank, Union Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $672.4 million were\ncollateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the Company’s loan portfolio. The carrying value of loans pledged on these\nused and unused borrowing lines totaled $604.0 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no\nborrowings. Credit lines totaling $557.8 million were partially collateralized by pledged loans of $590.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. For a further detail of the Company’s borrowing arrangements, see “Note 8 - Short-Term Borrowings/\nOther Borrowings,” in the consolidated financial statements.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and decreased $180.6 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year: $ 38,595 $ 219,219\nCash flows from operating activities: 21,376 23,700\nCash flows from investing activities: 87,583 (174,233)\nCash flows from financing activities: (106,770) (30,091)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year: $ 40,784 $ 38,595\nNet cash inflows from operations increased to $21.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $23.7\nmillion for the period ended December 31, 2022. The Company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling\n$87.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and net cash outflows of $174.2 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The net cash outflow from financing activities totaling $106.8 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 was due primarily to decreases in demand deposits, NOW and money market accounts, and savings\naccounts. The net cash inflows from investing activities were primarily the result of principal paydowns on securities, treasury\nsecurity maturities, and proceeds from bank-owned life insurance. Net cash outflows from investing activities during the year\nended December 31, 2022, were due to the purchase of residential mortgage loans pools and purchases of investment securities.\nNet cash outflows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, were due to decreases in demand\ndeposits, time deposits, and savings accounts.\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or the\nCompany may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The Company maintains a liquidity risk management\npolicy and contingency funding plan to address and manage this risk. The policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity, sets\nwholesale funding limits, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity\nrequirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. The liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a\nmonthly basis to the Board of Directors. In addition to ongoing monitoring, the Company performs liquidity stress testing in\naccordance with industry best practices to ensure cash flow requirements are met under stressed scenarios.\nThe liquidity of the parent company, United Security Bancshares, is separate from the Bank and is primarily dependent on the\npayment of cash dividends by its subsidiary, United Security Bank, subject to limitations imposed by the Financial Code of the\n41\nTable of Contents\nState of California and federal and state banking regulations. During each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the Bank paid $8.5 million in cash dividends to the parent company.\nCapital and Dividends\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain\nmandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework, the\nCompany and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are\nalso subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nThe Company has adopted a capital plan that includes guidelines and trigger points to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at\nthe Bank and the Company, and that capital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines\ngiven the level of classified assets, concentrations of credit, allowance for credit losses, current and projected growth, and\nprojected retained earnings. The capital plan also contains contingency strategies to obtain additional capital as required to\nfulfill future capital requirements for both the Bank, as a separate legal entity, and the Company on a consolidated basis. The\ncapital plan includes a target for the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total tangible assets equal to or\ngreater than 9%. The Bank’s ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total tangible assets was 12.2% and 10.5% at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company’s equity capital totaled $122.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $112.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid $8.1 million in cash dividends to shareholders.\nFor a more detailed discussion of regulatory capital requirements and dividends, see “Note 21 - Regulatory Matters” to\nthe consolidated financial statements, as well as under the captions “Supervision and Regulation - The Company -\nCapital Adequacy” and “Supervision and Regulation - The Bank - Capital Standards” set forth in Part I, Item I., of this\nAnnual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.\nManagement believes that, under the current regulations, both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the\nforeseeable future.\nReserve Balances\nThe FRB no longer requires depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their\ntransaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was not subject to a reserve\nrequirement.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates of America (GAAP), management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are\ndiscussed below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents the estimated probable credit losses in our loan and investment portfolios and\nis estimated as of December 31, 2023, using CECL. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022, was estimated\nusing the incurred loss model. The Company’s method for assessing the appropriateness of the ACL includes specific\nallowances for individually analyzed loans, formula allowance factors for pools of credits, and qualitative considerations which\ninclude, among other things, current and forecast economic and environmental factors. Allowance factors for loan pools were\nbased on historical loss experience by product type.\nManagement estimates the ACL balance using relevant information from internal and external sources relating to past events,\ncurrent conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool)\n42\nTable of Contents\nbasis when similar risk characteristics exist. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected\ncredit losses, which captures loan balances as of a point in time to form a cohort, and then tracks the respective losses generated\nby that cohort of loans over the remaining life. The Company has identified and accumulated loan cohort historical loss data\nbeginning with the first quarter of 2006 and through the current period. Adjustments to historical loss information are made\nusing qualitative adjustments for differences in relevant current and forecasted loan-specific risk characteristics, such as the\nhistorical timing of losses relative to the loan origination.\nA significant amount of the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis by loan and investment security\ntype when similar risk characteristics exist. Pools are determined based primarily on regulatory reporting codes as the loans\nand investment securities within each pool share similar risk characteristics and there is sufficient historical peer loss data from\nthe FFIEC to provide statistically meaningful support in the models developed for pools where the Company has limited\nhistorical loss experience. Reserves for credit losses identified on a pooled basis are then adjusted for qualitative factors to\nreflect current conditions. The most significant components of qualitative factors used to estimate the ACL are adjustments\nrelating to prevailing economic conditions, concentrations within the loan portfolio, internal factors, and external factors.\nThese estimates are subject to significant judgment and could potentially significantly increase or decrease the ACL.\nCertain loans are not included in pools of loans that are collectively evaluated. The segregation of these loans is based on the\nresults from an analysis of individually identified credits that meet management’s criteria for individual evaluation. These\nloans are first reviewed individually to determine if such loans have a unique risk profile that would warrant individual\nevaluation. Loans where management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due\nunder the original contractual terms are removed from the pools of loans collectively evaluated. They are then specifically\nreviewed and evaluated individually by management for loss potential by evaluating sources of repayment, including collateral\nas applicable, and a specified allowance for credit losses is established where necessary.\nBecause current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events make it inherently difficult to predict the\nanticipated amount of estimated credit losses on loans, management’s determination of the appropriateness of the ACL could\nchange significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the\noverall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the allowance and changes in those\nfactors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally,\nchanges in factors and inputs may move independently of one another, such that improvement in one or certain factors may\noffset deterioration in others. Thus, as a result of the significant size of the loan portfolio, the numerous assumptions in the\nmodel, and the high degree of potential change in such assumptions, there is a high degree of sensitivity to the reported\namounts. Management believes that the ACL was adequate as of December 31, 2023.\nFair Value of Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities\nThe Company elected the fair value option related to its junior subordinated debt. The accounting standards related to fair value\nmeasurements define how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued and require expanded disclosures in regard to\nfinancial instruments carried at fair value. The fair value measurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure\nframework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The\ndegree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing\nobservability. Financial instruments with readily available actively quoted prices, or whose fair value can be measured from\nactively quoted prices of related financial instruments, generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser\ndegree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments that are traded infrequently or not\nquoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of subjectivity. Pricing\nobservability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is\nnew to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Determining fair values under the accounting standards\nmay include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace. For\nexample, fluctuations in financial market interest rates can have a significant impact on the fair value determination, as well as\nthe Company’s selection of bond credit ratings used in pricing modeling. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nfair value adjustments related to the junior subordinated debt resulted in a loss of $270,000 and a gain of $413,000,\nrespectively. (See Notes 10 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about\nfinancial instruments carried at fair value.)\nOther Accounting Policies and Estimates that are Not Considered Critical\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those that may materially affect the financial statements\nand are related to investments, fair value measurements, retirement plans, and intangible assets. The Company bases its\n43\nTable of Contents\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The\nCompany’s policies related to these estimates can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 659) 45\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 47\nConsolidated Statements of Income 48\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) 49\nConsolidated Statements Changes in Shareholders’ Equity 50\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 52\n44\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nUnited Security Bancshares\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Security Bancshares and Subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss),\nchanges in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the\n“consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of\nits operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for\ncredit losses effective January 1, 2023, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326: Financial\nInstruments – Credit Losses (“Topic 326”). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified\nretrospective approach such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with\npreviously applicable generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express\nan opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal\ncontrol over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our audits we are required to obtain\nan understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) No. 2016-13 effective January 1, 2023 utilizing the current expected credit loss cohort methodology analysis, which\nrelies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using\nthe data to determine pool loss experience. The Company’s measurement of expected credit losses on loans is based on\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable\n45\nTable of Contents\nand supportable forecasts. In estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans, the Company estimates loss rates for each\nloan pool based upon historical experience from 2006 to 2023 and adjusts its quantitative model for certain qualitative factors to\nreflect the extent to which management expects current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the\nconditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $15,658,000 as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s allowance for\ncredit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net carrying\nvalue at the amount expected to be collected on such loans and is a material and complex estimate requiring significant\nmanagement judgment in the estimation of expected lifetime losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.\nWe identified the auditing of the allowance for credit losses on loans, including the historical loss rates and management’s\nqualitative adjustments as a critical audit matter. Estimation of the lifetime expected credit losses for loans, particularly as it\nrelates to the historical loss rate methodology and qualitative factors, requires significant management judgment. Auditing\nmanagement’s judgments and assumptions involved significant audit effort as well as especially challenging and subjective\nauditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included testing the Company’s process used to\ndevelop the estimate for the allowance for credit losses on loans by:\na. Evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used.\nb. Evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions and qualitative adjustments used by management by\ncomparing the historical loss rates and qualitative adjustments to the relevant internal and external data, including\nhistorical trends.\nc. Testing the mathematical accuracy of the computation, including testing completeness and accuracy of the internal\ndata used and evaluating the relevance and reliability of the external data used in the calculation, the historical loss\nrates and qualitative adjustments determined by management and used in the calculation.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 26, 2024\nWe have

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\nBasis of Presentation – The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States, with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and with\nprevailing practices within the banking industry. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Security\nBancshares, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, United Security Bank and subsidiary (the “Bank”) and USB Capital Trust II\n(the “Trust”). The Trust is deconsolidated pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810. As a result, the Trust\nPreferred Securities are not presented on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as equity, but instead they are\npresented as Junior Subordinated Debentures and are presented as a separate liability category (see Note 10 to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the\nfollowing notes, references to the Bank are references to United Security Bank. References to the Company are references to\nUnited Security Bancshares (including the Bank). United Security Bancshares operates as one business segment providing\nbanking services to commercial establishments and individuals primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, and the greater Oakhurst/\nEast Madera County area, as well as the Campbell area of Santa Clara County. The Company’s participation loans with other\nfinancial institutions are primarily in the state of California.\nNature of Operations – United Security Bancshares is a bank holding company, incorporated in the state of California for the\npurpose of acquiring all the capital stock of the Bank through a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the\nBank. United Security Bancshares has provided the Company greater operating and financial flexibility and has permitted\nexpansion into a broader range of financial services and other business activities.\nThe Bank was founded in 1987 and currently operates twelve branches, one commercial lending office, one consumer lending\noffice, and one construction lending office in an area from eastern Madera County to western Fresno County, as well as Taft\nand Bakersfield in Kern County, and Campbell in Santa Clara County. The Bank’s primary source of revenue is interest\nincome from loans to customers, who are predominantly small- and middle-market businesses and individuals. The Bank\nengages in a full complement of lending activities, including real estate mortgage, commercial and industrial, real estate\nconstruction, agricultural, and consumer loans, with particular emphasis on short- and medium-term obligations.\nThe Bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments. These include personal and business checking accounts and savings\naccounts, interest-bearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts and time certificates of\ndeposit. Most of the Bank’s deposits are attracted from small- and medium-sized business-related sources and from\nindividuals.\nThe Bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers\nand account holders. These services include cashiers checks, foreign drafts, and person-to-person and bank-to-bank transfers\nfor consumer customers. In addition, the Bank offers internet banking services to its commercial and retail customers. The\nBank does not operate a trust department; however, it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to\nits customers upon request.\nThe Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. (YMP), was incorporated in California on April 17,\n2019, for the purpose of holding specific parcels of real estate acquired by the Bank through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures in\nMonterey County. These properties exceeded the 10-year holding period for other real estate owned, or “OREO.” YMP was\nfunded with a $250,000 cash investment and the transfer of those parcels by the Bank to YMP. As of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, these properties are included within the consolidated balance sheets as part of OREO.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses and fair value of junior subordinated debt (TRUPs).\nSubsequent events - The Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the day\nthe consolidated financial statements were issued.\n52\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies - The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard, commonly referred to as “FASB.” FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that the Company\nfollows to ensure the consistent reporting of its consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations, and\nconsolidated cash flows. References to GAAP issued by FASB in these footnotes are to FASB Accounting Standards\nCodification, sometimes referred to as the Codification, or ASC. The following is a summary of significant policies:\na. Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from correspondent banks.\nAt times throughout the year, balances can exceed FDIC insurance limits. Generally, federal funds sold and repurchase\nagreements are sold for one-day periods. The Bank did not have any repurchase agreements during 2023 or 2022. All cash\nand cash equivalents have maturities when purchased of three months or less.\nb. Securities - Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses\nexcluded from net income and reported, net of tax, as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss) and\nshareholders’ equity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. Gains and losses on\ndisposition are reported using the specific identification method for the adjusted basis of the securities sold. Premiums and\ndiscounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.\nThe Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio on an individual security basis. Securities that are to be held\nfor indefinite periods of time are classified as available-for-sale. Those include, but are not limited to, securities that\nmanagement intends to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy, as well as those which may be sold in\nresponse to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayments, or other factors. Securities which the Company has the\nability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as held-to-\nmaturity as of December 31, 2023.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated when the amortized cost of a security exceeds\nits fair value. If it is determined that it will be necessary to sell a security before the fair value increases to the amortized\ncost, the amortized cost will be written down to fair value through income. At that point, any previously recorded\nallowance for credit loss (ACL) would be written off and any additional impairment would be recognized through earnings.\nIf it is believed that the Company will not be required to sell a security before the fair value recovers, a determination will\nbe made as to whether or not the decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss or noncredit factors such as changes in\ncurrent market rates. If it is determined that the decline is due to a credit loss, the amount recognized as the credit loss will\nbe determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows expected to be collected would be discounted at the\neffective interest rate established at acquisition. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the\namortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses would be recorded for the credit loss, limited by\nthe amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses on investments are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are\ncharged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed\nor when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nMarketable equity securities are reported at fair value with gains and losses included in noninterest income on the\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\nc. Loans - Interest income on loans is credited to income as earned and is calculated by using the simple interest method on\nthe daily balance of the principal amounts outstanding. With the exception of student loans, loans are typically placed on\nnon-accrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days and/or when management believes the collection of\namounts due is doubtful. Student loans are typically placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest is past due for\n120 days. For loans placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed based upon\nmanagement’s assessment of collectability, and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to\neliminate doubt as to the collectability of the net carrying amount of the loan.\nNonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans are deferred and netted\nagainst outstanding loan balances. The net deferred fees and costs are generally amortized into interest income over the\nloan’s term using the simple interest method. Other credit-related fees, such as standby letters of credit fees and loan\nplacement fees, are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed.\nd. Allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded loan commitments - The Company adopted ASU 2016-13,\neffective January 1, 2023, and utilizes the CECL cohort methodology analysis which relies on segmenting the loan\n53\nTable of Contents\nportfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine\npool loss experience. Management estimates the allowance for credit loss balance using relevant available information,\nfrom internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe cumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company’s historical loss\nexperience from 2006 to 2023. The Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience a slight decline\nin economic conditions and an increase in unemployment rate and level and trend of delinquencies over the next year.\nManagement adjusted the historical loss experience through qualitative factors for these expectations.\nThe Company analyzes risk characteristics inherent in each loan portfolio segment as part of the quarterly review of the\nadequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The following summarizes some of the key risk characteristics for the ten\nsegments of the loan portfolio (Consumer loans include three segments):\nCommercial and business loans – Commercial loans are subject to the effects of economic cycles and tend to exhibit\nincreased risk as economic conditions deteriorate, or if an economic downturn is prolonged. The Company considers this\nsegment to be one of higher risk given the size of individual loans and the balance in the overall portfolio.\nGovernment program loans – This is a relatively small part of the Company’s loan portfolio, but has historically had a high\npercentage of loans that have migrated from pass to substandard given their vulnerability to economic cycles.\nCommercial real estate loans – This segment is considered to have more risk in part because of the vulnerability of\ncommercial businesses to economic cycles as well as the exposure to fluctuations in real estate prices because most of these\nloans are secured by real estate. Losses in this segment have however been historically low because most of the loans are\nreal-estate secured, and the bank maintains appropriate loan-to-value ratios.\nResidential mortgages – This segment is considered to have low risk factors based on the Company’s experience and peer\nstatistics. These loans are secured by first deeds of trust.\nHome improvement and home equity loans – Because of their junior lien position, these loans have an inherently higher\nrisk level.\nReal estate construction and development loans –This segment of loans is considered to have a higher risk profile due to\nconstruction and market value issues in conjunction with normal credit risks.\nAgricultural loans – This segment is considered to have risks associated with weather, insects, and marketing issues. In\naddition, concentrations in certain crops or certain agricultural areas can increase risk. Additionally, California may\nexperience severe droughts, which can significantly harm the business of customers and the credit quality of the loans to\nthose customers. Water resources and related issues affecting customers are closely monitored. Signs of deterioration\nwithin the loan portfolio are also monitored in an effort to manage credit quality and work with borrowers where possible\nto mitigate any losses.\nInstallment and student loans – This segment, which includes consumer loans, student loans, overdrafts, and overdraft\nprotection lines, is considered higher risk because most of the loans are unsecured. Additionally, in the case of student\nloans, there are increased risks associated with liquidity due to the time lag between funding of a student loan and eventual\nrepayment.\ne. Nonaccrual loans - Commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans are placed on non-accrual status under the\nfollowing circumstances:\n• When there is doubt regarding the full repayment of interest and principal.\n• When principal and/or interest on the loan has been in default for a period of 90-days or more, unless the asset is\nboth well secured and in the process of collection that will result in repayment in the near future.\n• When the loan is identified as having loss elements and/or is risk rated “8” Doubtful.\nWhen loans are placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest for financial statement purposes is discontinued.\nPreviously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed and charged against interest income. Student loans past due more than\n90-days are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are charged-off once 120-days past due. See “Note 4- Student Loans” for\nspecific information on the student loan portfolio.\n54\nTable of Contents\nWhen a loan is placed on non-accrual status and subsequent payments of interest (and principal) are received, the interest\nreceived may be accounted for in two separate ways.\nCost recovery method: If the loan is in doubt as to full collection, the interest received in subsequent payments is reversed\nout of interest income and treated as a reduction of principal for financial reporting purposes.\nCash basis: This method is only used if the recorded investment or total contractual amount is expected to be fully\ncollectible, under which circumstances the subsequent payments of interest is credited to interest income as received.\nLoans on non-accrual status may be returned to accruing status when all delinquent principal and/or interest has been\nbrought current, there is no identified element of loss (on the contractual amount of the loan), and current and continued\nsatisfactory performance is expected. Repayment ability is generally demonstrated through the timely receipt of at least six\nmonthly payments on a loan with monthly amortization.\nf. Individually-evaluated loans - When a financial asset does not share similar risk characteristics with the pool being\nevaluated, it is evaluated individually.\ng. Collateral-dependent loans - A loan is deemed collateral-dependent when either, it enters foreclosure, or it is determined\nthat the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. Repayment of these loans is expected to be provided substantially\nthrough the operation or sale of the collateral.\nh. Bank-owned life insurance and company-owned life insurance policies - The Company owns bank-owned life insurance\npolicies (BOLI) and company-owned life insurance policies (COLI) on certain officers, including those covered under the\nsalary continuation plan, with a portion of the post-retirement benefit available to the officers’ beneficiaries. The initial net\ncash surrender value of BOLI and COLI policies is equivalent to the premium paid, and adds income through non-taxable\nincreases in cash surrender value, net of the cost of insurance, plus any death benefits ultimately received by the Company.\ni. Off-balance sheet financial instruments - In order to meet the needs of its customers, the Company offers financial\ninstruments including commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (SBLC). SBLCs are used to guarantee\nfinancing arrangements or performance with third parties.\nj. Premises and equipment - Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense\nis computed principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are\nas follows:\nBuildings 31 years Furniture and equipment 3 -7 years\nk. Other-real-estate-owned - Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are to be sold and are\ninitially recorded at fair value of the property, less estimated costs to sell. The excess, if any, of the loan amount over the\nfair value is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent declines in the fair value of other-real-estate-owned,\nalong with related revenue and expenses from operations, are charged to noninterest expense.\nl. Investment in Limited Partnership - The Bank owns an interest in a local area limited partnership which provides private\ncapital for small- to mid-sized businesses. The investment is accounted for under the cost method.\nm. Goodwill - Goodwill amounts resulting from acquisitions are considered to have an indefinite life and are not amortized.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported goodwill totaling $4.5 million. The Company did not recognize\nany impairment charges on goodwill during 2023 or 2022.\nn. Income taxes - Deferred income taxes result from the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the\ntax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities using the liability method, and are reflected at income tax rates applicable\nto the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Estimates are based on the\nenacted tax rate of the applicable period.\no. Net income per common share - Basic income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of\ncommon shares outstanding. Diluted income per share includes the effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive\nsecurities using the treasury stock method. If applicable, net income per common share is retroactively adjusted for all\nstock dividends declared.\n55\nTable of Contents\np. Cash flow reporting - For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, noninterest-\nbearing amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Federal funds and\nsecurities purchased under agreements to resell are generally sold for a one-day periods. Net cash flows are reported for\ninterest-bearing deposits with other banks, loans to customers, deposits held for customers, and short-term borrowings.\nq. Transfers of financial assets - Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been\nsurrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the\nCompany, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain the taking advantage of that right, beyond a\ntrivial benefit) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over\nthe transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase before maturity.\nr. Stock based compensation - The Company maintains a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more\nfully in “Note 12 - Stock Based Compensation.” All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee\nstock options and restricted stock units and awards, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the\ngrant date fair value of the award. The fair value is amortized over the requisite service period (generally the vesting\nperiod). Included in salaries and employee benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $141,000 and\n$185,000, respectively, of stock-based compensation. Also included in stock-based compensation were $337,000 and\n$181,000 in stock grants to Company directors for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\ns. Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock - As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San\nFrancisco (FHLB), the Company is required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. In addition, as a\nmember of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB), the Company is required to maintain an investment in\ncapital stock of the FRB. The investments in both the FHLB and the FRB are carried at cost in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets, are included in other assets, and are subject to certain redemption requirements by the FHLB\nand FRB. Stock redemptions are at the discretion of the FHLB and FRB.\nWhile technically these are considered equity securities, there is no market for the FHLB or FRB stock; therefore, the\nshares are considered restricted investment securities. Management periodically evaluates the stock for other-than-\ntemporary impairment through an assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than the recognition of temporary\ndeclines in value. The determination of the ultimate recoverability of cost is based upon (i) the significance and length of\ntime of any decline in net assets of the FHLB or FRB as compared to the capital stock amount of the FHLB or FRB, (ii\ncommitments by the FHLB or FRB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in\nrelation to the operating performance of the FHLB or FRB, (iii) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on\ninstitutions, and (iv) the liquidity position of the FHLB or FRB.\nt. Comprehensive income (loss) - Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income\n(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses\non securities available-for-sale, unrecognized costs of salary continuation defined benefit plans, and unrealized gains and\nlosses on trust preferred securities related to instrument-specific credit risk. Comprehensive income (loss) is presented in\nthe “Consolidated Statements of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).”\nu. Segment reporting - The Company’s operations solely in the financial services industry and provides its customers\ntraditional banking and other financial services. The Company operates primarily in California’s San Joaquin Valley.\nManagement’s operating decisions and performance assessment are based on an ongoing review of the Company’s\nconsolidated financial results. The Company is considered one operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nv. Revenue from contracts with customers - The Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with\nASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the\ncontract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the\ntransaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies\na performance obligation. The Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest earned on loans,\ninvestment securities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company has\nevaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts\nwith customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the “Consolidated Statements of Income” is not\nwarranted. The Company, in general, satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as services are\nrendered. Transaction prices are typically fixed and are charged either on a periodic basis or as activity warrants.\nContracts evaluated under the scope of Topic 606 are primarily related to service charges, fees on deposit accounts, debit\ncard fees, ITM processing fees, and other service charges, commissions and fees. Because performance obligations are\n56\nTable of Contents\nsatisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying Topic\n606 to the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.\nw. Leases - The Company recognizes lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Disclosures related\nto key lease components and leasing arrangements are included within the footnotes. The Company combines lease and\nassociated non-lease components by class of underlying asset in contract that meet certain criteria. The lease and related\nnon-lease components have the same timing and pattern of transfer, and the lease component, when accounted for on a\nstand-alone basis, is classified as an operating lease.\nx. Recently Issued Accounting Standards -\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for\nrecognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the current expected credit loss, or CECL, model.\nThe CECL model applies to estimated credit losses on loans receivable, held-to-maturity debt securities, unfunded loan\ncommitments, and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Under ASU 2016-13, available-for-sale debt\nsecurities are evaluated for impairment if fair value is less than amortized cost, with any estimated credit losses recorded\nthrough a credit loss expense and an allowance, rather than a write-down of the investment. Changes in fair value that are\nnot credit-related will continue to be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company adopted this standard\nusing a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2023.\nWhile the Company held no other-than-temporarily-impaired securities at that time, a prospective transition was required\nfor debt securities previously classified as such. The Company is phasing the regulatory capital impact of Topic 326 over\nthree years.\nThe following table summarized the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 by loan category:\nAllowance for\ncredit losses Allowance Impact to\nas reported before the allowance of\nunder ASU adoption of adoption of\n(In thousands) 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 ASU 2016-13\nAssets:\nCommercial and industrial:\nCommercial and business loans $ 2,290 $ 954 $ 1,336\nGovernment program loans 2 2 —\nTotal commercial and industrial 2,292 956 1,336\nReal estate mortgage:\nCommercial real estate 2,735 659 2,076\nResidential mortgages 986 703 283\nHome improvement and home equity loans 2 2 —\nTotal real estate mortgage 3,723 1,364 2,359\nReal estate construction and development 4,129 3,408 721\nAgricultural 1,550 525 1,025\nInstallment and student loans 4,855 2,898 1,957\nUnallocated — 1,031 (1,031)\nAllowance for credit losses for all loans $ 16,549 $ 10,182 $ 6,367\nLiabilities:\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures $ 805 $ 532 $ 273\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the\nallowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of\nthe criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).” This ASU provides optional\nexpedients and exceptions for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other\nreference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU was effective for all entities as of\n57\nTable of Contents\nMarch 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Deferral of the Sunset\nDate of Topic 848.” This ASU amends ASU 2020-04 by extending the sunset provision for use of LIBOR as a reference\nrate until December 31, 2024, due to an extension of the intended cessation of USD LIBOR. During 2023, the Company\nchose to use the “Secured Overnight Financing Rate,” or SOFR, as a replacement for LIBOR. This change resulted in\nminimal impact to junior subordinated debt and floating rate loans tied to LIBOR.\nIn March 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This ASU provides new guidance on the treatment of troubled debt restructurings\n(TDRs) in relation to the adoption of the CECL model for the accounting for credit losses (see note above regarding ASU\n2016-13). Previous accounting guidance related to troubled debt restructurings is eliminated and new disclosure\nrequirements are adopted in regard to loan refinancing and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulties under the assumption that the CECL model will capture credit losses related to troubled debt restructurings.\nNew disclosures regarding gross write-offs for financing receivables by year of origination are also included in the update.\nThis update has been adopted as of January 1, 2023. The Bank will no longer report troubled debt restructurings or classify\nloans as such. TDRs previously recognized have been incorporated into the CECL methodology as it applies to loan loss\nreserves as of January 1, 2023.\ny. Subsequent events - Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial\nstatements are issued. Recognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about\nconditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial\nstatements. Nonrecognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the\ndate of the balance sheet but arose after that date.\n2.

There were no losses recorded\ndue to credit-related factors for the periods ended December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, are shown\nbelow:\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value\nAmortized (Carrying\n(In thousands) Cost Amount)\nDue in one year or less $ 12,610 $ 12,534\nDue after one year through five years 28,770 27,466\nDue after five years through ten years 60,018 50,579\nDue after ten years 2,505 2,501\nU.S. Government sponsored entities & agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations 100,486 88,185\n$ 204,389 $ 181,265\nActual cash flows may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or\nwithout call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 2023, the decline in fair value of the available-for-sale securities is attributed to changes in interest\nrates and not credit quality. These declines are primarily the result of the fast pace and large increases in interest rates during\nthe last two years, which have led to decreases in bond prices and increases in yields. Because the Company does not intend to\nsell these securities, and because it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell these securities before their\nanticipated recovery, the Company does not consider it necessary to provide an allowance for any available-for-sale security at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n60\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $39,000 in unrealized gains related to one marketable\nequity security compared to an unrealized loss of $429,000 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company had no held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n3.

The Company’s participation loans with other financial institutions are primarily\nin the state of California.\nCommercial and industrial loans are generally made to support the ongoing operations of small- and medium-sized commercial\nbusinesses. Commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification and provide working capital,\nfinancing for the purchase of manufacturing plants and equipment, or funding for growth and general expansion of businesses.\nA substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases, or other\ncollateral, including real estate. While the remainder are unsecured, those extensions of credit are predicated upon the financial\ncapacity of the borrower. Repayment of commercial and industrial loans generally comes from the cash flow of the borrower.\nReal estate mortgage loans are secured by trust deeds on primarily commercial property and by trust deeds on single family\nresidences. Repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower.\n• Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise the largest segment of this loan category and are available on all\ntypes of income producing and commercial properties, including: office buildings and shopping centers, apartments\nand motels, owner-occupied buildings, manufacturing facilities, and other properties. Commercial real estate\nmortgage loans can also be used to refinance existing debt. Commercial real estate loans typically receive payment\nfrom the borrower’s business operations, rental income associated with the real property, or personal assets.\n• Residential mortgage loans are provided to individuals to finance or refinance single-family residences. Residential\nmortgages are not a primary business line offered by the Company, and a majority are conventional mortgages that\nwere purchased as a pool.\n• Home improvement and home equity loans comprise a relatively small portion of total real estate mortgage loans.\nHome equity loans are generally secured by junior trust deeds, but may be secured by 1st trust deeds.\nReal estate construction and development loans consist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as\nland acquisition and development, or land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate\nincluding improved and unimproved land, as well as single-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial\nproperties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment on\n61\nTable of Contents\nconstruction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the\nproject or from the sale of the constructed homes to individuals.\nAgricultural loans are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory and receivables. Repayment is from the cash flow of the\nborrower.\nInstallment loans consist primarily of student loans as well as loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal\nexpenditures such as credit cards, automobiles or other consumer items. See “Note 4 - Student Loans” for specific information\non the student loan portfolio.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the\nfinancing needs of its customers. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, these financial instruments include commitments to extend\ncredit of $183.5 million and $190.2 million, respectively, and standby letters of credit of $2.9 million and $1.6 million,\nrespectively. These instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance\nsheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for\ncommitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. The\nCompany applies the same credit policies as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established\nin the contract. Substantially all of these commitments are at floating interest rates based on the prime rate. Commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The\namount of collateral obtained, if necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but includes\naccounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing properties.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to\na third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to\ncustomers.\nLoans to directors, officers, principal shareholders and their affiliates are summarized below:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nAggregate amount outstanding, beginning of year $ 3,610 $ 13,100\nRetirement of director during 2022 — (8,899)\nNew loans or advances during year 825 980\nRepayments during year (1,396) (1,571)\nAggregate amount outstanding, end of year $ 3,039 $ 3,610\nUndisbursed commitments, end of year $ 1,525 $ 1,050\n62\nTable of Contents\nKey terms and conditions for loans to directors, officers, principal shareholders and their affiliates do not differ from those of\nother borrowers.\nPast Due Loans\nThe Company monitors delinquent and potentially problematic loans on an ongoing basis through weekly reports to the loan\ncommittee and monthly reports to the Board of Directors.\nThe following is a summary of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees, at December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAccruing\nLoans Loans 90\nLoans Loans 90 or More or\n30-60 Days 61-89 Days Days Past Total Past Current Total More Days\nDecember 31, 2023 Past Due Past Due Due Due Loans Loans Loans Past Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 53,273 $ 53,273 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 74 74 —\nTotal commercial and\nindustrial — — — — 53,347 53,347 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 386,134 386,134 —\nResidential mortgages — — — — 260,539 260,539 —\nHome improvement and home\nequity loans — — — — 36 36 —\nTotal real estate mortgage — — — — 646,709 646,709 —\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans — — 11,390 11,390 116,554 127,944 —\nAgricultural loans — — 45 45 49,750 49,795 —\nInstallment and student loans 791 328 426 1,545 40,702 42,247 426\nTotal loans $ 791 $ 328 $ 11,861 $ 12,980 $ 907,062 $ 920,042 $ 426\nThe following is a summary of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees, at December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nAccruing\nLoans 90 Loans 90\nLoans Loans or More or More\n30-60 Days 61-89 Days Days Past Total Past Current Total Days Past\nDecember 31, 2022 Past Due Past Due Due Due Loans Loans Loans Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 57,770 $ 57,770 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 132 132 —\nTotal commercial and industrial — — — — 57,902 57,902 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 398,115 398,115 —\nResidential mortgages — — — — 273,357 273,357 —\nHome improvement and home\nequity loans 8 — — 8 41 49 —\nTotal real estate mortgage 8 — — 8 671,513 671,521 —\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans — — 12,545 12,545 140,829 153,374 —\nAgricultural loans — — 108 108 52,614 52,722 —\nInstallment and student loans 546 642 252 1,440 43,219 44,659 252\nTotal loans $ 554 $ 642 $ 12,905 $ 14,101 $ 966,077 $ 980,178 $ 252\n63\nTable of Contents\nNonaccrual Loans\nThe following table presents the amortized costs of loans on nonaccrual status and accruing loans more than 90 days past due:\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNonaccrual Nonaccrual\nLoans With Accruing Loans With Accruing\nNo Allowance Total Loans 90 or No Allowance Total Loans 90 or\nFor Credit Nonaccrual More Days For Credit Nonaccrual More Days\n(In thousands) Losses Loans Past Due Losses Loans Past Due\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans 11,403 11,403 — 14,436 14,436 —\nAgricultural loans — 45 — — 108 —\nInstallment and student loans — — 426 — — 252\nTotal $ 11,403 $ 11,448 $ 426 $ 14,436 $ 14,544 $ 252\nThere were no remaining undisbursed commitments to extend credit on nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of its credit monitoring program, the Company utilizes a risk rating system which quantifies the risk the Company\nestimates it has assumed during the life of a loan. The system rates the strength of the borrower and the facility or transaction,\nand is designed to provide a program for risk management and early detection of problems.\nFor each new credit approval, credit extension, renewal, or modification of existing credit facilities, the Company assigns risk\nratings utilizing the rating scale identified in this policy. In addition, on an on-going basis, loans and credit facilities are\nreviewed for internal and external influences which might impact the credit facility and warrant a change in the risk rating.\nEach loan credit facility is given a risk rating that takes into account factors that materially affect credit quality.\nWhen assigning risk ratings, the Company evaluates two risk rating approaches, a facility rating and a borrower rating as\nfollows:\nFacility Rating:\nThe facility rating is determined by the analysis of positive and negative factors that may indicate that the quality of a particular\nloan or credit arrangement requires that it be rated differently from the risk rating assigned to the borrower. The Company\nassesses the risk impact of these factors:\nCollateral - The rating may be affected by the type and quality of the collateral, the degree of coverage, the economic life of the\ncollateral, liquidation value, and the Company’s ability to dispose of the collateral.\nGuarantees - The value of third party support arrangements varies widely. Unconditional guarantees from persons with\ndemonstrable ability to perform are more substantial than that of closely-related persons to the borrower who offer only modest\nsupport.\nUnusual Terms - Credit may be extended on terms that subject the Company to a higher level of risk than indicated in the rating\nof the borrower.\nBorrower Rating:\nThe borrower rating is a measure of loss possibility based on the historical, current and anticipated financial characteristics of\nthe borrower in the current risk environment. To determine the rating, the Company considers at least the following factors:\n- Quality of management\n- Liquidity\n- Leverage/capitalization\n- Profit margins/earnings trend\n64\nTable of Contents\n- Adequacy of financial records\n- Alternative funding sources\n- Geographic risk\n- Industry risk\n- Cash flow risk\n- Accounting practices\n- Asset protection\n- Extraordinary risks\nThe Company assigns risk ratings to loans other than consumer loans and other homogeneous loan pools based on the following\nscale. The risk ratings are used when determining borrower ratings as well as facility ratings. When the borrower rating and\nthe facility ratings differ, the lowest rating applied is:\n- Grades 1 and 2 – These grades include loans which are given to high-quality borrowers with high credit quality and\nsound financial strength. Key financial ratios are generally above industry averages and the borrower’s strong\nearnings history or net worth. These may be secured by deposit accounts or high-grade investment securities.\n- Grade 3 – This grade includes loans to borrowers with solid credit quality with minimal risk. The borrower’s balance\nsheet and financial ratios are generally in line with industry averages, and the borrower has historically demonstrated\nthe ability to manage economic adversity. Real estate and asset-based loans assigned this risk rating must have\ncharacteristics which place them well above the minimum underwriting requirements for those departments. Asset-\nbased borrowers assigned this rating must exhibit extremely favorable leverage and cash flow characteristics, and\nconsistently demonstrate a high level of unused borrowing capacity.\n- Grades 4 and 5 – These include “pass” grade loans to borrowers of acceptable credit quality and risk. The borrower’s\nbalance sheet and financial ratios may be below industry averages, but above the lowest industry quartile. Leverage is\nabove and liquidity is below industry averages. Inadequacies evident in financial performance and/or management\nsufficiency are offset by readily available features of support, such as adequate collateral, or good guarantors having\nthe liquid assets and/or cash flow capacity to repay the debt. While the borrower may have recognized a loss over\nthree or four years, recent earnings trends, while perhaps somewhat cyclical, are improving and cash flows are\nadequate to cover debt service and fixed obligations. Real estate and asset-borrowers who fully comply with all\nunderwriting standards and perform according to projections would be assigned this rating. These also include grade 5\nloans which are “leveraged” or on management’s “watch list.” While still considered pass loans (loans given a grade\n5), the borrower’s financial condition, cash flow, or operations evidence more than average risk and short term\nweaknesses. These loans warrant a higher than average level of monitoring, supervision, and attention from the\nCompany, but do not reflect credit weakness trends that weaken or inadequately protect the Company’s credit position.\nLoans with a grade rating of 5 are not normally acceptable as new credits unless they are adequately secured or carry\nsubstantial endorsers/guarantors.\n- Grade 6 – This grade includes “special mention” loans which are loans that are currently protected but are potentially\nweak. This generally is an interim grade classification and these loans will usually be upgraded to an “acceptable”\nrating or downgraded to a “substandard” rating within a reasonable time period. Weaknesses in special mention loans\nmay, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company’s credit position at some\nfuture date. Special mention loans are often loans which exhibit weaknesses inherent in the loan origination and loan\nservicing, and may have some technical deficiencies. The main theme in special mention credits is the distinct\nprobability that the classification will deteriorate to a more adverse class if the noted deficiencies are not addressed by\nthe loan officer or loan management.\n- Grade 7 – This grade includes “substandard” loans which are inadequately supported by the current sound net worth\nand paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined\nweakness or weaknesses that may impair the regular liquidation of the debt. When a loan has been downgraded to\n“substandard,” there exists a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain a loss if the deficiencies are not\ncorrected.\n- Grade 8 – This grade includes “doubtful” loans which exhibit the same characteristics as the “substandard” loans.\nAdditionally, loan weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions\nand values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain\nimportant and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the loan, its\nclassification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status can be determined. Pending factors include a\n65\nTable of Contents\nproposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and\nrefinancing plans.\n- Grade 9 – This grade includes loans classified “loss” which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that\ntheir continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely\nno recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off the asset even though partial\nrecovery may be achieved in the future.\nThe following table presents loans by class, net of deferred fees, by risk rating and period indicated as of December 31, 2023:\nRevolving\nRevolving Loans\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - As of December 31, 2023 Loans Converted\nAmortized to Term\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Cost Basis Loans Total\nCommercial and business\nPass $ 5,989 $ 5,066 $ 1,594 $ 810 $ 6 $ 939 $ 38,869 $ — $ 53,273\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 5,989 $ 5,066 $ 1,594 $ 810 $ 6 $ 939 $ 38,869 $ — $ 53,273\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nGovernment program\nPass $ — $ — $ — $ 8 $ — $ 66 $ — $ — $ 74\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ 8 $ — $ 66 $ — $ — $ 74\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate\nPass $ 40,929 $ 81,823 $ 52,019 $ 39,155 $ 60,626 $ 105,285 $ 501 $ — $ 380,338\nSpecial Mention — — — 5,796 — — — — 5,796\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 40,929 $ 81,823 $ 52,019 $ 44,951 $ 60,626 $ 105,285 $ 501 $ — $ 386,134\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nResidential mortgages\nNot graded $ — $ 24,835 $ 206,257 $ 2,260 $ — $ 8,969 $ — $ — $ 242,321\nPass 4,189 1,925 5,253 1,579 3,494 1,778 — — 18,218\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 4,189 $ 26,760 $ 211,510 $ 3,839 $ 3,494 $ 10,747 $ — $ — $ 260,539\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nHome improvement and home equity\nNot graded $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 32 $ — $ — $ 32\nPass — — — — — 4 — — 4\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 36 $ — $ — $ 36\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n66\nTable of Contents\nRevolving\nRevolving Loans\nLoans Converted\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - As of December 31, 2023\nAmortized to Term\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Cost Basis Loans Total\nReal estate construction and development\nPass $ 27,951 $ 9,571 $ — $ 31,308 $ — $ 3,978 $ 43,734 $ — $ 116,542\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — 3,524 — 7,878 — — 11,402\nTotal $ 27,951 $ 9,571 $ — $ 34,832 $ — $ 11,856 $ 43,734 $ — $ 127,944\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nAgricultural\nPass $ 2,086 $ 4,163 $ 457 $ 2,958 $ 1,592 $ 12,574 $ 22,556 $ — $ 46,386\nSpecial Mention — 2,105 — 513 — 356 — — 2,974\nSubstandard — — — — — 45 390 — 435\nTotal $ 2,086 $ 6,268 $ 457 $ 3,471 $ 1,592 $ 12,975 $ 22,946 $ — $ 49,795\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInstallment and student loans\nNot graded $ 708 $ 250 $ 142 $ 74 $ 483 $ 38,519 $ 472 $ — $ 40,648\nPass 1,173 — — — — — — — 1,173\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 426 — — 426\nTotal $ 1,881 $ 250 $ 142 $ 74 $ 483 $ 38,945 $ 472 $ — $ 42,247\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,588 $ — $ — $ 2,588\nTotal loans outstanding (risk rating):\nNot graded $ 708 $ 25,085 $ 206,399 $ 2,334 $ 483 $ 47,520 $ 472 $ — $ 283,001\nPass 82,317 102,548 59,323 75,818 65,718 124,624 105,660 — 616,008\nSpecial Mention — 2,105 — 6,309 — 356 — — 8,770\nSubstandard — — — 3,524 — 8,349 390 — 12,263\nGrand total loans $ 83,025 $ 129,738 $ 265,722 $ 87,985 $ 66,201 $ 180,849 $ 106,522 $ — $ 920,042\nTotal current period\ngross write-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,588 $ — $ — $ 2,588\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the credit risk ratings for commercial, construction, and other non-consumer related loans at\nDecember 31, 2022.

This loss\nmeasurement, which uses the current expected credit loss (CECL) cohort methodology analysis, relies on segmenting the loan\nportfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool\nloss experience. Management estimates the allowance for credit loss balance using relevant available information, from\ninternal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The\ncumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company’s historical loss experience\nfrom 2006 to 2023. The Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience a slight decline in economic\nconditions and an increase in unemployment rates and levels and trends of delinquencies over the next year. Management has\nadjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations.\nUnfunded loan commitment reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for\nunfunded loan commitments are included in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. Prior to\nadoption of ASC 326, provisions for unfunded loan commitments were included in other expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe following summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses by loan category for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 (in thousands).\nCommercial Real Estate Installment\nand Real Estate Construction & Student\nDecember 31, 2023 Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Loans Unallocated Total\nBeginning balance $ 955 $ 1,363 $ 3,409 $ 525 $ 2,898 $ 1,032 $ 10,182\nCECL adjustment 1,336 2,359 720 1,025 1,959 (1,032) 6,367\nProvision for (reversal of) credit\nlosses (1) (390) (1,253) (515) (300) 3,888 — 1,430\nCharge-offs — — — — (2,588) — (2,588)\nRecoveries 2 55 — — 210 — 267\nEnding balance $ 1,903 $ 2,524 $ 3,614 $ 1,250 $ 6,367 $ — $ 15,658\n(1) Excludes a $30,000 provision for unfunded loan commitments during the year.\nReal Estate\nCommercial Construction Installment\nand Real Estate and & Student\nDecember 31, 2022 Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Loans Unallocated Total\nBeginning balance $ 597 $ 1,174 $ 2,840 $ 1,233 $ 2,720 $ 769 $ 9,333\nProvision for (reversal of) credit\nlosses (1) 87 147 569 (744) 1,480 263 1,802\nCharge-offs 1 — — — (1,364) — (1,363)\nRecoveries 270 42 — 36 62 — 410\nEnding balance $ 955 $ 1,363 $ 3,409 $ 525 $ 2,898 $ 1,032 $ 10,182\n(1) Includes a $137,000 reversal of provision for unfunded loan commitments during the year.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans\nA loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to\nbe provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in collateral-dependent loans by type of loan:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Number of\nCollateral- Collateral-\nDependent Dependent\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Loans Amount Loans\nReal estate construction and development loans $ 11,390 3 $ 14,436 4\nAgricultural loans 390 1 108 2\nTotal $ 11,780 4 $ 14,544 6\nAt December 31, 2023, two of the real estate and construction and development loans were secured by land and one was\nsecured by a multifamily property, and the agricultural loan was secured by farmland. At December 31, 2022, three of the real\nestate and construction and development loans were secured by land and one was secured by a multifamily property, and the\nagricultural loan was secured by farmland.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, and undisbursed\nfunds on lines of credit. The Company evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments in the same\nmanner as it evaluates credit risk within the loan portfolio. The reserve for the unfunded loan commitments is a liability on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and is included in other liabilities.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents the impact to the unfunded commitments liability after the adoption of CECL:\n12/31/2023 12/31/2022\nBeginning Liability $ 532 $ 669\nCECL Day 1 Adjustment 273 —\nProvision (Reversal of Provision) 30 (137)\nEnding Liability $ 835 $ 532\nLoan Modifications\nOccasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension,\nand other-than-insignificant payment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of\nforgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit losses. There were no loan modifications at December 31, 2023.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, loan modifications were classified as troubled debt restructurings. When the Company\ngranted a concession to a borrower as part of a loan restructuring, the restructuring was accounted for as a troubled debt\nrestructuring (TDR). TDRs were reported as a component of impaired loans.\nA TDR was a type of restructuring in which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial\ndifficulties, granted a concession (either imposed by court order, law, or agreement between the borrower and the Bank) to the\nborrower that it would not otherwise have considered. Although the restructuring took different forms, the Company’s\nobjective was to maximize recovery of its investment by granting relief to the borrower.\nThere were no TDR modifications or defaults during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following tables summarizes all TDR activity by loan category for the years ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands).\nHome\nImprovement Real Estate Installment\nCommercial Commercial Residential and Home Construction and Student\n2022 and Industrial Real Estate Mortgages Equity Development Agricultural Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ — $ — $ 146 $ — $ 2,206 $ 242 $ — $ 2,594\nDefaults — — — — — — — —\nAdditions — — — — — — — —\nPrincipal reductions — — (6) — (330) (134) — (470)\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — —\nEnding balance $ — $ — $ 140 $ — $ 1,876 $ 108 $ — $ 2,124\nAllowance for loan loss $ — $ — $ 4 $ — $ — $ 48 $ — $ 52\nThe Company made various types of concessions when structuring TDRs including rate reductions, payment extensions, and\nforbearance. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 4 restructured loans totaling $2.1 million. The Company had no\nunfunded commitments outstanding for TDRs at December 31, 2022.\n4. Student Loans\nIncluded in installment loans are $38.5 million and $42.1 million in student loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022, made to\nmedical and pharmacy school students. Upon graduation the loan is automatically placed on deferment for six months. This\nmay be extended up to 48 months for graduates enrolling in internship, medical residency, or fellowship. As approved, the\nstudent may receive additional deferment for hardship or administrative reasons in the form of forbearance for a maximum of\n36 months throughout the life of the loan. Student loans have not been originated or purchased since 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses for the student loan portfolio was $6.3\nmillion and $2.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, student loans totaling $426,000 and\n$252,000 were included in the substandard category, respectively.\n70\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the credit quality indicators for outstanding student loans as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Principal Accrued Number of Principal Accrued\n(In thousands, except number of loans) Loans Amount Interest Loans Amount Interest\nSchool 44 $ 1,242 $ 734 70 $ 2,056 $ 908\nGrace 18 473 296 27 667 348\nRepayment 444 20,833 289 516 23,414 857\nDeferment 237 10,163 2,022 268 10,974 1,732\nForbearance 98 5,782 133 91 5,019 237\nTotal 841 $ 38,493 $ 3,474 972 $ 42,130 $ 4,082\nSchool - The time in which the borrower is still actively in school at least half time. No payments are expected during this\nstage, though the borrower may begin immediate payments.\nGrace - A six month period of time granted to the borrower immediately upon graduation, or withdrawal from school. Interest\ncontinues to accrue. Upon completion of the six month grace period the loan is transferred to repayment status. This status\nmay also represent a borrower activated to military duty during their time in school. The borrower must return to at least half-\ntime status within six-months of the active duty end-date in order to return to in-school status.\nRepayment - The time in which the borrower is no longer actively in school at least half time, and has not received an approved\ngrace, deferment, or forbearance. Regular payment is expected from these borrowers under an allotted payment plan.\nDeferment - May be granted up to 48 months for borrowers who have begun the repayment period on their loans but are (1)\nactively enrolled in an eligible school at least half time, or (2) are actively enrolled in an approved and verifiable medical\nresidency, internship, or fellowship program.\nForbearance - The period of time during which the borrower may postpone making principal and interest payments due to\nhardship or administrative reasons. Interest continues to accrue on loans during periods of authorized forbearance. If the\nborrower is delinquent at the time the forbearance is granted, accrued and unpaid interest from the date of delinquency, if any,\nwill be capitalized at the end of the forbearance period. The loan-term will not change and payments may be increased to allow\nthe loan to pay off in the required time frame. A forbearance that results in and insignificant payment delay is not considered a\nconcessionary change in terms, provided the borrower affirms the obligation. Forbearance is not an uncommon status\ndesignation; this designation is standard industry practice, and is consistent with a student’s migration to the medical\nprofession. However, additional risk is associated with this designation.\nStudent Loan Aging\nStudent loans are generally charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past\ndue. Accrued but unpaid interest related to charged off student loans is reversed and charged against interest income. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, $252,000 in accrued interest receivable was reversed due to charge-offs of $2.6 million within\nthe student loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $141,000 in accrued interest receivable was reversed due to\ncharge-offs of $1.3 million within the student loan portfolio.\nThe following tables summarize the student loan aging for loans in repayment and forbearance as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Principal Number of Principal\n(Dollars in thousands) Borrowers Amount Borrowers Amount\nCurrent or less than 31 days 221 $ 25,070 251 $ 26,993\n31 - 60 days 6 791 8 546\n61 - 90 days 2 328 5 642\nGreater than 90 days 3 426 4 252\nTotal 232 $ 26,615 268 $ 28,433\n71\nTable of Contents\n5.

Investment in Limited Partnership\nThe Bank owns a 2.22% interest in a limited partnership which provides private capital for small to mid-sized businesses used\nto finance later stage growth, strategic acquisitions, ownership transitions, and recapitalizations, or mezzanine capital. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total investment in this limited partnership was $3.2 million, and $2.8 million,\nrespectively. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. No income was received from the partnership during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $566,000 was recognized and reflected in non-\ninterest income on the consolidated statement of income. Remaining unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, totaled $800,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.\n7.

The rates paid on these deposits were similar to those customarily paid to the Bank’s customers in\nthe normal course of business.\nThere were no brokered deposits held at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n8. Short-term Borrowings/Other Borrowings\nThe Bank maintains lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank, and corespondent banks\nwhich may be drawn upon, as needed, to cover short-term financial obligations, or for investment or capital utilization\npurposes.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank’s outstanding and available credit lines for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nUnsecured credit lines:\nCredit limit $ 80,000 $ 120,000\nBalance outstanding 2,000 —\nFederal Home Loan Bank:\nCredit limit 128,935 2,151\nBalance outstanding 60,000 —\nCollateral pledged 232,144 2,307\nFederal Reserve Bank:\nCredit limit 463,501 435,599\nBalance outstanding — —\nCollateral pledged 608,045 590,427\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s available lines of credit totaled $672.4 million. All lines of credit are on an “as\navailable” basis and can be revoked by the grantor at any time. These lines of credit have interest rates that are generally tied to\nthe Federal Funds rate or are indexed to short-term U.S. Treasury rates or SOFR. FHLB advances are collateralized by the\nCompany’s stock in the FHLB and investment securities. At December 31, 2023, $230.1 million in loans and $2.1 million in\ninvestment securities were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances. Additionally, $604.0 million in loans and $4.1 million in\ninvestment securities were pledged at December 31, 2023 as collateral for advances with the Federal Reserve Bank.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s available lines of credit totaled $557.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, $2.3 million\nin investment securities at FHLB were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances. Additionally, $590.4 million in real-estate\nsecured loans were pledged at December 31, 2022, as collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank.\n73\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had secured borrowings of $60.0 million at FHLB with a maturity date of January 18,\n2024, and overnight unsecured borrowings of $2.0 million at PCBB. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding\nborrowing balances.\n9. Leases\nThe Company leases land and premises for its branch banking offices, administration facilities, and ITMs. The initial terms of\nthese leases expire at various dates through 2032. Under the provisions of most of these leases, the Company has the option to\nextend the leases beyond their original terms at rental rates adjusted for changes reported in certain economic indices or as\nreflected by market conditions. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain\nthe Company will exercise that option. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 13 operating leases and no financing\nleases.\nUpon adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases, the Bank chose to apply the incremental borrowing rate in its determination of the\nlease liability. The incremental borrowing rate approximates the Bank’s current rates for fully secured loans where the amount\nand terms applied are similar to the amount and terms of the lease.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows for the yeas ended:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating lease expense $ 711 $ 728\nShort-term lease expense — —\nVariable lease expense — —\nSublease income — —\nTotal lease cost $ 711 $ 728\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nOperating cash flows used in operating leases $ 720 $ 729\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ — $ —\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms in years for operating leases 4.23 4.49\nWeighted-average discount rate for operating leases 5.09 % 5.12 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nLease\nYears Ending December 31, Liabilities\n2024 $ 580\n2025 402\n2026 183\n2027 112\n2028 108\nThereafter 211\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 1,596\nLess: present value discount (159)\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments $ 1,437\n74\nTable of Contents\n10. Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities\nThe contractual principal balance of the Company’s debentures relating to its trust preferred securities is $12 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at any time at par.\nThe Company accounts for its junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II at fair value. The Company\nbelieves the election of fair value accounting for the junior subordinated debentures better reflects the true economic value of\nthe debt instrument on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2023, the rate paid on the junior subordinated debt\nissued under USB Capital Trust II is 3-month SOFR plus 129 basis points, and is adjusted quarterly.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company performed a fair value measurement analysis on its junior subordinated debt using a cash\nflow model approach to determine the present value of those cash flows. The cash flow model utilizes the forward 3-month\nSOFR curve to estimate future quarterly interest payments due over remaining life of the debt instrument. These cash flows\nare discounted at a rate which incorporates a current market rate for similar-term debt instruments, adjusted for additional\ncredit and liquidity risks associated with junior subordinated debt. The 6.14% discount rate used represents what a market\nparticipant would consider under the circumstances based on current market assumptions. At December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt was $1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nNet fair value calculation (loss) gain $ (270) $ 413\nOther comprehensive income (loss) gain (544) 2,947\nRecognized gain (loss) on fair value 274 (2,533)\nCumulative gain recorded 1,461 1,732\nDiscount rate 6.14 % 6.63 %\nThe net fair value calculation performed as of December 31, 2023 resulted in a pretax loss adjustment of $270,000 for the year\nended December 31, 2023, compared to a pretax gain adjustment of $413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $270,000 fair value loss adjustment was separately presented as a $274,000 gain\nrecognized on the consolidated statements of income, and a $544,000 loss associated with the instrument-specific credit risk\nrecognized in other comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the $413,000 fair value gain adjustment\nwas separately presented as a $2.5 million loss recognized on the consolidated statements of income, and a $2.9 million gain\nassociated with the instrument-specific credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income.

Under the guidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement\nbenefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination. The\nterm “more likely than not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not\ncriterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority and all\navailable information is known to the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has no uncertain tax\npositions.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S federal jurisdiction and California. There are no filings in\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before 2020\nand 2019 for Federal and California jurisdictions, respectively.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Interest\nand penalties recognized during the periods ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were insignificant.\n12. Stock Based Compensation\nOptions and restricted stock units and awards have been granted to directors, officers and key employees at an exercise price\nequal to estimated fair value at the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. All options, units, and awards granted\nare service awards, and are based solely upon fulfilling a requisite service period (the vesting period). At December 31, 2023,\nthe Company had one shareholder approved stock based compensation plan.\nIn May 2015, the Company adopted the United Security Bancshares 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (2015 Plan). The 2015\nPlan provides for the granting of up to 758,000 shares of authorized and unissued shares of common stock in the form of stock\noptions, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. The 2015 Plan requires that the exercise price may not be less than\nthe fair value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the option price must be paid in-full at the time it is\nexercised.\nThe options granted (incentive stock options for employees and non-qualified stock options for Directors) have an exercise\nprice at the prevailing market price on the date of grant. All options granted are exercisable 20% each year commencing one\nyear after the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. Restricted stock units are granted at the prevailing market\nprice of the Company’s stock, subject to time-based vesting. Restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if employment\nterminates prior to vesting. The cost of these awards is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value\nof the common stock on the date of the grant.\nUnder the 2015 Plan, 96,435 granted stock instruments are outstanding as of December 31, 2023, of which 51,000 are\nexercisable. Of the 96,435 granted stock instruments, 7,000 are restricted stock units, 14,435 are restricted stock awards, and\n75,000 are nonqualified stock options.\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 411,590 shares available for future issuance under equity compensation plans.\n77\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plan and changes during the year are presented below:\nWeighted\nAverage\nWeighted Remaining Aggregate\nAverage Contractual Intrinsic\nShares Exercise Price Term (Years) Value\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2021 94,601 $ 7.87\nGranted during the year 30,000 8.17\nExercised during the year (5,579) 5.22\nForfeited during the year — —\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2022 119,022 8.07 4.78 $ 105,334\nGranted during the year — —\nExercised during the year (29,022) 3.68\nForfeited during the year (15,000) 9.25\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2023 75,000 $ 9.54 5.50 $ 7,200\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022 there was $78,000 and $104,000, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense\nrelated to non-vested stock options.

Director’s fees totaling $337,000 and $181,000 for the same periods, respectively, are\nalso included in stock-based compensation as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. The\nrelated tax benefit on share-based compensation recorded in the provision for income taxes was not material to any year.\nA summary of the status of the Company’s stock option values and activity is presented below:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nWeighted average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted $ — $ 127,644\nWeighted average fair value of stock options vested $ 26,000 $ 86,000\nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 85,000 $ 10,555\nThe Bank determines fair value of stock options at grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model that takes into\naccount the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock\nand the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate over the expected life of the option. The Bank determines fair\nvalue of restricted stock based on the quoted stock price as of the grant date.\nThe expected term of options granted is derived from management’s experience, which is based upon historical data on\nemployee exercise and post-vesting behavior. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on\nthe U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the\nBank’s stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the options. The Company believes that historical\nvolatility is indicative of expectations about its future volatility over the expected term of the options. The Bank expenses the\nfair value of the option on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for each separate service period portion of the award.\nThe fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of the grant date:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate — % 1.23 %\nExpected term in years 0 10\nExpected stock price volatility — % 41.63 %\nDividend yield — —\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected\nlife of the stock based award and stock price volatility. The assumptions listed above represent management’s best estimates,\nbut these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if other\nassumptions had been used, the Bank’s recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been materially different from\nthat previously reported in proforma disclosures.\n13. Employee Benefit Plans\n401K Plan\nThe Company has a Cash or Deferred 401(k) Stock Ownership Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) organized under Section 401(k) of the\nCode. All employees of the Company are initially eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan upon the first day of the month after\ndate of hire. Under the terms of the plan, the participants may elect to make contributions to the 401(k) Plan as determined by\nthe Board of Directors. Participants are automatically vested 100% in all employee contributions. Participants may direct the\ninvestment of their contributions to the 401(k) Plan in any of several authorized investment vehicles. The Company contributes\n79\nTable of Contents\nfunds to the Plan up to 4% of the employees’ eligible annual compensation. Company contributions are immediately 100%\nvested at the time of contribution. The Company made matching contributions of $282,000 and $263,000 to the 401(k) Plan for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSalary Continuation Plan\nThe Company has an unfunded, non-qualified Salary Continuation Plan for senior executive officers and certain other key\nofficers of the Company, which provides additional compensation benefits upon retirement for a period of at least 15 years.\nFuture compensation under the Plan is earned by the employees for services rendered through retirement and vests over a\nperiod of 12 to 32 years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company maintained a total of twelve Salary Continuation agreements.\nThe Company’s current benefit liability is determined based upon vesting and the present value of the benefits at a\ncorresponding discount rate. The discount rate used is an equivalent rate for high-quality investment-grade bonds with lives\nmatching those of the service periods remaining for the salary continuation contracts, which averages approximately 20 years.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, $4,255,000 and $4,245,000, respectively, had been accrued to date, based on a discounted\ncash flow using an average discount rate of 5.30% and 4.83%, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. Salary continuation expense is included in salaries and benefits expense, and totaled $314,000 and\n$310,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded within the twelve total Salary Continuation agreements, the Company has four separate agreements with officers of\nthe Bank and accrues for this salary continuation liability based on anticipated years of service and vesting schedules provided\nunder the individual agreements. The four policies are considered individual contracts, and the Company applies guidance\ncontained in ASC Topic 710. Additionally, the Company purchased company owned life insurance (COLI) and bank owned\nlife insurance policies (BOLI) on the life of the officers in connection with the salary continuation agreements. The COLI\npolicy premiums were paid over a seven year period and the BOLI policy premiums were paid in whole upon purchase of the\npolicies. There was no premium expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nFor the other eight Salary Continuation agreements in place prior to 2015, the Company recognizes in accumulated other\ncomprehensive (loss) income, the amounts that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs, per\nthe guidance contained in ASC Topic 715 “Compensation”. These unrecognized costs arise from changes in estimated interest\nrates used in the calculation of net liabilities under the Plan. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had\napproximately $130,000 and $195,000, respectively in unrecognized net periodic benefit costs arising from changes in interest\nrates used in calculating the current post-retirement liability required under the Plan. This amount represents the difference\nbetween the plan liabilities calculated under net present value calculations, and the net plan liabilities actually recorded on the\nCompany’s books at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOfficer Supplemental Life Insurance Plan\nThe Company owns Bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI) and Company-owned life insurance policies (COLI) on certain\nofficers, including those covered under the Salary Continuation Plan above, with a portion of the post-retirement benefit\navailable to the officers’ beneficiaries. The BOLI and COLI initial net cash surrender value is equal to the premium paid. Non-\ntaxable increases in the cash surrender value, net of the cost of insurance, plus any death benefits ultimately received by the\nCompany, are recorded as income. The cash surrender value of the policies totaled $22.0 million and $22.9 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and are included on the consolidated balance sheet as cash surrender value of life insurance.\nIncome, net of expense, totaled $557,000 and $555,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As the\nSalary Continuation Plan remains unfunded, it is the Company’s intention to utilize the policy proceeds to settle Plan\nobligations. Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the life insurance policies are the property of the Company and are\navailable, if necessary, to satisfy the Company’s creditors.\n14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk: The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk\nwhich arise in the normal course of business. These instruments may contain elements of credit risk, interest rate risk and\nliquidity risk, and include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. The credit risk associated with these\ninstruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to customers and is represented by the contractual\namount indicated in the table below:\n80\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCommitments to extend credit $ 183,537 $ 190,183\nStandby letters of credit 2,940 1,570\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established\nin the contract. Substantially all of these commitments are at floating interest rates based on the prime rate, and most have fixed\nexpiration dates. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of\ncollateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies but includes\naccounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing properties.\nMany of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, as a result, the total commitment amounts do\nnot necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to\na third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to\ncustomers. The Company’s letters of credit are short-term guarantees and generally have terms from less than one month to\napproximately 3 years. At December 31, 2023, the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments the Company\ncould be required to make under outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $2.9 million.\nRemaining unfunded commitments for the investment in limited partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled\n$800,000 and $1.2 million, respectively.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in litigation arising out of its normal business activities.\nManagement, after consultation with legal counsel, believes that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from the disposition of\nsuch claims would not be material to the financial position of the Company.\n15. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\nThe following summary disclosures are made in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC Topic 825 “Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures” which requires the disclosure of fair value information for both on- and off-balance sheet\nfinancial instruments where it is practicable to estimate that value.\nGAAP guidance clarifies the definition of fair value, describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles and expands fair value disclosure requirements. This guidance applies whenever\nother accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\n• Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (as defined) for identical assets or liabilities that the\nreporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and reflect the reporting entity’s assumptions regarding\nthe pricing of an asset or liability by a market participant (including assumptions about risk).\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy within\nwhich the fair value measurements are categorized at the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices Significant\nIn Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Estimated Identical Inputs Level Inputs Level\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value Assets Level 1 2 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 181,266 $ 179,016 $ 12,438 $ 166,578 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 3,354 — —\nLoans, net 904,384 871,681 — — 871,681\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 71,848 71,414 — — 71,414\nShort-term borrowings 62,000 62,000 62,000 — —\nJunior subordinated debt 11,213 11,213 — — 11,213\nDecember 31, 2022\nQuoted Prices Significant\nIn Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Estimated Identical Inputs Level Inputs Level\n(In thousands) Amount Fair Value Assets Level 1 2 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 207,545 $ 207,545 $ 29,224 $ 178,321 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,315 3,315 3,315 — —\nLoans, net 969,996 906,050 — — 906,050\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 58,048 57,056 — — 57,056\nJunior subordinated debt 10,883 10,883 — — 10,883\nThe Company performs fair value measurements on certain assets and liabilities as the result of the application of current\naccounting guidelines. Some fair value measurements, such as investment securities and junior subordinated debt are\nperformed on a recurring basis, while others, such as impairment of loans, other real estate owned, goodwill and other\nintangibles, are performed on a nonrecurring basis.\n• Level 1 financial assets consist of money market funds and highly liquid mutual funds for which fair values are based\non quoted market prices.\n• Level 2 financial assets include highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. Government agencies, collateralized mortgage\nobligations, corporate debt instruments, and debt obligations of states and political subdivisions, whose fair values are\nobtained from readily-available pricing sources for the identical or similar underlying security that may, or may not, be\nactively traded.\n• Level 3 financial assets include certain instruments where the assumptions may be made by the Company or third\nparties about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between Level 1, 2, and 3 when a change in circumstances warrants a transfer. There were\nno transfers in or out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value\non a recurring and non-recurring basis:\nInvestment Securities - Available-for-sale and marketable equity security values are based on open-market price quotes\nobtained from reputable third-party brokers. Market pricing is based upon specific CUSIP identification for each individual\nsecurity. To the extent there are observable prices in the market, the mid-point of the bid/ask price is used to determine the fair\nvalue of individual securities. If that data is not available for the last 30 days, a Level 2-type matrix pricing-approach, based on\n82\nTable of Contents\ncomparable securities in the market, is utilized. Level 2 pricing may include the use of a forward spread from the last\nobservable trade or may use a proxy bond, such as a TBA mortgage, to determine the price for the security being valued.\nChanges in fair market value are recorded through other-accumulated-comprehensive-income as an unrecognized gain or loss\non fair value.\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans - Fair value measurements for individually-evaluated loans are performed pursuant to\nauthoritative accounting guidance and are based upon either collateral values supported by third party appraisals or observed\nmarket prices. Collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral. There were no\nindividually-evaluated loans measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as\nother real estate owned (OREO) are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are\ngenerally based on third party appraisals of the property, resulting in a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying\namount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. No OREO properties were measured at fair\nvalue as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nJunior Subordinated Debt - The fair value of the junior subordinated debt is based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing\nobservable market rates and credit characteristics for similar debt instruments. In its analysis, the Company uses characteristics\nthat market participants would generally use, and considers factors specific to the liability and the principal, or most\nadvantageous, market for the liability. Cash flows are discounted at a rate which incorporates a current market rate for similar-\nterm debt instruments, adjusted for credit and liquidity risks associated with similar junior subordinated debt and circumstances\nunique to the Company. The Company believes that the subjective nature of these inputs, credit concerns in the capital markets,\nand inactivity in the trust preferred markets, limit the observability of market spreads, requiring the junior subordinated debt to\nbe classified at a Level 3 fair value.\nThe following table provides a description of the valuation technique, unobservable input, and qualitative information about the\nunobservable inputs for the Company’s liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a recurring basis at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFinancial Valuation Unobservable Weighted Financial Valuation Unobservable Weighted\nInstrument Technique Input Average Instrument Technique Input Average\nJunior Discounted Market credit 6.14% Junior Discounted Market credit 6.63%\nSubordinated cash flow risk adjusted Subordinated cash flow risk adjusted\nDebt spreads Debt spreads\nManagement believes that the credit risk-adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated\ndebentures is indicative of the nonperformance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current, inactive\nmarket conditions. Management attributes the change in fair value of the junior subordinated debentures to market changes in\nthe nonperformance expectations and pricing of this type of debt. Generally, an increase in the credit risk adjusted spread and/\nor a decrease in the forward three-month SOFR curve will result in a positive fair value adjustment and a decrease in the fair\nvalue measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and/or an increase in the forward three-month\nSOFR curve will result in a negative fair value adjustment and an increase in the fair value measurement. The decrease in\ndiscount rate between the periods ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, is primarily due to decreases in rates for\nsimilar debt instruments.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023:\nQuoted\nPrices in\nActive Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 6,156 $ — $ 6,156 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 88,184 — 88,184 —\nMunicipal bonds 40,116 — 40,116 —\nU.S. Treasury securities 12,438 — 12,438 —\nCorporate bonds 32,122 — 32,122 —\nTotal AFS securities 179,016 — 179,016 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 — —\nTotal assets $ 182,370 $ 3,354 $ 179,016 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nTotal liabilities $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nThere were no non-recurring fair value adjustments at December 31, 2023.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022:\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 8,231 $ — $ 8,231 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 97,218 — 97,218 —\nMunicipal bonds 40,170 — 40,170 —\nU.S. Treasury securities 29,224 — 29,224 —\nCorporate bonds 32,702 — 32,702 —\nTotal AFS securities 207,545 — 207,545 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,315 3,315 — —\nTotal assets $ 210,860 $ 3,315 $ 207,545 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 10,883 $ — $ — $ 10,883\nTotal liabilities $ 10,883 $ — $ — $ 10,883\nThe were no non-recurring fair value adjustments at December 31, 2022.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of liabilities at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on a\nrecurring basis during the years ended:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nJunior Subordinated Debt (in thousands) 2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 10,883 $ 11,189\nTotal (gains) losses included in earnings (274) 2,533\nTotal gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income 544 (2,947)\nCapitalized interest 60 108\nEnding balance $ 11,213 $ 10,883\nThe amount of total (gains) losses for the period included in earnings attributable to the change\nin unrealized gains or losses relating to liabilities still held at the reporting date $ (274) $ 2,533\n16.

Regulatory Matters\nCapital Adequacy\nThe Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and\npossible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework, the consolidated Company\nand the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain off-\nbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject\nto qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action\nprovisions are not applicable to bank holding companies.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules, a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, includes quantitative measures\ndesigned to ensure capital adequacy. The Basel III Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain:\n• (i) a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50 percent plus a 2.50 percent “capital conservation buffer,”\n• (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00 percent plus the capital conservation buffer,\n• (iii) total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00 percent plus the capital conservation buffer and,\n• (iv) Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00 percent.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the\nminimum required risk-weighted capital ratios. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by\nregulators that could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio: The federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a\nsimplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking\norganization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio framework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than nine\npercent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio requirements for the well capitalized\ncategory under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the qualifying\nbanking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than nine\npercent may opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework if it has average consolidated total assets of less than\n$10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading\nliabilities of five percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an advance approaches banking\norganization.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe final rule became effective January 1, 2020, and was adopted by the Bank on September 30, 2020. As of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company and Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.\nThe following table shows the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios at December 31,\n2023 and 2022 as compared to the applicable capital adequacy guidelines:\nMinimum requirement for\nCommunity Bank Leverage\nActual Ratio (1)\n(In thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2023 (Company):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) $147,350 11.82% $112,035 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2023 (Bank):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 147,249 11.83% $112,152 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2022 (Company):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 135,889 10.10% $121,064 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2022 (Bank):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 135,930 10.11% $120,968 9.00%\n(1) If the subsidiary bank’s leverage ratio exceeds the minimum ratio under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework, it is deemed\nto be “well capitalized” under all other regulatory capital requirements. The Company may revert back to the regulatory framework for\n“Prompt Corrective Action” if the subsidiary bank’s leverage ratio falls below the minimum under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio\nFramework.\n22. Related Party Transactions\nDuring 2022, a member of the Board of Directors was hired to act as Chief Information Officer (CIO) on an interim basis, for\nwhich the director was paid a consulting fee of $200,000. As a result, the director is currently not considered an independent\ndirector.\n23. Subsequent Events\nSubsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.\nRecognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the\ndate of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. Nonrecognized\nsubsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose\nafter that date. Management has reviewed events occurring through the date the financial statements were issued and no\nsubsequent events occurred requiring accrual or disclosure.\nItem 9 - Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nCONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial\nOfficer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of\nDecember 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s management has determined that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company\nin the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls\nand procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nby the Company in the reports that it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President\nand Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\n89\nTable of Contents\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission as of December 31, 2023.\nBased on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of\n2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting.\nItem 9B.

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThese unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim\nfinancial information on a basis consistent with the accounting policies reflected in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in its\n2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These interim consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for\ncomplete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of a normal, recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair\npresentation have been included. Operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any\nother interim period or for the year as a whole.\nReclassifications:\nSome items in the prior year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Reclassifications had no effect on prior period net\nincome or shareholders’ equity.\n2.

Actual maturities may differ\nfrom contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

At September 30, 2024, the decline in fair value of the available-for-sale securities\nis attributed to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. These declines are primarily the result of the fast pace and large increases in interest rates during\nthe last two years, which have led to decreases in bond prices and increases in yields. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and because\nit is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company did not consider it necessary to\nprovide an allowance for any available-for-sale security at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized unrealized gains of $270,000 and unrealized losses of $99,000,\nrespectively, related to one mutual fund included in marketable equity securities. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company\nrecognized unrealized gains of $224,000 and unrealized losses of $92,000, respectively, related to the same mutual fund.\nThe Company had no held-to-maturity or trading securities at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\n3.

The Company’s residential mortgage loans and participation loans with other financial institutions are primarily within\nthe state of California.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCommercial and industrial loans are generally made to support the ongoing operations of small- to medium-sized commercial businesses. Commercial and\nindustrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification and provide working capital, financing for the purchase of equipment, funding for growth, or\ngeneral expansion of businesses. A substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable, inventory, leases, or other\ncollateral including real estate; the remainder are unsecured. Extensions of credit are predicated upon the financial capacity of the borrower and repayment is\ngenerally from the cash flow of the borrower.\nReal estate mortgage loans are typically secured by either trust deeds on commercial property or single-family residences. Repayment of real estate mortgage\nloans generally comes from the cash flow of the borrower and or guarantor(s).\n• Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise the largest segment of this loan category and are available for both income-producing and non-\nincome-producing commercial properties, including office buildings, shopping centers, apartments and motels, owner-occupied buildings,\nmanufacturing facilities, and more. Commercial real estate mortgage loans can also be used to refinance existing debt. These loans are typically\nrepaid from the borrower’s business operations, rental income associated with the real property, or personal assets.\n• Residential mortgage loans are provided to individuals to finance or refinance single-family residences. Residential mortgages are not a primary\nbusiness line offered by the Company, and a majority are conventional mortgages that were purchased as a pool.\n• Home improvement and home equity loans comprise a relatively small portion of total real estate mortgage loans. Home equity loans are\ngenerally secured by junior trust deeds, but may be secured by 1st trust deeds.\nReal estate construction and development loans consist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as land acquisition and\ndevelopment, and land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate, including improved- and unimproved-land, as well as\nsingle-family residential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity\nrequirements. Repayment of construction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project\nor from the sale of the constructed homes to individuals.\nAgricultural loans are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory, and receivables. Repayment is from the cash flow of the borrower.\nInstallment loans generally consist of student loans; loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures; automobiles; or other\nconsumer items. See “Note 4 - Student Loans” for specific information on the student loan portfolio.\nOff-Balance Sheet Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit of $131.9 million and $183.5 million,\nrespectively, and standby letters of credit of $12.8 million and $2.9 million for the same period ends, respectively. These instruments involve elements of credit\nrisk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Company’s\ninvolvement in off-balance sheet financial instruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual\namounts of those instruments. The Company applies the same credit policies used for on-balance sheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit continue as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the customer’s contract. Substantially all of these\ncommitments are at floating interest rates based on the prime rate and generally have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis and requires collateral in some cases. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, leases,\nproperty, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing properties.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\n11\nTable of Contents\nPast Due Loans\nThe following is a summary of the amortized cost of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees and costs, at September 30, 2024:\nAccruing\nLoans Loans Loans Loans 90 or\n30-60 Days 61-89 Days 90 or More Total Past Due More Days Past\n(In thousands) Past Due Past Due Days Past Due Loans Current Loans Total Loans Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 56,621 $ 56,621 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 65 65 —\nTotal commercial and industrial — — — — 56,686 56,686 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 439,187 439,187 —\nResidential mortgages — 130 — 130 248,565 248,695 —\nHome improvement and home equity\nloans — — — — 26 26 —\nTotal real estate mortgage — 130 — 130 687,778 687,908 —\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans — — 11,982 11,982 111,642 123,624 —\nAgricultural loans — — 7 7 66,540 66,547 —\nInstallment and student loans 1,527 1,014 794 3,335 37,051 40,386 794\nTotal loans $ 1,527 $ 1,144 $ 12,783 $ 15,454 $ 959,697 $ 975,151 $ 794\nThe following is a summary of the amortized cost of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees and costs, at December 31, 2023:\nAccruing\nLoans Loans Loans Loans 90 or\n30-60 Days 61-89 Days 90 or More Total Past Due More Days Past\n(In thousands) Past Due Past Due Days Past Due Loans Current Loans Total Loans Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 53,273 $ 53,273 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 74 74 —\nTotal commercial and industrial — — — — 53,347 53,347 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 386,134 386,134 —\nResidential mortgages — — — — 260,539 260,539 —\nHome improvement and home equity\nloans — — — — 36 36 —\nTotal real estate mortgage — — — — 646,709 646,709 —\nReal estate construction and development\nloans — — 11,390 11,390 116,554 127,944 —\nAgricultural loans — — 45 45 49,750 49,795 —\nInstallment and student loans 791 328 426 1,545 40,702 42,247 426\nTotal loans $ 791 $ 328 $ 11,861 $ 12,980 $ 907,062 $ 920,042 $ 426\nNonaccrual Loans\nLoans are placed on nonaccrual status under the following circumstances:\n- When there is doubt regarding the full repayment of interest and principal.\n- When principal and/or interest on the loan has been in default for 90 days or more, unless the asset is both well-secured and in the process of collection\nthat will result in repayment in the near future.\n- When the loan is identified as having loss elements and/or is risk rated grade 8 (doubtful).\n12\nTable of Contents\nLoans on nonaccrual status are usually returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current, when there is no\nidentified element of loss, and when current and continued satisfactory performance is expected. Return to accrual status is generally warranted through the\ntimely receipt of at least six monthly payments on a loan with monthly amortization. There was no interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and 2023.\nThere were no remaining undisbursed commitments to extend credit on nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans on nonaccrual status and accruing loans more than 90 days past due:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNonaccrual Loans Nonaccrual Loans\nWith No Accruing Loans With No Accruing Loans\nAllowance For Total Nonaccrual 90 or More Days Allowance For Total Nonaccrual 90 or More Days\n(In thousands) Credit Losses Loans Past Due Credit Losses Loans Past Due\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans 11,995 11,995 — 11,403 11,403 —\nAgricultural loans 7 7 — — 45 —\nInstallment and student loans — — 794 — — 426\nTotal $ 12,002 $ 12,002 $ 794 $ 11,403 $ 11,448 $ 426\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of its credit monitoring program, the Company utilizes a risk rating system to quantify the risk the Company estimates it has assumed during the life of\na loan. This system rates the strength of the borrower and the facility or transaction, and is designed to provide a program for risk management and early\ndetection of problems.\nFor each new credit approval, credit extension, renewal, or modification of existing credit facilities, the Company assigns risk ratings utilizing the rating scale\nidentified in this policy. In addition, on an ongoing basis, loans and credit facilities are reviewed for internal and external influences impacting the credit\nfacility that would warrant a change in the risk rating. Each credit facility is given a risk rating that takes into account factors that materially affect credit\nquality.\nWhen assigning risk ratings, the Company evaluates two risk-rating approaches; a facility rating and a borrower rating.\nFacility Rating:\nThe facility rating is determined by the analysis of positive and negative factors that may indicate that the quality of a particular loan or credit arrangement\nrequires a different risk rating than that assigned to the borrower. The Company assesses the risk impact of these factors:\nCollateral - The rating may be affected by the type and quality of the collateral, the degree of coverage, the economic life of the collateral, the liquidation value,\nand the Company's ability to dispose of the collateral.\nGuarantees - The value of third-party support arrangements varies widely. Unconditional guarantees from persons with demonstrable ability to perform are\nmore substantial than that of persons closely-related to the borrower who offer only modest support.\nUnusual Terms - Credit may be extended on terms that subject the Company to a higher level of risk than indicated in the rating of the borrower.\nBorrower Rating:\nThe borrower rating is a measure of loss possibility based on the historical, current, and anticipated financial characteristics of the borrower in the current risk\nenvironment. To determine the rating, the Company considers the following factors:\n13\nTable of Contents\n- Quality of management\n- Liquidity\n- Leverage/capitalization\n- Profit margins/earnings trend\n- Adequacy of financial records\n- Alternative funding sources\n- Geographic risk\n- Industry risk\n- Cash flow risk\n- Accounting practices\n- Asset protection\n- Extraordinary risks\nThe Company assigns risk ratings to loans, other than consumer loans and other homogeneous loan pools, based on the following scale. Consumer loans and\nother homogenous pools do not receive a risk rating at inception unless a loan becomes delinquent or exhibits other significant risk factors. The risk ratings are\nused when determining borrower ratings as well as facility ratings. The Company uses the following risk rating grades:\nPass Ratings:\n- Grades 1 and 2 – These grades include loans to high-quality borrowers with high credit quality and sound financial strength. Key financial ratios are\ngenerally above industry averages and the borrower has a strong earnings history or net worth. These may be secured by deposit accounts or high-\ngrade investment securities.\n- Grade 3 – This grade includes loans to borrowers with solid credit quality and minimal risk. The borrower’s balance sheet and financial ratios are\ngenerally in line with industry averages, and the borrower has historically demonstrated the ability to manage economic adversity. Real estate and\nasset-based loans assigned this risk rating must have characteristics that place them well above the minimum underwriting requirements for those\ndepartments. Asset-based borrowers assigned this rating must exhibit extremely favorable leverage and cash flow characteristics and consistently\ndemonstrate a high level of unused borrowing capacity.\n- Grades 4 and 5 – These include pass-grade loans to borrowers of acceptable credit quality and risk. The borrower’s balance sheet and financial ratios\nmay be below industry averages but above the lowest industry quartile. Leverage is above and liquidity is below industry averages. Inadequacies\nevident in financial performance and/or management sufficiency are offset by readily available features of support, such as adequate collateral, or\ngood guarantors having the liquid assets and/or cash flow capacity to repay the debt. Although the borrower may have recognized a loss over three or\nfour years, recent earnings trends, while perhaps somewhat cyclical, are improving, and cash flows are adequate to cover debt service and fixed\nobligations. Real estate and asset borrowers who fully comply with all underwriting standards and are performing according to projections are\nassigned this rating. These also include grade 5 loans which are leveraged or on management’s watch list. While still considered pass loans, the\nborrower’s financial condition, cash flow, or operations evidence more than average risk and short-term weaknesses. These loans warrant a higher-\nthan-average level of monitoring, supervision, and attention from the Company, but do not reflect credit weakness trends that weaken or inadequately\nprotect the Company’s credit position. Loans with a grade 5 rating are not normally acceptable as new credits unless they are adequately secured or\ncarry substantial endorser/guarantors.\nSpecial Mention Rating:\n- Grade 6 – This grade includes loans that are currently protected but potentially weak. This is generally an interim classification and these loans will\ntypically be upgraded to an acceptable rating or downgraded to a substandard rating within a reasonable time period. Weaknesses in special mention\nloans may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the Company’s credit position at some future date. Special mention\nloans are often loans with weaknesses inherent in the loan origination and loan servicing, and may have some technical deficiencies. This designation\nindicates a distinct probability that the classification will deteriorate to a more adverse class if the noted deficiencies are not addressed by the loan\nofficer or loan management.\nSubstandard Rating:\n- Grade 7 – This grade includes substandard loans that are inadequately supported by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or\nthe collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness, or\n14\nTable of Contents\nweaknesses, that may impair the regular liquidation of the debt. When a loan has been downgraded to substandard, there exists a distinct possibility\nthat the Company will sustain a loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nDoubtful Ratings:\n- Grade 8 – This grade includes doubtful loans that exhibit the same characteristics as substandard loans. Loan weaknesses make collection or liquidation\nin full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high but, due\nto pending factors that may work toward the strengthening of the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may\nbe determined. Pending factors include a proposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional\ncollateral, and refinancing plans.\n- Grade 9 – This grade includes loans classified as loss which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable\nassets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable\nto defer writing off the asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents loans by class, at amortized cost (net of unearned fees and costs), by risk rating, and period indicated as of or for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024:\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year -

This loss measurement, which uses the\ncurrent expected credit loss (CECL) cohort methodology analysis, relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the\nperformance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Management estimates the allowance for credit loss balance using\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The\ncumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company’s historical loss experience from 2006 to the most recent\nquarter. The Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience a slight decline in economic conditions and an increase in unemployment\nrates and levels and trends of delinquencies over the next two years. Management has adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations.\nThe Company analyzes risk characteristics inherent in each loan portfolio segment as part of the quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans. The following summarizes some of the key risk characteristics for the ten segments of the loan portfolio:\n19\nTable of Contents\nCommercial and industrial loans – Commercial loans are subject to the effects of economic cycles and tend to exhibit increased risk as economic conditions\ndeteriorate or economic downturns are prolonged. The Company considers this segment to be one of higher risk given the size of individual loans and the\nbalances in the overall portfolio.\nGovernment program loans – This is a relatively small part of the Company’s loan portfolio but has historically had a high percentage of loans that have\nmigrated from pass to substandard given their vulnerability to economic cycles.\nCommercial real estate loans – This segment is considered to have more risk due to the vulnerability of commercial businesses to economic cycles as well as\ntheir exposure to fluctuations in real estate prices. Losses in this segment have been historically low because most loans are real estate-secured, and the Bank\nmaintains appropriate loan-to-value ratios.\nResidential mortgages – This segment is considered to have low risk factors based on the past experience of both the Company and peers. Loans in this\ncategory are secured by first deeds of trust.\nHome improvement and home equity loans – Because of their junior lien position, these loans have an inherently higher risk level.\nReal estate construction and development loans – This segment of loans is considered to have a higher risk profile due to construction issues and market value\nfluctuations in conjunction with normal credit risks.\nAgricultural loans – This segment is considered to have risks associated with weather, insects, marketing issues, commodity prices, land valuation, water\navailability, fertilizer costs, and crop concentration. Additionally, California may experience severe droughts, which can significantly harm the business of\ncustomers and the credit quality of the loans to those customers. Water resources and related issues affecting customers are closely monitored. Signs of\ndeterioration within this loan portfolio are closely monitored to manage credit quality and promote early efforts to work with borrowers to mitigate any\npotential losses.\nInstallment, overdrafts, and overdraft protection lines – This segment is at higher risk because most of the loans are unsecured. Additionally, in the case of\nstudent loans, there are increased risks associated with liquidity as there is a significant time lag between funding a student loan and eventual repayment.\nThe following summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses by loan category:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction Installment and\n(In thousands) Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ 2,113 $ 2,743 $ 2,397 $ 1,181 $ 6,889 $ 15,323\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses (1) 393 (143) 423 539 621 1,833\nCharge-offs — — — — (658) (658)\nRecoveries — 1 — — 24 25\nEnding balance $ 2,506 $ 2,601 $ 2,820 $ 1,720 $ 6,876 $ 16,523\n(1) There was also a reversal of provision of $270,000 for unfunded loan commitments and a provision for overdrafts of $5,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction Installment and\n(In thousands) Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ 2,007 $ 3,731 $ 3,513 $ 1,504 $ 5,355 $ 16,110\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses (1) (202) (932) 164 63 907 —\nCharge-offs — — — — (603) (603)\nRecoveries — 2 — — 140 142\nEnding balance $ 1,805 $ 2,801 $ 3,677 $ 1,567 $ 5,799 $ 15,649\n(1) There was no provision for unfunded loan commitments during the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n20\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction Installment and\n(In thousands) Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ 1,903 $ 2,524 $ 3,614 $ 1,250 $ 6,367 $ 15,658\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses (1) 602 72 (794) 470 1,790 2,140\nCharge-offs — — — — (1,471) (1,471)\nRecoveries 1 5 — — 190 196\nEnding balance $ 2,506 $ 2,601 $ 2,820 $ 1,720 $ 6,876 $ 16,523\n(1) There was also a reversal of provision of $373,000 for unfunded loan commitments and a provision for overdrafts of $17,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction Installment and\n(In thousands) Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ 955 $ 1,363 $ 3,409 $ 525 $ 3,930 $ 10,182\nImpact of ASC 326 adoption 1,336 2,359 720 1,025 927 6,367\nProvision (reversal) for credit losses (1) (487) (974) (452) 17 2,348 452\nCharge-offs — — — — (1,587) (1,587)\nRecoveries 1 53 — — 181 235\nEnding balance $ 1,805 $ 2,801 $ 3,677 $ 1,567 $ 5,799 $ 15,649\n(1) There was also a provision of $135,000 for unfunded loan commitments during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans\nA loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through\nthe operation or sale of the collateral.\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in collateral-dependent loans by type of loan:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNumber of Number of\nCollateral- Collateral-\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Dependent Loans Amount Dependent Loans\nReal estate construction and development loans $ 11,985 3 $ 11,390 3\nAgricultural loans 390 1 390 1\nTotal $ 12,375 4 $ 11,780 4\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, and undisbursed funds on lines of credit. The\nCompany evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments in the same manner as it evaluates credit risk within the loan portfolio.\nThere was a reversal of provision of $270,000 for unfunded loan commitments made during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreasing the liability\nbalance to $462,000. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, there was no provision made for unfunded loan commitments. The balance for unfunded loan\ncommitments totaled $954,000 at September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, a reversal of provision of $373,000 and a\nprovision of $135,000 were made, respectively, for unfunded loan commitments. The reserve for the unfunded loan commitments is a liability on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and is included in other liabilities.\nLoan Modifications\nOccasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, and other-than-insignificant\npayment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit\nlosses. There was one loan modification made during the nine\n21\nTable of Contents\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and no modifications made during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There was one loan modifications during\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following tables present loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nPrincipal Interest Rate Total % of Loans\n(In thousands) Forgiveness Term Extension Reduction Payment Delay Outstanding\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ 1,700 $ — $ — 0.17%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nPrincipal Interest Rate Total % of Loans\n(In thousands) Forgiveness Term Extension Reduction Payment Delay Outstanding\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ 52 $ — $ — <0.01%\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nPrincipal Interest Rate Total % of Loans\n(In thousands) Forgiveness Term Extension Reduction Payment Delay Outstanding\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ 1,700 $ — $ — 0.17%\n4. Student Loans\nIncluded in the installment loan portfolio are $36.1 million and $38.5 million in student loans at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively,\nmade to medical and pharmacy school students. Upon graduation, the loan is automatically placed in a grace period of six months. This may be extended up to\n48 months for graduates enrolling in internships, medical residency, or fellowship programs. As approved, the student may receive additional deferment for\nhardship or administrative reasons in the form of forbearance for a maximum of 36 months throughout the life of the loan. Student loans have not been\noriginated or purchased since 2019.\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the reserve against the student loan portfolio was $6.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, there were $794,000 in student loans in the substandard category. At December 31, 2023, there were $426,000 in student loans included in\nthe substandard category.\nThe following tables summarize the credit quality indicators for outstanding student loans:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Number of Loans Principal Amount Accrued Interest Number of Loans Principal Amount Accrued Interest\nSchool 27 $ 740 $ 518 44 $ 1,242 $ 734\nGrace 12 269 193 18 473 296\nRepayment 408 19,077 296 444 20,833 289\nDeferment 220 9,956 2,362 237 10,163 2,022\nForbearance 97 6,087 216 98 5,782 133\nTotal 764 $ 36,129 $ 3,585 841 $ 38,493 $ 3,474\nSchool - The time in which the borrower is still actively in school at least half-time. No payments are expected during this stage, though the borrower may\nmake payments during this time.\nGrace - A six-month period of time granted upon graduation, or end of active-student status, during which payment is not required but interest continues to\naccrue. Upon completion of the six-month grace period, the loan is transferred to repayment status. This status may also represent an in-school borrower\nactivated to military duty. The borrower must return to at least half-time status within six months of their active-duty end date to return to in-school status.\n22\nTable of Contents\nRepayment - The time in which the borrower is no longer attending school at least half-time, and has not received an approved grace, deferment, or\nforbearance. Regular payment is expected from these borrowers under an allotted payment plan.\nDeferment - May be granted for up to 48 months for borrowers who have begun the repayment period on their loans but are either actively enrolled in an\neligible school at least half-time or actively enrolled in an approved and verifiable medical residency, internship, or fellowship program.\nForbearance - The period of time during which the borrower may postpone making principal and interest payments due to either hardship or administrative\nreasons. Interest will continue to accrue on loans during periods of authorized forbearance and will be capitalized at the end of the forbearance period. If the\nborrower is delinquent at the time the forbearance is granted, unpaid interest and interest accrued during the delinquency will also be capitalized. Loan terms\nwill not change as a result of forbearance and payment amounts may be increased to allow the loan to pay off in the required time frame. A forbearance that\nresults in an insignificant delay in payment, is not considered a concessionary change in terms, provided the borrower affirms the obligation. Forbearance is not\nan uncommon status designation and is considered standard industry practice, consistent with the succession of students migrating from school to career.\nHowever, additional risk is associated with this designation.\nStudent Loan Aging\nStudent loans are generally charged off at the end of the quarter during which the account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Accrued but unpaid interest\nrelated to charged-off student loans is reversed and charged against interest income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $131,000 in accrued\ninterest receivable was reversed, due to charge-offs of $1.4 million.

All lines of credit are on an “as available” basis and can be revoked by\nthe grantor at any time. These lines of credit have interest rates that are generally tied to the Federal Funds rate or are indexed to short-term U.S. Treasury rates\nor SOFR. At September 30, 2024, pledged collateral at the Federal Home Loan Bank consisted of $2.0 million in available-for-sale investment securities and\n$228.1 million in loan balances. Pledged collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank consisted of $3.8 million in available-for-sale investment securities and $633.1\nmillion in loan balances. At December 31, 2023, $230.1 million in loans and $2.1 million in available-for-sale investment securities were pledged as collateral\nfor FHLB advances. Additionally, $604.0 million in loans and $4.1 million in available-for-sale investment securities were pledged as collateral for advances at\nthe Federal Reserve Bank.\n7. Leases\nThe Company leases land and premises for its branch banking offices, administration facility, and ITMs. The initial terms of these leases expire at various dates\nthrough 2044. Under the provisions of most of these leases, the Company has the option to extend the leases beyond their original terms at rental rates adjusted\nto certain economic indices or market conditions. Lease terms may also include options for termination. Under guidance from Topic 842, the discount rate\napplied to the lease liability is calculated by determining the Bank’s incremental borrowing rate. Current rates for fully-secured loans with amounts and terms\nsimilar to the lease amount and term at inception are used to calculate the incremental borrowing rate. The liability is reduced at each reporting period based on\nthe discounted present value of remaining payments. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 13 operating leases and no financing leases.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease expense $ 199 $ 178 $ 562 $ 533\nVariable lease expense — — — —\nTotal $ 199 $ 178 $ 562 $ 533\n24\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental information related to leases is as follows:\nNine Months Ended\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 567 $ 533\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 2,320 $ —\nWeighted-average remaining lease term in years for operating leases 8.71 4.24\nWeighted-average discount rate for operating leases 5.06 % 5.10 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024\n2025 $ 754\n2026 522\n2027 426\n2028 414\n2029 357\nThereafter 1,633\nTotal undiscounted cash flows 4,106\nLess: present value discount (840)\nPresent value of net future minimum lease payments $ 3,266\n8.

Dividends on and Repurchase of Common Stock\nOn September 24, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend was\npayable on October 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of October 7, 2024. Approximately $2.1 million was transferred from retained earnings to dividends\npayable as of September 30, 2024, to allow for distribution of the dividend to shareholders.\nThe Company has a program to repurchase up to $3.0 million of its outstanding common stock. The timing of the purchases will depend on certain factors\nincluding, but not limited to, market conditions and prices, available funds, and alternative uses of capital. The stock repurchase program may be carried out\nthrough open-market purchases, block trades, or negotiated private transactions. For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and\nSeptember 30, 2023, no shares have been repurchased.\n25\nTable of Contents\n10.

Taxes on Income\nThe Company periodically reviews its tax positions under the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes, which defines the criteria that an\nindividual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity’s financial statements. Under the\nguidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained on examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion\nis met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority and all available information is known to the taxing\nauthority.\nThe Company periodically evaluates its deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required based upon a determination that some or all\nof the deferred assets may not be ultimately realized. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the Company had no recorded valuation allowance. The\nCompany is no longer subject to examinations by taxing authorities for years before 2019 and 2018 for Federal and California jurisdictions, respectively.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. There were no interest or penalties\nrecognized on uncertain tax positions during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company reported a provision for income taxes of $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.6 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company reported a provision for income taxes of $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.9\nmillion for the comparable period of 2023. The effective tax rate was 25.43% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 28.78% for the for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate was 27.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29.00% for the comparable\nperiod of 2023.\n12. Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities\nThe contractual principal balance of the Company’s debentures relating to its trust preferred securities is $12.0 million as of September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at any time at par.\nThe Company accounts for its junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II at fair value. The Company believes the election of fair value\naccounting for the junior subordinated debentures better reflects the true economic value of the debt instrument on the consolidated balance sheet. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the rate paid on the junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II is the forward 3-month SOFR rate of 4.63% plus 129\nbasis points and is adjusted quarterly. At December 31, 2023, the rate paid on the junior subordinated debt was the forward 3-month SOFR rate of 5.33% plus\n129 basis points\n26\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company performed a fair value measurement analysis on its junior subordinated debt using a cash flow model approach to\ndetermine its present value. The cash flow model approach utilizes the forward three-month SOFR curve to estimate future quarterly interest payments due\nover the life of the debt instrument. Cash flows were discounted at a rate based on current market rates for similar-term debt instruments and adjusted for\nadditional credit and liquidity risks associated with junior subordinated debt. The 5.83% discount rate used at September 30, 2024 represents an investor’s\nyield based on current market assumptions. At December 31, 2023, the discount rate was 6.14%. At September 30, 2024, the total cumulative gain recorded on\nthe debt was $1.3 million.\nThe following table provides detail on the Company’s junior subordinated debt/trust preferred securities:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet fair value calculation gain (loss) $ 65 $ (234) $ (179) $ 29\nOther comprehensive income (loss) gain (596) 576 (321) 523\nRecognized gain (loss) on fair value 661 (811) 141 (553)\nCumulative gain recorded 1,282 1,702 1,282 1,702\nDiscount rate 5.83 % 7.23 % 5.83 % 7.23 %\nThe net fair value calculation performed as of September 30, 2024, resulted in a net pretax loss adjustment of $179,000 for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to a net pretax gain adjustment of $29,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net $179,000 fair value loss adjustment was separately presented as a $141,000 gain, ($99,000 net of tax)\nrecognized on the consolidated statements of income, and a $321,000 loss, ($226,000 net of tax) associated with the instrument-specific credit risk recognized\nin other comprehensive income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net $29,000 fair value gain adjustment was separately presented as a\n$553,000 loss, ($390,000 net of tax) recognized on the consolidated statements of income, and a $523,000 gain, ($368,000 net of tax) associated with the\ninstrument-specific credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company calculated the change in the discounted cash flows based on updated\nmarket credit spreads for the periods indicated.\n13. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\nThe following summary disclosures are made in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC Topic 825 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” which\nrequires the disclosure of fair value information for both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments where it is practicable to estimate that value.\nGAAP guidance clarifies the definition of fair value, describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and expands fair value disclosure requirements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair\nvalue measurements.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\n• Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (as defined) for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to\naccess at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and reflect the reporting entity’s assumptions regarding the pricing of an asset or\nliability by a market participant (including assumptions about risk).\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value\nmeasurements are categorized at the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nQuoted Prices In\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nEstimated Fair for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable\n(In thousands) Carrying Amount Value Assets Level 1 Level 2 Inputs Level 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 165,211 $ 165,211 $ 2,835 $ 162,376 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,624 3,624 3,624 — —\nLoans, net 958,628 934,291 — — 934,291\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 82,044 82,777 — — 82,777\nShort-term borrowings 34,000 34,000 34,000 — —\nJunior subordinated debt 11,393 11,393 — — 11,393\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices In\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nEstimated Fair for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable\n(In thousands) Carrying Amount Value Assets Level 1 Level 2 Inputs Level 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 181,266 $ 181,266 $ 12,438 $ 168,828 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 3,354 — —\nLoans, net 904,384 871,681 — — 871,681\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 71,848 71,414 — — 71,414\nShort-term borrowings 62,000 62,000 62,000 — —\nJunior subordinated debt 11,213 11,213 — — 11,213\nThe Company performs fair value measurements on certain assets and liabilities as the result of the application of current accounting guidelines. Some fair\nvalue measurements, such as those on investment securities and junior subordinated debt, are performed on a recurring basis, while others, such as evaluations\nof loans, other real estate owned, goodwill, and other intangibles, are performed on a nonrecurring basis.\n• Level 1 financial assets consist of money market funds and highly liquid mutual funds for which fair values are based on quoted market prices.\n• Level 2 financial assets include highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. government agencies, collateralized mortgage obligations, and debt obligations\nof states and political subdivisions, whose fair values are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for the identical or similar underlying\nsecurity that may or may not be actively traded.\n• Level 3 financial assets include certain instruments where the assumptions may be made by the Company or third parties about assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 when a change in circumstances warrants a transfer. There were no transfers between fair value\nmeasurement classifications during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, or the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis:\nInvestment Securities - Available-for-sale and marketable equity security values are based on open-market price quotes obtained from reputable third-party\nbrokers. Market pricing is based upon specific CUSIP identification for each individual\n28\nTable of Contents\nsecurity. To the extent there are observable prices in the market, the mid-point of the bid/ask price is used to determine the fair value of individual securities. If\nthat data is not available for the last 30 days, a Level-2 type matrix-pricing approach, based on comparable securities in the market, is utilized. Level 2 pricing\nmay include the use of a forward spread from the last observable trade or may use a proxy bond, such as a TBA mortgage, to determine the price for the\nsecurity being valued. Changes in fair market value are recorded through other accumulated comprehensive income as an unrecognized gain or loss on fair\nvalue.\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans - Fair value measurements for individually-evaluated loans are performed pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance and are\nbased upon either collateral values supported by third-party appraisals or observed market prices. Collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment\nusing the fair value of the collateral. There were no individually-evaluated loans measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO)\nare measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third-party appraisals of the property, resulting\nin a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. No OREO properties\nwere measured at fair value as of September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\nJunior Subordinated Debt - The fair value of the junior subordinated debt is based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing observable market rates and\ncredit characteristics for similar debt instruments. In its analysis, the Company uses characteristics that market participants would generally use and considers\nfactors specific to the liability and the principal, or most advantageous, market for the liability. Cash flows are discounted at a rate that incorporates a current\nmarket rate for similar-term debt instruments, adjusted for credit and liquidity risks associated with similar junior subordinated debt and circumstances unique\nto the Company. The Company believes that the subjective nature of these inputs, credit concerns in the capital markets, and inactivity in the trust preferred\nmarkets, limit the observability of market spreads, requiring the junior subordinated debt to be classified at a Level 3 fair value.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets Significant\nfor Identical Significant Other Unobservable\nSeptember 30, Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) 2024 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 2,987 $ — $ 2,987 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 84,771 — 84,771 —\nMunicipal bonds 44,034 — 44,034 —\nCorporate bond 33,419 — 33,419 —\nTotal AFS securities 165,211 — 165,211 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,624 3,624 — —\nTotal $ 168,835 $ 3,624 $ 165,211 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 11,393 $ — $ — $ 11,393\nTotal $ 11,393 $ — $ — $ 11,393\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023:\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nActive Markets Other Significant\nfor Identical Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 6,156 $ — $ 6,156 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 88,184 — 88,184 —\nMunicipal bonds 42,365 — 42,365 —\nTreasury securities 12,438 — 12,438 —\nCorporate bonds 32,122 — 32,122 —\nTotal AFS securities 181,265 — 181,265 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 — —\nTotal $ 184,619 $ 3,354 $ 181,265 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nTotal $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nThere were no non-recurring fair value adjustments at September 30, 2024, or December 31, 2023.\nThe following table provides a description of the valuation technique, unobservable input, and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs for the\nCompany’s assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nFinancial Valuation Unobservable Weighted Average Financial Valuation Unobservable Weighted Average\nInstrument Technique Input Instrument Technique Input\nJunior Discounted cash Market credit 5.83% Junior Discounted cash Market credit 6.14%\nSubordinated flow risk-adjusted Subordinated flow risk-adjusted\nDebt spreads Debt spreads\nManagement believes that the credit risk-adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated debentures is indicative of the\nnonperformance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current, inactive market conditions. Management attributes the change in fair\nvalue of the junior subordinated debentures to market changes in the nonperformance expectations and pricing of this type of debt. Generally, an increase in the\ncredit risk-adjusted spread and/or a decrease in the forward three-month SOFR curve will result in a positive fair value adjustment and a decrease in the fair\nvalue measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and/or an increase in the forward three-month SOFR curve will result in a\nnegative fair value adjustment and an increase in the fair value measurement. The decrease in discount rate between the periods ended September 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023, is primarily due to decreases in rates for similar debt instruments.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of liabilities at fair value using Level 3 significant, unobservable inputs on a recurring basis:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nJunior Subordinated Debt:\nBeginning balance $ 11,454 $ 10,719 $ 11,213 $ 10,883\nGross (gain) loss included in earnings (661) 811 (141) 553\nGross loss (gain) related to changes in instrument-specific credit risk 596 (576) 320 (523)\nIncrease in accrued interest 4 $ 12 1 53\nEnding balance $ 11,393 $ 10,966 $ 11,393 $ 10,966\nAmount of total (gain) loss for the period included in earnings attributable to\nthe change in unrealized gains or losses relating to liabilities held at the\nreporting date $ (661) $ 811 $ (141) $ 553\n14.

Investment in York Monterey Properties\nThe Bank wholly owns the subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. (“Properties”), which is organized as a California corporation. The Bank capitalized the\nsubsidiary through the transfer of eight unimproved lots at a historical cost of $5.3 million comprised of approximately 186.97 acres in the York Highlands\nsubdivision of the Monterra Ranch residential development in Monterey County, California, together with cash contributions. The Bank transferred the\nproperties to York Monterey Properties, Inc., to maintain ownership beyond the ten-year regulatory holding period applicable to a state bank. The Bank\nacquired five of the lots through a non-judicial foreclosure on or about May 29, 2009. In addition, the Bank purchased three of the lots from another bank. The\nBank has continuously held the Properties from the date of foreclosure and acquisition until the time of transfer. At the time of transfer, the Properties had\nreached the end of the ten-year regulatory holding period limit.\nAt both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank’s investment in York Monterey Properties, Inc., totaled $5.0 million. York Monterey Properties,\nInc., is included within the consolidated financial statements of the Company, with $4.6 of the total investment recognized within the balance of other real\nestate owned on the consolidated balance sheets.\n31\nTable of Contents\n17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk: The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks which arise in the normal\ncourse of business. These instruments, which may contain elements of credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, include commitments to extend credit and\nstandby letters of credit. The credit risks associated with these instruments are essentially the same as those involved in extending credit to customers and are\nrepresented by the contractual amount indicated in the table below:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommitments to extend credit $ 131,947 $ 183,537\nStandby letters of credit $ 12,774 $ 2,940\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as conditions established in the contract have not been violated. These\ncommitments are floating-rate instruments based on the current prime rate, and, in most cases, have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates each\ncustomer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral obtained is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral held varies\nbut includes accounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing properties. As many of the\ncommitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the\nCompany.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company’s letters of credit are short-term\nguarantees and generally have terms from one month to three years. At September 30, 2024, the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments\nthe Company could be required to make under outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $12.8 million.\nThe remaining unfunded commitments for the investment in limited partnerships as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, totaled $2,600,000 and\n$800,000, respectively.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in litigation arising out of its normal business activities. Management, after consultation\nwith legal counsel, believes that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from the disposition of such claims would not be material to the financial position of the\nCompany.\n32\nTable of Contents\nItem 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nCertain matters discussed, or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report of Form 10-Q, contain forward-looking statements about the Company that are\nintended to be covered by the safe harbor for “forward-looking statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are not\nguarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

One of the primary strategic goals of the Company is to maintain a mix of\nassets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk and to finance those assets with a low-cost and stable source of funds. Liquidity and\ncapital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth.\n34\nTable of Contents\nSince the Bank primarily conducts banking operations in California’s Central Valley, its operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic\ncondition of the Central Valley. Business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits, and real estate\nactivity in the Central Valley, and declines in economic conditions can have materially-adverse effects on the Bank. Due to the Central Valley’s economic\ndependence on agriculture, a downturn in agriculture and agricultural-related business could indirectly and adversely affect the Company as many borrowers\nand customers are involved in, or are to some extent impacted by, the agricultural industry. The agricultural industry has been affected by declines in prices and\nchanges in yields of various crops and other agricultural commodities. Weaker prices could reduce the cash flows generated by farms and the value of\nagricultural land in our local markets and thereby increase the risk of default by our borrowers or reduce the foreclosure value of agricultural land and\nequipment that serve as collateral for our loans. Moreover, weaker prices might stress or threaten farming operations in the Central Valley, potentially reducing\nmarket demand for agricultural lending. In particular, farm income has seen recent declines, and in line with the downturn in farm income, farmland prices are\ncoming under pressure. While most of our borrowers are not directly involved in agriculture, they would likely be impacted by downturns in the agricultural\nindustry as many jobs in our market areas are ancillary to the regular production, processing, marketing, and sale of agricultural commodities. Despite the\nunusually wet winter experienced recently, the state of California has experienced severe droughts in the past which have resulted in water-allocation\nreductions for farmers in the Central Valley. Due to these uncertain water issues, the impact on businesses and consumers located in the Company’s market\nareas is not possible to predict or quantify. In response to drought conditions, the California state legislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management\nAct in 2014 with the goal of ensuring better local and regional management of groundwater use and sustainable groundwater management in California by\n2042. Development, preparation, and implementation of the Groundwater Sustainability Plan began in 2020. The effects of this plan have yet to be determined.\nThe Company’s earnings are impacted by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Bank (FRB)\nhas a significant impact on the operating results of depository institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, to curb\ninflation or combat a recession. The FRB affects the levels of bank loans, investments. and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States\ngovernment securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks, and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks may\nbe subject. At their September 2024 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased interest rates by 50 basis points, lowering rates for the\nfirst time in four years. Further decreases are currently expected over the next few years. It is unknown what effects increases or decreases in the inflation rate\nand the recent banking turmoil, in conjunction with continued international instability, will have on FRB monetary policies.\nThe Company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area. Managing the balance sheet,\nenhancing revenue sources, attracting and retaining deposit customers, and maintaining market share will continue to be of primary importance.\nResults of Operations\nOn a year-to-date basis, the Company reported net income of $12.3 million, or $0.72 per share ($0.72 diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $14.4 million, or $0.84 per share ($0.84 diluted), for the same period in 2023. The Company’s annualized return on average assets was 1.36% for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.52% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s annualized return on average\nequity was 12.95% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the\nreturn on average assets is primarily attributable to decreases in income and average assets. The decrease in the return on average equity is primarily due to a\ndecrease in net income and an increase in average equity.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets\nand interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the three

Future increases or decreases will affect both interest income\nand expense and the resultant net interest margin.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,\nreferred to as volume change. Both are also affected by changes in yields on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as\nrate change. The following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities, and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the periods indicated.\nRate and Volume Analysis:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023\n(In thousands) Rate Volume Total\nIncrease (decrease) in interest income:\nLoans $ 590 $ 48 $ 638\nInvestment securities available for sale 90 (283) (193)\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB 13 (31) (18)\nTotal interest income 693 (266) 427\nIncrease (decrease) in interest expense:\nInterest-bearing demand accounts 1,212 286 1,498\nSavings and money market accounts (194) 1 (193)\nTime deposits 51 (133) (82)\nOther borrowings 126 (815) (689)\nJunior subordinated debentures 2 — 2\nTotal interest expense 1,197 (661) 536\nIncrease (decrease) in net interest income $ (504) $ 395 $ (109)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, total interest income increased $427,000, or 2.8%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn comparing the two periods, average interest-earning assets decreased $35.1 million, with a decrease of $36.5 million in average investment securities\nbalances and a decrease of $2.0 million in average balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, offset by an increase of $2.4 million in average loan balances.\nThe increase in average loan balances is attributed primarily to increases in the commercial and industrial portfolio, the real estate mortgage portfolio, and the\nagricultural portfolio, offset by decreases in the real estate construction portfolio and the installment portfolio. Loan yields increased 27 basis points and\ninvestment securities yields increased 18 basis points. The average yield on total interest-earning assets increased 34 basis points. The increase in yields is a\nresult of the increases in loan yields, investment securities yields, and yields on overnight deposits held at the Federal Reserve Bank.\n38\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to September 30, 2023\n(In thousands) Rate Volume Total\nIncrease (decrease) in interest income:\nLoans $ 2,163 $ (998) $ 1,165\nInvestment securities available for sale 317 (854) (537)\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB 22 (16) 6\nTotal interest income 2,502 (1,868) 634\nIncrease (decrease) in interest expense:\nInterest-bearing demand accounts 1,568 (314) 1,254\nSavings and money market accounts — (1) (1)\nTime deposits 278 (15) 263\nOther borrowings 115 1,283 1,398\nJunior subordinated debentures 42 — 42\nTotal interest expense 2,003 953 2,956\nIncrease (decrease) in net interest income $ 499 $ (2,821) $ (2,322)\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total interest income increased $634,000, or 1.41%, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIn comparing the two periods, average interest-earning assets decreased $61.3 million, with a decrease of $24.6 million in average loan balances, a decrease of\n$37.6 million in average investment securities balances, and a decrease of $382,000 in average balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The increase in\naverage loan balances is attributed primarily to increases in the agricultural portfolio, the commercial and industrial portfolio, and the installment portfolio,\noffset by decreases in the real estate construction and development portfolio and the real estate mortgage portfolio. Loan yields increased 31 basis points and\ninvestment securities yields increased 22 basis points. The average yield on total interest-earning assets increased 36 basis points. Yields on loans, investment\nsecurities, and overnight deposits increased due to rate increases.\nThe overall average yield on the loan portfolio increased to 6.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.70% for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, 31.0% of the Company’s loan portfolio consisted of floating rate instruments, compared to 31.7% of the\nportfolio at December 31, 2023, with the majority of those tied to the prime rate. Approximately 63.2%, or $191.4 million, of the floating-rate loans had rate\nfloors at September 30, 2024.\nApproximately 56.3%, or $164.0 million, of the floating-rate loans had rate floors at December 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s net interest margin decreased to 4.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.32% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The net interest margin decreased primarily as a result of increases in deposit and short-term borrowing costs, offset by increases in yields\non interest-earning assets. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased from 5.20% to 5.56%. Yields on average interest-bearing liabilities increased\nfrom 1.41% to 1.97%.\nWhile deposit rates have increased, the Company’s disciplined deposit pricing efforts have helped keep the Company’s cost of funds relatively low. The rates\npaid on interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.97% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.41% for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total interest expense increased approximately $3.0 million, or 38.9%, as compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. Between those two periods, average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $9.0 million due to decreases in NOW and\nmoney market accounts, savings accounts, and time deposits, partially offset by increases in short-term borrowings. The Company may purchase brokered\ndeposits as an additional source of funding. At September 30, 2024, the Company held $100.3 million in brokered deposits. At December 31, 2023, the\nCompany held no brokered deposits.\n39\nTable of Contents\nInterest-Earning Assets and Liabilities:\nThe following table summarizes the year-to-date (YTD) averages of the components of interest-earning assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets\nand the components of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities:\nYTD Averages\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023\nLoans 84.08% 82.11% 81.84%\nInvestment securities available for sale 15.50% 17.36% 17.73%\nInterest-bearing deposits in other banks 0.42% 0.53% 0.43%\nTotal interest-earning assets 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%\nNOW accounts 17.82% 18.90% 19.17%\nMoney market accounts 42.78% 42.98% 46.04%\nSavings accounts 16.47% 16.46% 16.41%\nTime deposits 10.36% 11.46% 10.37%\nOther borrowings 10.83% 8.71% 6.52%\nJunior subordinated debentures 1.74% 1.49% 1.49%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%\nNoninterest Income\nChanges in Noninterest Income:\nThe following tables set forth the amount and percentage changes in the categories presented for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024,\nand 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nCustomer service fees $ 719 $ 686 $ 33 4.8 %\nIncrease in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance 132 102 30 29.4 %\nGain (loss) on fair value of marketable equity securities 224 (92) 316 343.5 %\nGain (loss) on fair value of junior subordinated debentures 661 (811) 1,472 181.5 %\nOther 287 229 58 25.3 %\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,023 $ 114 $ 1,909 1,674.6 %\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, increased $1.9 million to $2.0 million compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

The increase was primarily attributed to increases in professional fees and salaries and employee benefits, and was partially offset by decreases in\noccupancy expense and regulatory assessments. Professional fees increased primarily due to increases in service contract expenses related to recently\noutsourced information technology services. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was caused by increases in salary expenses, 401(k) expenses, and\nstock compensation expense.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s income tax expense is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income\nreported for tax purposes, as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the Company’s pretax income or loss shown in the statements of operations\nand comprehensive income. As pretax income or loss amounts become smaller, the impact of these differences becomes more significant and are reflected as\nvariances in the Company’s effective tax rate for the periods presented. In general, the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a\npositive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the Company’s statements of income and comprehensive income.\nThe Company reviews its current tax positions at least quarterly based on the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes. These standards\nidentify the individual tax position criteria that would have to be met to recognize an income tax benefit on a taxable entity’s financial statements. Under the\nincome tax guidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position\nwill be sustained on examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. In assessing whether the more likely than not\ncriterion is met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority.\nThe Company has reviewed all of its tax positions as of September 30, 2024, and has determined that there are no material additional amounts to be recorded\nunder the current income tax accounting guidelines.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 25.43% compared to 28.78% for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. The Company’s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 27.88% compared to 29.00% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table illustrates the changes in balances as of and for the periods ended:\nYear-to-Date $ Prior Period $\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Change Change\nDue from Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) $ 3,912 $ 207 $ 968 $ 3,705 $ 2,944\nNet loans 958,628 904,384 957,222 54,244 1,406\nInvestment securities 168,835 184,620 187,857 (15,785) (19,022)\nTotal assets 1,255,376 1,211,045 1,273,092 44,331 (17,716)\nTotal deposits 1,065,021 1,004,477 987,631 60,544 77,390\nTotal liabilities 1,122,520 1,088,503 1,158,064 34,017 (35,544)\nAverage interest-earning assets 1,096,012 1,147,728 1,157,290 (51,716) (61,278)\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities 714,580 725,075 723,616 (10,495) (9,036)\nNet loans increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and on a year-over-year basis, due to organic loan growth. Investment securities\ndecreased on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis due to repayments of principal and maturities.

Commercial real estate balances increased to $439.2 million at September 30, 2024, from $386.1 million at December 31, 2023.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short- to medium-term, fixed- and floating-rate instruments and are mainly secured by commercial income\nand multi-family residential properties.\nResidential mortgage loans are generally 30-year amortizing loans with an average life of nine to 11 years. These loans totaled $248.7 million, or 25.5%, of the\nportfolio at September 30, 2024, $260.5 million, or 28.3%, of the portfolio at December 31, 2023, and $262.4 million, or 27.0%, of the portfolio at\nSeptember 30, 2023. Included in the residential mortgage portfolio are purchased home-mortgage loan pools with aggregate balances of $223.9 million,\ncomprising 90.0% of the total residential mortgage portfolio at September 30, 2024. These loans were purchased in whole-loan form, in several pools, during\n2021 and 2022.

Loans in this category are secured by real estate, including improved and unimproved land, as well as single-family\nresidential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements.\nRepayment on construction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at the completion of the project or from\nthe sale of the constructed homes to individuals.\nCommercial and industrial loans increased $3.3 million between December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, and increased $4.8 million between\nSeptember 30, 2023, and September 30, 2024.

Student loans decreased $3.5 million between the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, due to paydowns,\nconsolidations with other lenders, and charge-offs.

Losses are implicit in lending activities and the amount of such losses will vary, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan\nportfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), effective January 1, 2023, and utilizes a current expected credit loss\n(CECL) methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the\ndata to determine pool loss experience. The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar\ncharacteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them separately. The\nCompany also uses the CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of\ncredit. While the allowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-asset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposure\nis reported as a liability.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe eight (8) segments of the loan portfolio are as follows, net of unearned fees and unamortized loan origination costs (subtotals are provided as needed to\nallow the reader to reconcile the amounts to loan classifications reported elsewhere in this report):\nLoan Segments for Allowance for Credit Loss Analysis\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial and business loans $ 56,621 $ 53,273\nGovernment program loans 65 74\nTotal commercial and industrial 56,686 53,347\nReal estate – mortgage:\nCommercial real estate 439,187 386,134\nResidential mortgages 248,695 260,539\nHome improvement and home equity loans 26 36\nTotal real estate mortgage 687,908 646,709\nReal estate construction and development 123,624 127,944\nAgricultural 66,547 49,795\nInstallment and student loans 40,386 42,247\nTotal loans $ 975,151 $ 920,042\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans and Specific Reserves:\nThe following table summarizes the components of individually-evaluated loans and related specific reserves:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nIndividually- Individually-\nEvaluated Loan Evaluated Loan\n(In thousands) Balances Specific Reserve Balances Specific Reserve\nReal estate construction and development $ 11,985 $ — $ 11,390 $ —\nAgricultural 397 — 451 14\nTotal individually-evaluated loans $ 12,382 $ — $ 11,841 $ 14\nIndividually-evaluated loans increased $541,000 to $12.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.8 million at December 31, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the reserve against the student loan portfolio totaled $6.8 million\nand $6.3 million, respectively. Loan interest rates on the student loan portfolio are primarily variable and ranged from 6.00% to 13.125% at September 30,\n2024, and 6.00% to 13.250% at December 31, 2023.\nNonperforming Assets:\nThe following table summarizes the components of nonperforming assets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, and the percentage of\nnonperforming assets to total gross loans, total assets, and the percentage of nonperforming assets to allowance for loan losses:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nNonaccrual loans $ 12,002 $ 11,448\nLoans past due 90 days or more, still accruing 794 426\nLoan modifications 52 —\nTotal nonperforming loans 12,848 11,874\nOther real estate owned 4,582 4,582\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 17,430 $ 16,456\nNonperforming loans to total gross loans 1.32 % 1.29 %\nNonperforming assets to total assets 1.39 % 1.36 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans 128.60 % 131.87 %\nNonperforming assets, which are primarily related to the real estate loan and other-real-estate-owned portfolio, increased $974,000 from $16.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, to $17.4 million at September 30, 2024. Nonaccrual loan balances increased to $12.0 million between the two periods. All nonaccrual\nloans are well-collateralized and in the process of collection.\nThe following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 $ Change\nNonaccrual Loans:\nReal estate construction and development $ 11,995 $ 11,403 $ 592\nAgricultural 7 45 (38)\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 12,002 $ 11,448 $ 554\nLoans past due more than 30 days receive increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk. The Company continues to move past-due\nloans to nonaccrual status in an ongoing effort to recognize and address loan problems as early and\n48\nTable of Contents\nmost effectively as possible and appropriate. As individually-evaluated loans, nonaccrual, and modified loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations, the\nallowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly.\nExcept for nonaccrual and individually-evaluated loans, there were no loans at September 30, 2024, where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the\nCompany to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms.\nNonaccrual loans, totaling $12.0 million at September 30, 2024, increased $554,000 from $11.4 million at December 31, 2023, with real estate construction\nloans comprising 99.9% of total nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024. In determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans,\nmanagement monitors trends within specific geographical areas, loan-to-value ratios, appraisals, and other credit-related issues. Nonaccrual loans represented\n1.23% of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 1.24% at December 31, 2023. The loan allowance for credit loss represented 137.67% and 136.77%,\nrespectively, of nonaccrual loans for the same periods.\nOther real estate owned through foreclosure remained at $4.6 million for the periods ended September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. Nonperforming\nassets as a percentage of total assets increased from 1.36% at December 31, 2023, to 1.39% at September 30, 2024.\nManagement continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the\nallowance for credit losses required to cover identified and potential losses in the loan portfolio. Focus has been placed on monitoring and reducing the level of\nproblem assets.\nThe following table summarizes special mention loans by type as of:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial and industrial $ 6,581 $ —\nCommercial real estate mortgage 5,686 5,796\nAgricultural 4,966 2,974\nTotal special mention loans $ 17,233 $ 8,770\nThe Company remains focused on competition and other economic conditions within its market area which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the\nportfolio. The Company continues to experience increased competition from major banks, local independents, and non-bank institutions, which creates pressure\non loan pricing. Increased emphasis has been placed on reducing both the level of nonperforming assets and potential losses on the disposition of those assets.\nIt is in the best interest of both the Company and the borrowers to seek alternative options to foreclosure to reduce the impacts on the real estate market. As part\nof this strategy, the Company enters into loan modifications when it improves collection prospects. Management recognizes the increased risk of loss due to the\nCompany’s exposure to local and worldwide economic conditions, as well as potentially volatile real estate markets, and takes these factors into consideration\nwhen analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\n49\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a summary of the Company’s allowance for loan credit losses, loan loss provisions, and charge-off and recovery activity affecting\nthe allowance for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Summary of Activity:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTotal loans outstanding at end of period before deducting allowances for credit losses $ 975,151 $ 972,871\nAverage loans outstanding during period 933,449 958,038\nBalance of allowance at beginning of period $ 15,658 $ 16,549\nLoans charged-off:\nInstallment and student loans (1,471) (1,587)\nTotal loans charged-off (1,471) (1,587)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off:\nReal estate 5 53\nCommercial and industrial 1 1\nInstallment and student loans 190 181\nTotal loan recoveries 196 235\nNet loans charged-off (1,275) (1,352)\nProvision (1) 2,140 452\nBalance of allowance for credit losses at end of period $ 16,523 $ 15,649\nNet loan charged-off to total average loans (annualized) 0.18 % 0.19 %\nNet loan charged-off to loans at end of period (annualized) 0.13 % 0.56 %\nAllowance for credit losses to total loans at end of period 1.69 % 1.61 %\nNet loan charged-off to allowance for credit losses (annualized) 30.04 % 34.56 %\nProvision for credit losses to net charged-off (annualized) 223.79 % 44.58 %\n(1) There was a reversal of provision of $373,000 for unfunded loan commitments and a provision for overdrafts of $17,000 made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There was a provision of $135,000 for\nunfunded loan commitments made during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nProvisions for credit losses are determined based on management’s periodic credit review of the loan portfolio, consideration of past loan loss experience,\nexpected losses within the portfolio, current and future economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. Management believes its estimate of the allowance for\ncredit losses adequately covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio and, based on the condition of the loan portfolio, management believes the\nallowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a $2.1 million provision was recorded to the\nallowance for credit losses as compared to a $452,000 provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe following provides a summary of the Company’s net charge-offs as a percentage of average loan balances (including nonaccrual loans) in each category\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet Charge-offs Average Loan Net Charge-offs Average Loan\n(In thousands) (Recoveries) Balance Percentage (Recoveries) Balance Percentage\nCommercial and industrial $ (1) $ 56,324 <0.01% $ (1) $ 49,063 <0.01%\nReal estate mortgages (5) 662,786 <0.01% (53) 666,797 <0.01%\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment — 119,171 — % — 144,205 — %\nAgricultural — 53,747 — % — 53,201 — %\nInstallment and student loans 1,281 41,421 3.09 % 1,406 44,772 3.14 %\nTotal $ 1,275 $ 933,449 0.14 % $ 1,352 $ 958,038 0.14 %\n50\nTable of Contents\nNet charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $1.2 million as compared to net charge-offs of $1.4 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2023. The Company charged off or had partial charge-offs on 27 loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24\nloans during the same period ended September 30, 2023. The annualized percentage of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.18% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 0.19% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s loans, net of\nunearned fees, increased from $972.9 million at September 30, 2023, to $975.2 million at September 30, 2024.\nThe allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, was 1.69% of outstanding loan balances, as compared to 1.70% at December 31, 2023, and 1.61% at\nSeptember 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, unfunded loan commitment reserves of $462,000 and $954,000, respectively, were\nreported in other liabilities.\nManagement believes that the loan allowance for credit losses, totaling 1.69% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, is adequate to absorb both known\nand inherent risks in the loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, regarding future economic conditions, or other circumstances, which may\nadversely affect the Company’s service areas and result in losses in the loan portfolio not captured by the current allowance for credit losses. Management is\nnot currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the Company’s loan portfolio.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s asset/liability management, liquidity strategy, and capital planning are guided by policies formulated and monitored by the Asset and Liability\nManagement Committee (ALCO) and Management, to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest-sensitive assets and\ninterest-sensitive liabilities.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on- and off-balance sheet financial obligations, including\nloan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals, without straining the Company’s equity structure. To maintain an adequate liquidity position, the\nCompany relies on, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, cash inflows from deposits and short-term borrowings, repayments of principal on loans and\ninvestments, and interest income received. The Company’s principal cash outflows are for loan originations, purchases of investment securities, depositor\nwithdrawals, and payment of operating expenses.\nThe Company’s liquid asset base, which generally consists of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities, is maintained at levels\ndeemed sufficient to provide the cash necessary to fund loan growth, unfunded loan commitments, and deposit runoff. Included in this framework is the\nobjective of maximizing the yield on earning assets. This is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans and investment\nsecurities, which typically provide higher yields than cash balances.\nThe following table sets forth asset balances as of:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance % Total Assets Balance % Total Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 47,915 3.8 % $ 40,784 3.4 %\nLoans, net of unearned income 975,151 77.7 % 920,042 76.0 %\nUnpledged investment securities 82,714 6.6 % 98,394 8.1 %\nAt September 30, 2024, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 91.56%, compared to a loan-to-deposit ratio of 91.59% at December 31, 2023.\nLiabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non-core deposits as well as short-term borrowing capabilities. Core deposits, which comprised\napproximately 87.5% of total deposits at September 30, 2024, provide a significant and stable funding source for the Company. The Bank held $30.0 million in\nborrowings from a secured credit line with the Federal Home Loan Bank and $4.0 million in borrowings from an unsecured credit line with PCBB for a total of\n$34.0 million in short-term borrowings at September 30, 2024. Unused lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB, totaling $690.4 million, were\ncollateralized by investment securities and certain qualifying loans in the Company’s portfolio. The carrying value of loans pledged on these borrowing lines\ntotaled $861.2 million at September 30, 2024. For further detail on the Company’s\n51\nTable of Contents\nborrowing arrangements, see “Note 6 - Short-term Borrowings/Other Borrowings” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe period-end balances of cash and cash equivalents for the periods shown are as follows (from Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows):\n(In thousands) Balance\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 38,595\nSeptember 30, 2023 35,297\nDecember 31, 2023 40,784\nSeptember 30, 2024 47,915\nCapital and Dividends\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n“Board of Governors”). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the\nregulatory framework, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that include quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain\noff-balance sheet items, as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital levels and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the\nregulators regarding components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nThe Company’s capital plan includes guidelines and trigger points designed to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at both the Bank and Company levels.\nCapital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines given the Bank’s level of classified assets, concentrations of credit,\nallowance for credit losses, current and projected growth, and projected retained earnings. The capital plan contains contingency strategies to obtain additional\ncapital as required to fulfill future capital requirements for both the Bank, as a separate legal entity, and the Company, on a consolidated basis. The capital plan\nrequires the Bank to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio equal to or greater than 9%. The Bank’s Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.35% and 11.42% at September 30,\n2024, and 2023, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s and the Bank’s actual capital positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nCapital Ratios:\nMinimum Minimum\nSeptember 30, Requirement to be requirement for\n2024 December 31, 2023 Well Capitalized CBLR (1)\nTier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (Leverage Ratio)\nCompany 12.44% 11.82% 5.00% 9.00%\nBank 12.35% 11.83% 5.00% 9.00%\n(1) If the Bank’s Leverage Ratio exceeds the minimum ratio under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework (CBLR), it is deemed to be “well capitalized” under all other regulatory capital\nrequirements. If the Bank’s leverage ratio falls below the minimum required, it would no longer be eligible to elect the use of the CBLR framework.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Management believes that, under the\ncurrent regulations, both the Company and the Bank will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nDividends\nDividends paid to shareholders by the Holding Company are subject to restrictions set forth under the California General Corporation Law. As applicable to the\nHolding Company, the California General Corporation Law provides that the Holding Company may make a distribution to its shareholders if either retained\nearnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal to the amount of the proposed distribution or, proceeding the distribution, the value of the\nHolding Company’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities. The primary source of funds for dividends paid to shareholders is cash\ndividends received by the Holding Company from the Bank.\n52\nTable of Contents\nOn April 25, 2017, the Board of Directors announced the authorization of the repurchase of up to $3.0 million of the outstanding stock of the Holding\nCompany. This amount represents 2.3% of total shareholders’ equity of $132.9 million at September 30, 2024. The timing of the purchases will depend on\ncertain factors including, but not limited to, market conditions and prices, available funds, and alternative uses of capital. The stock repurchase program may be\ncarried out through open-market purchases, block trades, or negotiated private transactions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company\ndid not repurchase any of the shares available.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank paid $7.8 million in cash dividends to the Holding Company which funded the Holding\nCompany’s operating costs, payments of interest on its junior subordinated debt, and dividend payments to shareholders.\nOn September 24, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend was\npayable on October 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of October 7, 2024. Approximately $2.1 million was transferred from retained earnings to dividends\npayable to allow for the distribution of the dividend to shareholders.\nThe Bank, as a state-chartered bank, is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in the California Financial Code, as administered by the Commissioner of the\nDepartment of Financial Protection and Innovation (the “Commissioner”). As applicable to the Bank, the Financial Code provides that the Bank may not pay\ncash dividends in an amount that exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the Bank or the Bank’s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount\nof distributions to the Holding Company during that period of time. If the above test is not met, cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the\nCommissioner, in an amount not exceeding the Bank’s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year. Such\nrestrictions do not apply to stock dividends, which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the Commissioner. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if the Commissioner finds that the shareholders’ equity of the Bank is not adequate or that the declaration of a dividend would be unsafe or\nunsound, the Commissioner may order the Bank not to pay any dividend. The Federal Reserve Bank may also limit dividends paid by the Bank.\nItem 3 - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThis item is not applicable to smaller reporting companies.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding\nrequired disclosures. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how\nwell-designed and executed, can provide only reasonable assurance that desired control objectives will be achieved. Management is required to apply its\njudgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of controls and procedures.\nAs of September 30, 2024, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures was carried out under the\nsupervision and participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes made to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected,\nor were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and fraud. A control\nprocedure, no matter how well conceived and executed, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure will be\nmet. Because of these inherent limitations in control\n53\nTable of Contents\nprocedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been\ndetected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can\noccur due to simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of a person, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the control. The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and\nthere can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become\ninadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degrees of compliance with policies and/or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a\ncost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

In the opinion of Management, any liability resulting from such\nproceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.\nItem 2.

The common stock of United Security\nBancshares is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “UBFO.”\nUnited Security Bank was chartered under the laws of the State of California in 1987 as a commercial bank. On June 12, 2001, United Security Bank\nreorganized into the bank holding company form of ownership and thereby became the wholly-owned subsidiary of United Security Bancshares and each share\nof United Security Bank stock was exchanged for a share of United Security Bancshares stock on a one-for-one basis. The principal business of United Security\nBancshares is to serve as the holding company for United Security Bank.\nReferences to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties. References to “we,” “us,” or the\n“Company” refer to United Security Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to the “Holding Company,” refer to United\nSecurity Bancshares, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis.\nUnited Security Bank\nThe Bank is a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Fresno, California. At December 31, 2023, the Bank operates three branches (including its main\noffice), one construction lending office, and one commercial lending office in Fresno, California and one branch each in Oakhurst, Caruthers, San Joaquin,\nFirebaugh, Coalinga, Bakersfield, Taft, Campbell, and Mendota California. The Bank has Interactive Teller Machines (ITMs) at all branch locations and nine\noff-site ITMs at non-branch locations. In addition, the Holding Company and the Bank have administrative headquarters located at 2126 Inyo Street, Fresno,\nCalifornia, 93721.\nYork Monterey Properties, Inc.\nYork Monterey Properties, Inc. (YMP) was incorporated in California on April 17, 2019, for the purpose of holding specific parcels of real estate acquired by\nthe Bank through, or in lieu of, foreclosures in Monterey County. These properties exceeded the 10-year regulatory holding period for other real estate owned,\nor “OREO.” YMP was funded with a $250,000 cash investment and the transfer of those parcels by the Bank to YMP. In December 2021, $805,000 in\nadditional funding was transferred to YMP to fund estimated expenses over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2023, these properties are included within\nthe consolidated balance sheets as part of “other real estate owned.”\nUSB Capital Trust II\nDuring July 2007, the Company formed USB Capital Trust II as a wholly-owned special purpose entity for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities.\nUSB Capital Trust II is a Variable Interest Entity and a deconsolidated entity pursuant to current accounting standards related to variable interest entities. On\nJuly 23, 2007, USB Capital Trust II issued $15 million in Trust Preferred Securities. These securities have a thirty-year maturity and bear a floating rate of\ninterest (repricing quarterly) of 1.29% over the forward 3-month SOFR rate. Interest is payable quarterly.\nConcurrent with the issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities, USB Capital Trust II used the proceeds of the Trust Preferred Securities offering to purchase a\nlike amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company. The Company pays interest on the junior subordinated debentures to USB Capital Trust\nII, which represents the sole source of dividend distributions to the holders of the Trust Preferred Securities. During 2015, $3.0 million of the $15.0 million\nprincipal balance of the subordinated debentures related to the Trust Preferred Securities was purchased by the Bank and subsequently purchased by the\nCompany from the Bank. The Company redeemed the $3.0 million in par value of the subordinated debentures, resulting in a remaining contractual principal\nbalance of $12.0 million since year-end 2015. The Company may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at any time at par.\nThe following discussion of services should be read in conjunction with “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations.”\n4\nTable of Contents\nBank Services\nThe Bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in Fresno, Madera,\nKern, and Santa Clara Counties, including a variety of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts, interest-\nbearing negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts, and time certificates of deposit. Most deposits are comprised of accounts\nfrom individuals and from small- and medium-sized, business-related sources.\nThe Bank also offers a full complement of lending products, including real estate loans, real estate construction loans, commercial and industrial loans,\nagricultural loans, and installment loans.\nReal estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property. The repayment of real estate mortgage loans generally is from the\ncash flow of the borrower. Commercial and industrial loans are diversified by industry. Loans may be originated in the Bank’s market area, purchased, or\nparticipated with other financial institutions outside the market area. A substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts\nreceivable, inventory, leases, or other collateral. The remainder are unsecured. However, extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the\nborrower to repay. Repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower. Real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential\nand commercial contractors, which are secured by single-family residential or multi-family properties. All real estate loans have established equity\nrequirements. The repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions. Agricultural loans are\ngenerally secured by land, equipment, inventory, and receivables. Repayment of agricultural loans is generally from the expected cash flow of the borrower.\nWhile the Bank has a high concentration of commercial real estate loans, it is not in the business of making residential mortgage loans to individuals. The\nresidential mortgage loan portfolio is primarily comprised of purchased fixed-rate 30-year residential mortgage pools. The Bank does not originate, or have in\nthe loan portfolio, any subprime, Alt-A, or option adjustable-rate loans. The Bank does originate interest-only loans which are generally revolving lines of\ncredit to commercial and agricultural businesses or for real estate development where the borrowers business may be seasonal or cash flows may be restricted\nuntil the completion of the project.\nLoan participations are purchased from and sold to other financial institutions. The underwriting standards for loan participations and purchases are the same as\nnon-participated loans, and are subject to the same limitations, collateral requirements, and borrower requirements.\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank makes various loan commitments, including granting customers collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit,\nand incurs certain contingent liabilities. Due to the nature of the business of the Bank’s customers, there is no absolute predictability to the utilization of unused\nloan commitments, including collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit, and, therefore, it is not possible to forecast the extent to which these\ncommitments will be exercised within the current year. While no assurance can be provided, it is not believed that any such utilization will constitute a material\nliquidity demand.\nIn addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above, the Bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs\nof commercial customers and account holders. These services include online banking, mobile banking, safe deposit boxes, wire transfers, ITM services, payroll\ndirect deposit, cashier’s checks, and cash management services. While the Bank does not operate a trust department, arrangements with correspondent banks\nfor trust services can be requested.\n5\nTable of Contents\nCompetition and Market Share\nThe banking business in California as well as the Bank’s market area is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. The Bank competes for\nloans and deposits with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, money market funds, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Bank\ncompetes for loans and deposits by offering competitive interest rates and by seeking to provide a higher level of personalized service than is generally offered\nby larger competitors. Regulatory restrictions on interstate bank branching and acquisitions and on the provision of certain financial services, such as securities\nunderwriting and insurance, have been reduced or eliminated. The availability of online and mobile banking services continues to expand. Changes in laws and\nregulations governing the financial services industry cannot be predicted; however, past legislation has served to intensify the competitive environment. Many\nof the major commercial banks operating in the Bank’s market areas offer certain services, such as trust and wealth management services, which the Bank does\nnot offer directly. In addition, banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers.\nThe Bank’s primary market areas are Fresno, Madera, Santa Clara, and Kern County, California. There are 58 FDIC-insured financial institutions competing\nfor business in those areas. The following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of June 30, 2023, which is the\nmost current information available.\nRank Share\nFresno County 9th 4.24%\nMadera County 4th 8.40%\nKern County 14th 0.68%\nSanta Clara County 40th 0.01%\nTotal of Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties 20th 0.33%\nSupervision and Regulation\nBanking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Federal and state laws and the regulations of the federal and state bank regulatory agencies govern most\naspects of a bank’s business, including capital adequacy ratios, reserves against deposits, limitations on the nature and amount of loans which may be made, the\nlocation of branch offices, borrowings, and dividends. The primary goals of banking laws and regulations are to maintain a safe and sound banking system, to\nprotect depositors and the FDIC’s insurance fund, and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of these goals, Congress and the States\nhave created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks, bank holding companies, and the financial services\nindustry. Consequently, the growth and earnings performance of the Company and the Bank can be affected not only by management decisions and general\neconomic conditions, but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes, regulations, and the policies of various governmental regulatory\nauthorities, including:\n• The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC,\n• The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, or DFPI,\n• The Federal Reserve Board, or FRB.\nChanges in applicable law or regulations, and in their application by the regulatory agencies, whether as the result of changes in the political climate or\notherwise, cannot be predicted and may have a material effect on the business, operations, and financial results of the Company or the Bank.\nDescribed below are elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to the Company and/or the Bank. The descriptions are not intended to be complete\nand are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described.\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”),which was enacted in 2010, significantly revised and expanded the\nrulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory agencies. The numerous rules and regulations being promulgated pursuant to\nthe Dodd-Frank Act are impacting banks’ operations and compliance costs. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include:\n• revisions in the deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance and the permanent increase in deposit insurance coverage to $250,000;\n6\nTable of Contents\n• reduced interchange fees on debit card transactions;\n• interest payments on business checking accounts;\n• the removal of barriers to interstate branching;\n• and required disclosure and shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation.\nOther provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include:\n• Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act: increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets; created a\nnew category and required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio for “common equity Tier 1” as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity;\nestablished a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio set at 4.00%, eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks; changed the permitted\ncomposition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities (unless issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than\n$15 billion in assets), mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and included unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt\nand equity securities; added an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios,\nwhich must be met to avoid limitations on the ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses; changed the risk weights\nof certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and\nconstruction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures.\n• Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average\nconsolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio\nof the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35% of insured deposits and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository\ninstitutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.\n• Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid\nto executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion.\n• Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank\nchartered by that state would be permitted to branch.\n• Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau (CFPB), which has been granted broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial\nprotection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting\nAct, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the GLBA, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has\nexamination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are\nsubject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but are still examined and supervised by their federal banking regulators for consumer compliance\npurposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial\nproducts. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including\na determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if\nthey receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Dodd- Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer\nprotection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys\ngeneral to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.\n• Final Volcker Rule. In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implemented a part of the Dodd-Frank Act\ncommonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” The final rules were amended in October 2019. Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions,\nbanking entities, including the Bank, are restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or\ninvesting in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered “covered funds.” Banks that do not have significant\ntrading activities, such as the Bank, will be assumed to operate under a presumption of compliance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also resulted in the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council to oversee and coordinate the\nefforts of the primary U.S financial regulatory agencies in establishing regulations to address financial stability matters.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted under the administration of former President Barack Obama. The subsequent administration under President Donald Trump\nsought to roll-back key pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act in an effort to loosen regulatory restrictions on financial institutions including, but not limited to, easing\nthe “Volker Rule,” stress tests, and other constraints on\n7\nTable of Contents\nfinancial institutions. The Biden administration has expressed a commitment to reemphasize restrictions on financial institutions which were loosened during\nthe previous administration. The Company cannot predict which provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be repealed, put in to effect, delayed, or enforced and,\ntherefore, cannot predict the effect, if any, that the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder or actions initiated by the Biden administration will\nhave on its future results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\nGeneral\nThe Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is registered with, and regulated\nand examined by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or FRB. The Company is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC) and to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In addition, as the Company lists its common stock on Nasdaq, it is subject to the listing standards\nand rules of Nasdaq.\nDodd-Frank Act\nThe Dodd-Frank Act codified existing FRB policy requiring the Company to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank, and to commit resources to\nsupport the Bank in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. However, because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) provides for functional\nregulation of financial holding company activities by various regulators, the GLBA prohibits the FRB from requiring payment by a holding company to a\ndepository institution if the functional regulator of the depository institution objects to the payment. In those cases, the FRB could instead require the\ndivestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, non-bank subsidiaries of a\nholding company that engage in activities permissible for an insured depository institution must be examined and regulated in a manner that are at least as\nstringent as if the activities were conducted by the lead depository institution of the holding company.\nBank Holding Company Liquidity\nAs a legal entity, separate and distinct from the Bank, the Company must rely on its own resources to pay its operating expenses and dividends to its\nshareholders. In addition to raising capital on its own behalf or borrowing from external sources, the Company may also obtain funds from dividends paid by,\nand fees charged for services provided to, the Bank. However, statutory and regulatory constraints on the Bank may restrict or totally preclude the payment of\ndividends by the Bank to the Company.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nThe Company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the Bank within the meaning of Sections 23A and 23B of the\nFederal Reserve Act, and the FRB’s Regulation W. Under Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W, loans by the Bank to affiliates, investments by them in\naffiliates’ stock, and taking affiliates’ stock as collateral for loans to any borrower is limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital, in the case of any one affiliate, and is\nlimited to 20% of the Bank’s capital, in the case of all affiliates. In addition, transactions between the Bank and any affiliates must be on terms and conditions\nthat are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for\ncomparable transactions with or involving non-affiliates. In particular, a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low-quality\nasset, as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. These restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and a bank subsidiary’s other affiliates from borrowing\nfrom the bank subsidiary unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts.\nThe Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities.\nThe Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation O place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank or bank holding company’s\nexecutive officers, directors and principal shareholders; any company controlled by any such executive officer, director or shareholder; or any political or\ncampaign committee controlled by such executive officer, director or principal shareholder. Additionally, such loans or extensions of credit must comply with\nloan-to-one-borrower limits; require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts; must be made on\nsubstantially the same and follow credit-underwriting procedures no less stringent than those prevailing at the time for\n8\nTable of Contents\ncomparable transactions with non-insiders; must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment, or present other unfavorable features; and must not\nexceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus in the aggregate.\nLimitations on Business and Investment Activities\nUnder the BHCA, a bank holding company must obtain the FRB’s approval before: (i) directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5% ownership or control of\nany voting shares of another bank or bank holding company; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank; (iii) or merging or consolidating\nwith another bank holding company.\nThe FRB may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited\nby the law of the state in which the target bank is located. In approving interstate acquisitions however, the FRB must give effect to applicable state laws\nlimiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which\nthe target bank is located, provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies, and state laws\nwhich require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, before being acquired by an out-of-state bank\nholding company.\nIn addition to owning or managing banks, bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the FRB has determined to be “so\nclosely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.” The Holding Company, therefore, is permitted to engage in a variety of banking-related\nbusinesses.\nAdditionally, qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the FRB may engage in a full range of financial activities, including\ninsurance, securities, and merchant banking. The Company has not elected to qualify for these financial services.\nFederal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of\ncredit. Thus, for example, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the\nforegoing on the condition that:\n• the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the Bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust\nservices;\n• the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or service from or to the Company or any subsidiaries; or\n• the customer must not obtain some other credit, property, or services from competitors, except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit\nextended.\nCapital Adequacy\nBank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines. If capital falls below minimum\nguideline levels, a bank holding company, among other things, may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses.\nThe FRB’s risk-based capital adequacy guidelines, discussed in more detail below in the section entitled “The Bank - Capital Standards,” assign various risk\npercentages or weights to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the terms of the guidelines, bank\nholding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk-weighted assets and on total assets, without regard to risk weights.\nThe risk-based guidelines are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of\nindividual organizations. For example, the FRB’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among\nother things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Moreover, any banking\norganization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities, particularly under the expanded powers under the GLBA, would\nbe expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.\nLimitations on Dividend Payments\nAs applicable to the Company, California Corporations Code Section 500 provides that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall make a\ndistribution to the Company’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith that either:\n9\nTable of Contents\n• The amount of retained earnings of the Company immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed\ndistribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or\n• Immediately after the distribution, the value of the Company’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights\namount.\nAdditionally, the FRB’s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income for the past\nyear or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also possesses\nenforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or\nviolations of applicable statutes and regulations.\nSecurities Registration and Listing\nThe Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act and, as a result, is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider\ntrading, corporate governance, and other disclosure requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Securities Act, both administered by the\nSEC. The Company is required to file annual, quarterly and other current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site, http://www.sec.gov, where\nSEC filings may be accessed. The SEC filings are also available on the Bank’s website at http://investors.unitedsecuritybank.com/Docs.\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on Nasdaq and trades under the symbol “UBFO.” The Company is subject to Nasdaq standards for listed companies.\nNasdaq has adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance\nof companies and their directors.\nThe Bank\nGeneral\nAs a California state-chartered bank and a member of the FRB, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the FRB and the\nDFPI. The Bank is subject to California laws insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to the\napplicable limits in an amount up to $250,000 per customer and, as such, the Bank is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act\nand the regulations of the FDIC. As a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in California and the United States, the Bank’s\nbusiness is particularly susceptible to changes in California and federal legislation and regulation, which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing\nbusiness, limiting permissible activities or increasing competition.\nCapital Standards\nFederal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including the Bank, to maintain adequate capital based on the size, asset composition, and\ncomplexity of the institution. Generally, FDIC-insured depository institutions must maintain several minimum capital ratios: a common equity tier 1 capital to\nrisk-based assets ratio; a tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a total capital to risk-based assets; and a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These ratios\ninvolve complex calculations of various categories of capital and various categories of assets. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain\nmandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the institution’s financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nEffective January 1, 2020, pursuant to the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in May 2018, the Federal regulatory\nagencies adopted simplified capital requirements for certain qualifying “community” banking organizations. Depository institutions and depository institution\nholding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio (equal to tier 1\ncapital divided by average total consolidated assets) of greater than 9 percent, are eligible to opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework. Qualifying\ncommunity banking organizations that elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintain a leverage ratio of greater than 9 percent\nare considered to have satisfied the applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements in the agencies’ capital rules and are considered to have met the\n“well capitalized” ratio requirements. Institutions that cease meeting the qualifying criteria have two calendar quarters within which to re-qualify, so long as the\ninstitution maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 8 percent during the grace period.\nThe Company and the Bank met the criteria and adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework during 2020.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank were “well capitalized” under the applicable standards. The actual capitalization ratios for the Bank and\nthe Company as of December 31, 2023 can be found at “Note 21 - Regulatory Matters” to the consolidated financial statements.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the\nproblems of insured depository institutions, including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. Pursuant to\nFDICIA, the FRB promulgated regulations defining the following five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level\nof its capital ratios:\nUnder the regulations, a bank shall be deemed to be:\n• “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, has a common equity\nTier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more, has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5% or more, and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and\nmaintain a specific capital level for any capital measure;\n• “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or more and a leverage capital\nratio of 4% or more (3% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized”;\n• “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, or a leverage\ncapital ratio that is less than 4% (3% under certain circumstances);\n• “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3% or a\nleverage capital ratio that is less than 3%; and\n• “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.\nA bank’s category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate\nrepresentation of the bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.\nWhile these benchmarks have not changed, due to market turbulence, the regulators have strongly encouraged and, in many instances, required, banks and bank\nholding companies to achieve and maintain higher ratios as a matter of safety and soundness.\nBanks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if, after making the payment, the bank would be\n“undercapitalized,” that is, the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure. Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to\n“undercapitalized” banks. Banks classified as “undercapitalized” are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company, if any.\nBroad regulatory authority was granted with respect to “significantly undercapitalized” banks, including forced mergers, growth restrictions, ordering new\nelections for directors, forcing divestiture by its holding company, if any, requiring management changes, and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior\nmanagement. Even more severe restrictions are applicable to “critically undercapitalized” banks. Restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a\nreceiver or conservator. All of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective\naction.\nA bank, based upon its capital levels, that is classified as “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” may be treated as though it were in\nthe next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound\ncondition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. Further, a bank that otherwise meets the capital levels to be categorized as “well\ncapitalized,” will be deemed to be “adequately capitalized,” if the bank is subject to a written agreement requiring that the bank maintain specific capital levels.\nAt each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions. The federal banking agencies, however, may not treat an institution as\n“critically undercapitalized” unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment.\nBanking organizations that meet the criteria and have adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework, such as the Company and the Bank, are deemed\nto be “well capitalized” for “prompt corrective action” purposes.\nIn addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, commercial banking organizations, such as the Bank, may be subject to potential\nenforcement actions by the federal or state banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule,\nregulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the imposition of a\nconservator or receiver, the issuance of a cease‑and‑desist order that can be judicially enforced, the termination of insurance for deposits (in the case of a\n11\nTable of Contents\ndepository institution), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, the issuance of formal and informal agreements,\nand the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution‑affiliated parties.\nBrokered Deposit Restrictions\nWell-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over\nbrokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the rate paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are\ngenerally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank was deemed to be “well-capitalized” and,\ntherefore, eligible to accept brokered deposits.\nLimitations on Dividend Payments\nCalifornia law restricts the amount available for cash dividends the Bank may pay to the Company. Under California law, funds available for cash dividend\npayments by a bank are restricted to the lesser of: (1) retained earnings; or (2) the bank’s net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to\nshareholders made during such period). Cash dividends may also be paid out of the greater of: (i) net income for a bank’s last preceding fiscal year; (ii) a\nbank’s retained earnings; or (iii) net income for a bank’s current fiscal year, upon the prior approval of the DFPI. If the DFPI finds that the stockholders’ equity\nof a bank is not adequate or that the payment of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound for the bank, the DFPI may order the bank not to pay any dividends.\nPremiums for Deposit Insurance\nThe FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per qualified account. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system to set quarterly insurance premium\nassessments which categorizes banks into four risk categories based on capital levels and supervisory “CAMELS” ratings and names them Risk Categories I,\nII, III and IV. The CAMELS rating system is based upon an evaluation of the six critical elements of an institution’s operations: Capital adequacy, Asset\nquality, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity to risk. This rating system is designed to take into account and reflect all significant financial and\noperational factors financial institution examiners assess in their evaluation of an institution’s performance.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act required the FDIC to maintain a reserve ratio of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund at not less than 1.35% of insured\ndeposits and to adopt a restoration plan to achieve the statutory minimum within 8 years if the ratio falls below 1.35%. During 2020 the reserve ratio fell below\n1.35% to 1.30% due to extraordinary growth in insured deposits and, accordingly, in September 2020, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan providing for FDIC\nmonitoring deposit balance trends, potential losses, and other factors that affect the reserve ratio, while maintaining the current schedule of assessment rates for\nall insured institutions. Under the restoration plan, the FDIC is to provide updates at least semi-annually. In setting the assessments, the FDIC is required to\noffset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Assessments are based\non the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits. The semi-annual update\nas of March 31, 2022, showed a decline of four basis points to 1.23%. As a result, on October 20, 2022, the FDIC adopted an amendment to the restoration plan\nresulting in a uniform increase in the base deposit insurance assessment of two basis points beginning with the first quarter of 2023 in order to meet the\nrequirement of 1.35% by September 30, 2028. On November 16, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to\nthe Deposit Insurance Fund associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Under the final\nrule, the assessment base for an insured depository institution will be equal to the institution’s estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted\nto exclude the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits.\nThe FDIC is authorized to terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe\nor unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or\nimposed by the institution’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance would result in the forced closure of the Bank which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSafety and Soundness Standards\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and\nsoundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to: (i) internal controls,\ninformation systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) asset growth; (v) earnings; and (vi) compensation, fees\nand benefits. In addition, the federal\n12\nTable of Contents\nbanking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards. These guidelines provide nine\nstandards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB-SF). Among other benefits, each Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) serves as\na reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB\nsystem. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of\nthe individual FHLB. The FHLB-SF utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of $100 per share, which may be issued, exchanged, redeemed and\nrepurchased only at par value. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own FHLB –SF capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of:\n• a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of $25 million (100% of “membership asset value” as defined), or\n• an activity-based stock requirement (based on percentage of outstanding advances).\nThe FHLB – SF capital stock is redeemable with five year’s written notice, subject to certain conditions. At December 31, 2023, the Bank owned 67,374 shares\nof the FHLB-SF capital stock valued at $6,737,400.\nFederal Reserve Bank\nThe FRB no longer requires depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non-\npersonal time deposits.\nAs a member of the Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank is required to subscribe to the stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in an amount equal to\n6% of the Bank’s capital and surplus of which 3% must be paid in and 3% is subject to call by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Capital\nstock shares may not be transferred or hypothecated. The capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank is divided into shares of $100 each.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Bank owned 38,567 shares of FRB-SF stock with paid-in capital totaling $1,929,850.\nConsumer Regulation\nThe Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern relationships with customers. These laws include\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt\nCollection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws\nregarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation\nbrought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal bank regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer\nprotection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer\nrescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with\nconsumer protection regulations may result in the failure to obtain required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions or other transactions\nwhere approval is not required.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB is also authorized\nto engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved\nconsumers and communities. The CFPB has broad supervisory, examination, and enforcement authority over various consumer financial products and services,\nincluding the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations and to impose significant penalties, as well as\ninjunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB also has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders\nproviding for affirmative relief or monetary penalties. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, on November 29, 2021, the DFPI proposed rules under the California Consumer Financial\nProtection Law to allow the DFPI to require businesses that provide financial products such as debt settlement, student debt relief, education financing, and\nwage-based advances to register with the DFPI and provide records to facilitate the oversight of the registrants in their interaction\n13\nTable of Contents\nwith consumers in California. The DFPI’s expanding its authority to have an increased emphasis on consumer protection that may be viewed as an effort to\ncreate a state-run equivalent of the CFPB.\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nThe PATRIOT Act, designed to deny terrorists and others the ability to obtain access to the United States financial system, has significant implications for\ndepository institutions, brokers, dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The PATRIOT Act, as implemented by various federal\nregulatory agencies, requires the Company and the Bank to establish and implement policies and procedures with respect to, among other matters, anti‑money\nlaundering, compliance, suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers and prospective customers. The PATRIOT Act\nand its underlying regulations permit information sharing for counter‑terrorist purposes between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as\nwell as among financial institutions, subject to certain conditions, and require the FRB, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies to evaluate the\neffectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering activities when considering a bank holding company acquisition and/or a bank merger.\nThe Bank regularly evaluates and continues to enhance the systems and procedures to continue to comply with the PATRIOT Act and other anti‑money\nlaundering initiatives. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to\ncomply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational consequences for the institution and result in material\nfines and sanctions.\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING ACT OF 2020\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AML Act) was enacted effective January 1, 2021 and presents the most comprehensive revisions and enhancements\nto anti-money laundering and counter terrorism laws since the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001\n(BSA). The impact of the new legislation will not be fully known until required regulations are adopted and implemented, but the AML Act represents\nsignificant changes and reaffirms and broadens the government’s oversight and commitment to addressing the illicit activities and financing of terrorism.\nMany of the provisions of the AML Act deal with the operations of the federal agencies primarily responsible for addressing terrorism financing and the\nsafeguarding of the national security of the United States, such as the U.S. Treasury and its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), including the\nrequirement for FinCEN to engage anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing investigations experts and the requirement to facilitate information\nsharing with other federal and state and even foreign law enforcement agencies. On June 30, 2021, FinCEN issued the first government-wide priorities for anti-\nmoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism to encourage banks to incorporate the priorities into their risk-based BSA compliance programs.\nThe priorities identified were:\n• (i) corruption;\n• (ii) cybercrime and cybersecurity;\n• (iii) terrorist financing;\n• (iv) fraud;\n• (v) transnational crime organizations;\n• (vi) drug trafficking;\n• (vii) human trafficking; and\n• (viii) proliferation financing through support networks.\nThe AML Act also expands the reach of federal AML laws by extending their applicability to a broader range of industries, such as entities involved in futures,\nprecious metals, precious stones and jewels, antiquities, and cryptocurrency. On September 24, 2021, FinCEN issued proposed rules to include a person\nengaged in the trade of antiquities under the definition of “financial institution” subjecting such person to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the\nTreasury.\nThe AML Act aims to balance the burdens imposed by reporting on financial institutions and the benefits derived by Federal law enforcement agencies. The\nAML Act requires a review of currency transaction and suspicious activity reports submitted by financial institutions to determine to what extent the reporting\ncan be streamlined and made more useful. Included is the obligation to review the dollar thresholds for reporting currency transactions and to establish\nautomated processes for filing simple, non-complex categories of reports. It calls for greater integration between financial institution systems and the electronic\nfiling system to allow for automatic population of report fields and the submission of transaction data.\nOther provisions of the AML Act enhance enforcement. The Act provides protection for financial institutions keeping open a customer’s account or transaction\nat the request of a federal law enforcement agency or at the request of a state or local agency with the concurrence of FinCEN and increases civil penalties for\nfinancial institutions and persons violating the recordkeeping\n14\nTable of Contents\nand reporting obligations. Persons found to have committed repeated “egregious violations” may be barred from serving on boards of directors of financial\ninstitutions and fined in an amount that is equal to the profit gained by such person by reason of such violation. If that person is a partner, director, officer or\nemployee of a financial institution, that person may be ordered to repay any bonus paid to that person, irrespective of the amount of the bonus or how it was\ncalculated. New criminal penalties have been created for concealing from or misrepresenting to a financial institution any material facts concerning:\n• (i) the ownership or control of assets involved in a monetary transaction involving a senior foreign political figure in amounts exceeding $1 million; or\n• (ii) the source of funds in a monetary transaction involving an entity found to be a primary money laundering concern.\nThe AML Act also authorize the Treasury to pay whistleblower awards leading to fines or forfeitures of at least $50,000 up to the lower of $150,000 or 25% of\nthe fine or forfeiture and allows for the payment to whistleblowers of up to 30% of the fine or forfeiture.\nOne of the most significant portions of the AML Act is The Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), which will requires the reporting of certain information\nregarding “beneficial owners” of “reporting companies” to a confidential FinCEN database. Reporting companies are defined as any corporation, limited\nliability company or other entity formed in the U.S. under the laws of a state or Indian Tribe or registered as a foreign entity to do business in the U.S., other\nthan those specifically excluded, such as:\n• (i) companies reporting or with a class of securities registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1934;\n• (ii) banks, bank holding companies, and credit unions;\n• (iii) money transmitters, registered broker‑dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies;\n• (iv) public utilities and insurance companies;\n• (v) 503(c)(3) entities;\n• (vi) entities that employ more than 20 employees, have reported gross receipts or sales to the Internal Revenue Service in excess of $5.0 million in the\nprior year, and have an operating presence in the U.S.; and\n• (vii) certain “inactive” entities.\nA beneficial owner is any individual who directly, or indirectly exercises substantial control over an entity or owns or controls 25% or more of the ownership\ninterest of an entity. The reporting company is required to provide FinCEN with the legal name, date of birth, current resident or business address, and an\nacceptable identification number of the beneficial owner. In 2022, FinCEN issued a final rule requiring the reporting of beneficial ownership information by\nentities “created” or “doing business” in the United States before January 1, 2024, beginning January 1, 2025.\nUnder the CTA, the Treasury is to minimize the burden on reporting companies and ensure the information deposited in the database is maintained in the\nstrictest confidence and made available for inspection or disclosure by FinCEN only for the purposes set forth in the AML Act and only to:\n• (i) federal agencies engaged in national security, intelligence or law enforcement;\n• (ii) state, local or Tribal law enforcement agencies, subject to authorization by a court of competent jurisdiction;\n• (iii) financial institutions subject to customer due diligence requirements with the consent of the reporting company;\n• (iv) requests by a federal or other appropriate regulatory agency;\n• (v) certain Treasury officials for tax administration purposes;\n• (vi) authorized federal agencies on behalf of a properly recognized foreign authority.\nDuring 2022, FinCEN issued proposed regulations for a pilot program to permit financial institutions to share suspicious activity information with their foreign\nbranches, subsidiaries and affiliates to combat illicit finance risks under the AML Act.\nThe foregoing is only a summary of selected provisions of the AML Act. Given that regulations implementing the new AML Act are being proposed but have\nnot yet been adopted or implemented, the Company cannot determine at this time the effect, if any, the AML Act will have on the Company’s future results of\noperations or financial condition.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) Regulation\nThe United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, designated nationals, and others. These rules are\nbased on their administration by OFAC. The OFAC‑administered sanctions targeting designated countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they\ncontain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or\nindirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments\nin, or providing investment‑related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in\n15\nTable of Contents\nwhich the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S.\njurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn,\nset off, or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, strategic, and reputational\nconsequences, and result in civil money penalties on the Company and the Bank.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) generally requires the Bank to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products,\nmake donations in, and provide services designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires the Bank to maintain comprehensive\nrecords of its CRA activities to demonstrate how we are meeting the credit needs of the Bank’s communities. These documents are subject to periodic\nexamination by the FRB. During these examinations, the FRB rates such institutions’ compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to\nImprove” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the FRB to take into account the record of a bank in meeting the credit needs of all of the\ncommunities served, including low‑ and moderate‑income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a\n“Satisfactory” rating could inhibit such institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA\nrating of “Satisfactory” as of its most recent examination. In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company, when applying to acquire a bank,\nsavings association, or a bank holding company, the FRB will assess the CRA record of each depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in\nconsidering the application.\nCustomer Information Privacy and Cybersecurity\nThe FRB and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal, and non‑public customer information. These\nguidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to\ncreate, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer\ninformation, protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information, and protect against unauthorized access to or use\nof such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We have adopted a customer information security program to\ncomply with these requirements.\nIn March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design\nmultiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised\ncustomer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other\nstatement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid\nrecovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected\nto develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the\ninstitution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various\nregulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.\nIn July 2023, the SEC adopted new rules to enhance and standardize disclosures regarding cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incidents\nby public companies. There are two main components:\n• Material cybersecurity incidents must be filed on Form 8-K within four business days of a determination that a cybersecurity incident is material.\n• Annual disclosure of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance must be disclosed on Form 10-K. The Company’s cybersecurity\ndisclosure can be found in Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\nPrivacy\nThe GLBA and the California Financial Information Privacy Act require financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of\nnon-public personal information about consumers to non‑affiliated third parties. In general, the statutes require disclosures to consumers on policies and\nprocedures regarding the disclosure of such non-public personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibit disclosing such information\nexcept as provided in the Bank’s policies and procedures. We have implemented privacy policies addressing these restrictions that are distributed regularly to\nall existing and new customers of the Bank.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOther Aspects of Banking Law\nThe Bank is subject to federal statutory and regulatory provisions covering, among other things, security procedures, management interlocks, funds availability\nand truth-in-savings. There are also a variety of federal statutes that regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies, and the\nactivities beyond owning banks that are permissible.\nMoreover, additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before Congress, the California Legislature, and other government bodies in the future which, if\nenacted, may further alter the structure, regulation, and competitive relationship among financial institutions and may subject the bank holding companies and\nbanks to increased supervision and disclosure, compliance costs and reporting requirements. In addition, the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new\nrules and regulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation. Bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in responding to concerns\nand trends identified in examinations, and this has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement actions to financial institutions requiring action to address\ncredit quality, liquidity and risk management, capital adequacy, compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as other safety and soundness concerns.\nIt cannot be predicted whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the extent to which the Bank’s\nbusinesses would be affected thereby. In addition, the outcome of examinations, any litigation, or any investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may\nresult in necessary changes in the Bank’s operations and increased compliance costs.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company employed 114 full-time equivalent staff as of December 31, 2023. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit, and the\nCompany believes its relationship with its employees is good.\nThe Company’s ability to attract, retain, and develop employees is a key to its success. We provide competitive pay that is consistent with the employee’s\nposition and experience. Annual increases in compensation are based on merit, which is documented throughout internal systems and communicated at the time\nof review and upon promotion or transfer. Certain employees participate in the Company’s performance-based incentive programs, which may include\nadditional bonus and incentive compensation and equity-based awards. Certain benefits are subject to eligibility, vesting, and performance requirements.\nEmployee performance is measured formally at least annually.\nOur employees’ health, wellness, and safety are a priority to the Company. Employees receive a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid time off,\nsick time, Company matching contributions of 100% up to 4% of salary contributions to a qualified retirement plan, and other health and wellness benefits\nincluding participation in Company paid or subsidized medical, dental, term-life, accidental death and dismemberment, long-term disability insurance, and\nemployee assistance programs.\nThe Company’s code of ethics prohibits discrimination or harassment. The Company requires all employees to agree to the code of ethics and participate in\nharassment prevention training annually.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company files periodic reports and other reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports,\nas well as the Company’s Code of Ethics, are posted and are available at no cost on the Company’s website at http://www.unitedsecuritybank.com as soon as\nreasonably practical after the Company files such reports with the SEC. The Company’s periodic and other reports filed with the SEC are also available at the\nSEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov).\nItem 1A - Risk Factors\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 1B - Unresolved Staff Comments\nThe Company had no unresolved staff comments at December 31, 2023.\n17\nTable of Contents\nItem 1C - Cybersecurity\n• Management of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, United Security Bank (Bank), reports to the Board of Directors, or an appropriate\ncommittee of the board, at least annually. This report describes the overall status of the information security program and the Bank’s compliance with\nthese guidelines.\n• The report discusses material matters related to the information security program, addressing issues such as: risk assessment; risk management and\ncontrol decisions; service provider arrangements; results of testing; security breaches or violations and management’s responses; and\nrecommendations for changes in the information security program.\n• The intent of this report is to communicate the overall status of the information security program, including any updates to the program components.\n• In regard to cybersecurity threats and controls, the information security program addresses the Bank’s cybersecurity strategy.\n• Cybersecurity is an element of information security. Information security deals with information, regardless of its format – paper documents, digital\nand intellectual property, and verbal or visual communications.\n• Cybersecurity focuses on protecting digital assets from intentional attacks. These assets include networks, computer hardware/software, and\ninformation that is processed, stored, or transported by networked systems and devices.\n• The Information Security Program was initially designed, and is regularly updated, to comply with the following laws and regulations:\n◦ The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) regarding protection of nonpublic personal information,\n◦ The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards,”\n◦ Supplemental federal and state banking regulations and guidelines regarding protection of nonpublic customer information, as applicable to\nthis program.\n• Oversight of the Bank’s cybersecurity program is the responsibility of the IT Committee of the Board of Directors. This committee is also responsible\nfor approving the program’s budget and staffing. Management of the program is the responsibility of the Bank’s information security officer.\n• To ensure appropriate segregation of duties, the information security officer is independent of IT operations staff and reports to the Bank’s chief risk\nofficer. The information security officer is responsible for responding to security events by ordering emergency actions to protect the institution and its\ncustomers from imminent loss of information; managing the negative effects on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or value of information; and\nminimizing the disruption or degradation of critical services.\n• The IT Committee of the Board of Directors meets bi-monthly, or as needed, to review risks resulting from cybersecurity threats.\n• Testing is conducted annually using external third-party penetration testing and internal vulnerability assessments.\nWhile cybersecurity risks have the potential to materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, the Company does not\nbelieve that risks from cybersecurity threats or attacks, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected the Company,\nincluding its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However, the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and the\nCompany’s cybersecurity risk management and strategy may be insufficient or may not be successful in protecting against all cyber incidents. Accordingly, no\nmatter how well designed or implemented the Company’s controls are, it will not be able to anticipate all cyber security breaches, preventative measures cannot\nprovide absolute security and may not be sufficient in all circumstances or mitigate all potential risks, and the Company may not be able to implement effective\npreventive measures against cyber security breaches in a timely manner.\nItem 2 - Properties\nThe Company provides traditional banking services through twelve branches and two loan production offices located primarily throughout California’s Central\nValley. Bank branches are located in Fresno, Madera, Kern, and Santa Clara Counties. The Company also has nine remote ITM locations. Both loan production\noffices are housed at branch facilities in Fresno County. The administration building is located in Fresno, California, and does not provide branch services.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held leases for six of the branches and the nine remote ITM locations, and owned the remaining six branches. The\nCompany also owns its headquarters in Fresno, California. Most of the leases have renewal options and, in management’s opinions, all properties are\nadequately covered by insurance. The Company considers its existing facilities to be sufficient for current and future use. Please see “Note 5 - Premises and\nequipment” and “Note 9 - Leases” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further detail.\n18\nTable of Contents\nItem 3 - Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. At this time, the Company is not aware of\nany pending legal proceedings to which it is a party or of which any of its property is the subject, nor is the Company aware of any such proceedings known to\nbe contemplated by governmental entities, which proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the\nCompany.\nItem 4 - Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5 - Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTrading History\nThe Company’s common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and is traded under the symbol UBFO.

Dividends paid\nto shareholders are subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law, which provides that a California corporation may make a\ndistribution, including paying dividends on its capital stock, from retained earnings to the extent that the retained earnings exceed (a) the amount of the\nproposed distribution plus (b) the amount, if any, of dividends in arrears on shares with preferential dividend rights. Alternatively, a California corporation may\nmake a distribution, if, immediately after the distribution, the value of its assets equals or exceeds the sum of (a) its total liabilities plus (b) the liquidation\npreference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the distribution. As a bank holding company\nwithout significant assets other than its equity position in the Bank, the ability to pay dividends to shareholders depends primarily upon dividends received\nfrom the Bank. Such dividends paid by the Bank to the Company are subject to certain limitations. See “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial and Results of Operations - Regulatory Matters.”\n19\nTable of Contents\nCash dividends declared during 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2023 2022\nDate Declared Date Paid Dividend Amount Date Declared Date Paid Dividend Amount\nMarch 28, 2023 April 21, 2023 $0.11 March 22, 2022 April 18, 2022 $0.11\nJune 27, 2023 July 24, 2023 $0.12 June 28, 2022 July 22, 2022 $0.11\nSeptember 26, 2023 October 25, 2023 $0.12 September 27, 2022 October 25, 2022 $0.11\nDecember 18, 2023 January 19, 2024 $0.12 December 20, 2022 January 19, 2023 $0.11\nThe amount and payment of dividends to our shareholders are set by the Board of Directors with numerous factors being taken into consideration including but\nnot limited to earnings, financial condition, and the need for capital for expanded growth and general economic conditions. No assurance can be given that cash\nor stock dividends will be paid in the future.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nThe following table sets forth securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2023.

Restricted\nstock awards and restricted stock units are not included in the total in column (a). At December 31, 2023, there were 14,435 unvested restricted stock awards\nand 7,000 shares of restricted stock units issued and outstanding.\nA complete description of the above plans is included in “Item 8 - Note 12 - Stock-Based Compensation to the Consolidated Financial Statements,” and is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company issued 169 fully vested shares of its common stock to a former non-employee director in lieu of cash compensation for\ndirectors’ fees. This grant reflects director compensation for a portion of the second quarter of 2023. The number of shares received in lieu of cash was\ncalculated based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2023, which was $7.21 per share. The shares of common stock issued\nto the former non-employee director contain a Rule 144 restrictive legend and are exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act\nof 1933, as amended, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.\nWe believed that Section 4(a)(2) was available because: (i) the issuance did not involve underwriters, underwriting discounts, or commissions, (ii) the shares\nissued are restricted stock with transfer restrictions, (iii) no sales were made by general solicitation or advertising, and (iv) the sales were made to an accredited\ninvestor.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nOn April 25, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $3 million of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The\nduration of the program is open-ended and the timing of purchases will depend on market conditions. The Company did not repurchase any common shares\nunder the stock repurchase plan during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n20\nTable of Contents\nItem 6 - [Reserved]\nItem 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes included in this report.\nOverview\nThe Company\nUnited Security Bancshares, a California corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the BHCA with corporate headquarters located in Fresno,\nCalifornia. The principal business of United Security Bancshares is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary, United Security Bank.\nReferences to the “Bank” refer to United Security Bank together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. References to the\n“Company” refer to United Security Bancshares together with its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. References to the “Holding Company” refer to United\nSecurity Bancshares, the parent company, on a stand-alone basis. The Bank currently has twelve banking branches, which provide banking services in Fresno,\nMadera, Kern, and Santa Clara counties in the state of California. In addition to full-service branches, the Bank has several stand-alone ITM machines within\nits geographic footprint.\nExecutive Summary\nDuring 2023, the Company focussed on its strategy of serving the banking needs of its customers and retaining deposit balances in a competitive deposit rate\nenvironment.\n2023 Financial Summary and 2022 Comparison\n▪ Net income increased to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $15.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n▪ Loan interest income increased $11.1 million to $54.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n▪ Total assets decreased 6.8% to $1.21 billion, compared to $1.30 billion at December 31, 2022.\n▪ Total loans, net of unearned fees, decreased 6.1% to $920.0 million, compared to $980.2 million at December 31, 2022.\n▪ Total investments decreased 12.4%, or $26.2 million, to $184.6 million, compared to $210.9 million at December 31, 2022.\n▪ Total deposits decreased 13.8% to $1.00 billion, compared to $1.17 billion at December 31, 2022.\n▪ The total fair value of the junior subordinated debentures (TRUPs) changed by $270,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023.

One of the primary strategic goals of the Company is to maintain a mix of assets that will\ngenerate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk, and to finance those assets with a low-cost and stable source of funds. Liquidity and capital resources\nmust also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth.\nBecause the Bank primarily conducts banking operations in California’s Central Valley, its operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic\ncondition of the Central Valley. Our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate\nactivity in the Central Valley, and declines in economic conditions can have adverse material effects upon the Bank. In addition, the Central Valley remains\nlargely dependent on agriculture. A downturn in agriculture and agricultural-related business could indirectly and adversely affect the Company as many\nborrowers and customers are involved in, or are impacted to some extent by, the agricultural industry. While a great number of our borrowers are not directly\ninvolved in agriculture, they would likely be impacted by difficulties in the agricultural industry since many jobs in our market areas are ancillary to the regular\nproduction, processing, marketing and sale of agricultural commodities. The agricultural industry has been affected by declines in prices and changes in yields\nof various crops and other agricultural commodities. Weaker prices could reduce the cash flows generated by farms and the value of agricultural land in our\nlocal markets and thereby increase the risk of default by our borrowers or reduce the foreclosure value of agricultural land and equipment that serve as\ncollateral of our loans. In particular, farm income has seen recent declines, and in line with the downturn in farm income, farmland prices are coming under\npressure.\nThe state of California periodically experiences severe droughts resulting in significantly reduced water allocations for farmers in the Central Valley. Due to\nthese water issues, the impact on businesses and consumers located in the Company’s market areas is not possible to quantify. In response, the California state\nlegislature passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act with the purpose of promoting better local and regional management of groundwater use and\nsustainable groundwater management in California by 2042. The local districts began to develop, prepare, and implement the Groundwater Sustainability Plans\nin 2020. The effect of such plans on Central Valley agriculture, if any, is still unknown.\nThe Company’s earnings are impacted by monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The FRB has, and is likely to continue\nto have, an important impact on the operating results of depository institutions through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, to\ncurb inflation or combat a recession. The FRB affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States\ngovernment securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks, and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are\nsubject. The FOMC has indicated that due to elevated inflation it expects to continue to raise interest rates in the near term, albeit at a reduced pace. While it\nhad been expected that the FRB would continue to raise short-term interest rates in 2023, it is unknown what effects the recent banking turmoil and current\ninternational instability will have on inflation, the FRB’s monetary policies, and the elevated potential for a recession in the US economy. It is possible that\ninterest rates will hold at current levels or decline.\nInflation may negatively affect the market value of investment securities and lead to increased interest expense on deposits and higher costs for borrowings as\nwell as increased labor costs due to higher wages. Additionally, increased inflation levels could lead to higher oil and gas prices, which may negatively impact\nthe net operating income of borrowers and affect their ability to repay their loans.\nElevated inflation and expectations for elevated future inflation can adversely impact economic growth, consumer and business confidence, and our financial\ncondition and results. In addition, elevated inflation may cause unexpected changes in monetary policies and actions which may adversely affect consumer\nconfidence, the economy, and our financial condition and results.\nSupply chain constraints and a tightening of labor markets could potentially exacerbate inflation and sustain it at elevated levels, even as growth slows. The\nrisk of sustained high inflation would likely be accompanied by monetary policy tightening with potential negative effects on various elevated asset classes.\nThe Company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area. Balance sheet management,\nenhancing revenue sources, and maintaining market share will continue to be of primary importance.\n22\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth selected historical consolidated financial information for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2023.\nThe selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except per share data and ratios) 2023 2022 2021\nSummary of Year-to-Date Earnings:\nInterest income $ 60,377 $ 49,257 $ 37,730\nInterest expense 11,056 3,195 2,079\nNet interest income 49,321 46,062 35,651\nProvision for credit losses 1,460 1,802 2,107\nNet interest income after provision for credit losses 47,861 44,260 33,544\nNoninterest income 5,569 1,838 3,385\nNoninterest expense 25,954 24,039 23,615\nIncome before provision for income taxes 27,476 22,059 13,314\nProvision for income taxes 7,680 6,373 3,216\nNet income $ 19,796 $ 15,686 $ 10,098\nPer Share Data:\nNet income - Basic $ 1.16 $ 0.92 $ 0.59\nNet income - Diluted $ 1.16 $ 0.92 $ 0.59\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - Basic 17,114,214 17,040,241 17,011,379\nWeighted average common shares shares outstanding - Diluted 17,125,186 17,061,833 17,030,874\nBook value per share $ 7.14 $ 6.59 $ 7.06\nFinancial Position at Year End:\nTotal assets $ 1,211,045 $ 1,299,193 $ 1,330,944\nTotal net loans 904,384 969,996 862,200\nTotal deposits 1,004,477 1,165,484 1,188,106\nTotal shareholders’ equity 122,542 112,463 120,207\nSelected Financial Ratios:\nReturn on average assets 1.57 % 1.16 % 0.82 %\nReturn on average equity 17.05 % 13.75 % 8.47 %\nAverage equity to average assets 9.20 % 8.46 % 9.69 %\nNet interest margin (1) 4.29 % 3.69 % 3.16 %\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of total nonperforming assets 95.15 % 52.16 % 56.06 %\nNet charge-offs to net loans 0.25 % 0.39 % 0.15 %\nNet loan-to-deposit ratio 90.04 % 83.23 % 72.57 %\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.24 % 0.10 % 0.17 %\nNonaccrual loans to total loans 1.24 % 1.48 % 1.32 %\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans 136.77 % 70.01 % 81.60 %\nAllowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans 1.70 % 1.04 % 1.07 %\nDividend payout ratio 40.67 % 47.82 % 74.16 %\n(1) Fully taxable-equivalent\n23\nTable of Contents\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $19.8 million, or $1.16 per basic and diluted share, compared to $15.7 million, or $0.92 per basic and\ndiluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase of $4.1 million between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 is primarily the result\nof increases in net interest income, offset by increases in interest paid on deposits and short-term borrowings. Interest income increased by $11.1 million, or\n22.6%, between December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The provision for income taxes increased by $1.3 million, or 20.5%.\nReturn on average assets was 1.57% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 1.16% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Return on average\nequity was 17.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 13.75% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe higher return on average assets experienced by the Company between 2023 and 2022 resulted from increases in income due to the higher interest rates\nreflected in the loan and investment portfolios, and a decrease in average assets. Increases in the return on average equity were the result of growth in net\nincome outpacing growth in shareholder’s equity. The growth in equity is affected by our dividend payout ratio as well as changes in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the most significant component of earnings, is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid\non interest-bearing liabilities. Earning assets consist primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, investments in securities issued by federal, state and local\nauthorities, and corporations, as well as interest-bearing deposits and overnight investments in federal funds loaned to other financial institutions. These\nearning assets are funded by a combination of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities, primarily customer deposits, and may include short-term and\nlong-term borrowings.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses was $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of $3.3 million, or\n7.1%, compared to net interest income before provision for credit losses of $46.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Market rate increases and\ndisciplined deposit pricing saw the net interest margin, as shown in Table 1 below, increase to 4.29% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net interest\nmargin was 3.72% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n24\nTable of Contents\nDistribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity:\nThe following table summarizes the distribution of average assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as well as interest income and yields earned on average\ninterest‑earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest‑bearing liabilities, presented on a tax-equivalent basis for the years indicated:\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) Average Balance Interest Average Yield/Rate Average Balance Interest Average Yield/Rate\nAssets:\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans and leases (1) (2) $ 942,135 $ 54,183 5.75 % $ 912,343 $ 43,039 4.72 %\nSecurities:\nTaxable securities 199,406 5,820 2.92 % 199,154 4,563 2.29 %\nTax-exempt securities (3) 2,552 50 1.96 % 2,569 50 1.95 %\nTotal investment securities 201,958 201,723\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB 6,187 324 5.24 % 122,575 1,605 1.31 %\nTotal interest-earning assets 1,150,280 $ 60,377 5.25 % 1,236,641 $ 49,257 3.98 %\nAllowance for credit losses (15,759) (9,708)\nNoninterest-earning assets:\nNonaccrual loans 13,300 11,937\nCash and due from banks 34,811 36,689\nPremises and equipment, net 9,390 9,295\nAccrued interest receivable 7,329 7,590\nOther real estate owned 4,582 4,579\nOther assets 60,927 54,159\nTotal average assets $ 1,264,860 $ 1,351,182\nLiabilities and Shareholders’ Equity:\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nNOW accounts $ 137,007 $ 307 0.22 % $ 136,568 $ 175 0.13 %\nMoney market accounts 311,654 4,244 1.36 % 398,379 2,125 0.53 %\nSavings accounts 119,312 132 0.11 % 123,396 137 0.11 %\nTime deposits 83,126 2,075 2.50 % 69,741 378 0.54 %\nOther borrowings 63,183 3,499 5.54 % — — 0.00 %\nJunior subordinated debentures 10,793 799 7.40 % 10,682 380 3.56 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 725,075 $ 11,056 1.52 % 738,766 $ 3,195 0.43 %\nNoninterest-bearing liabilities:\nNoninterest-bearing checking 410,673 488,053\nAccrued interest payable 274 146\nOther liabilities 12,441 9,864\nTotal average liabilities 1,148,463 1,236,829\nTotal average shareholders’ equity 116,397 114,353\nTotal average liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 1,264,860 $ 1,351,182\nInterest income as a percentage of average earning assets 5.25 % 3.98 %\nInterest expense as a percentage of average earning assets 0.96 % 0.26 %\nNet interest margin 4.29 % 3.72 %\n(1) Loan interest income includes loan costs of approximately $297 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and loan fees of approximately $505 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(2) Average loans do not include nonaccrual loans but do include interest income recovered from previously charged-off loans.\n(3) Calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis, which includes Federal tax benefits relating to income earned on municipal bonds totaling $14 for both 2022 and 2023.\nThe prime rate increased from 7.50% for the year ended 2022 to 8.50% for the year ended 2023. Future increases or decreases will affect rates for both interest\nincome and expense and the resultant net interest margin.\nBoth net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,\nreferred to as “volume change.” Both are also affected by changes in yields on interest-earning\n25\nTable of Contents\nassets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest\nexpense for each major category of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability, and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for\nthe years ended December 31, indicated.\nRate and Volume Analysis:\n2023 compared to 2022\n(In thousands) Total Rate Volume\nIncrease (decrease) in interest income:\nLoans $ 11,144 $ 9,651 1,493\nInvestment securities 1,257 1,252 5\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB (1,281) 5,913 (7,194)\nTotal interest income 11,120 16,816 (5,696)\nIncrease (decrease) in interest expense:\nInterest-bearing demand accounts 2,251 2,675 (424)\nSavings accounts (5) — (5)\nTime deposits 1,697 1,611 86\nOther borrowings 3,499 — 3,499\nSubordinated debentures 419 415 4\nTotal interest expense 7,861 4,701 3,160\nIncrease in net interest income $ 3,259 $ 12,115 (8,856)\nThe net interest margin increased in 2023 due to increases in loan portfolio yields, yields on overnight investments with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), and\ninvestment securities yields. The increases in yields are a result of repricing of variable-rate loans, floating-rate investment securities, and higher rates on\ninterest-bearing deposits at FRB. The yield on the loan portfolio was 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.7% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total interest income increased approximately $11.1 million, or 22.6%, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, reflective of increases of $11.1 million in loan interest income and $1.3 million in investment income, offset by decreases of $1.3 million\nin interest-bearing deposits held at FRB. Average interest-earning assets decreased approximately $86.4 million between 2023 and 2022 and the rate on\ninterest-earning assets increased 127 basis points between the two periods. The decrease in average earning assets between 2023 and 2022 was the result of a\ndecrease of $116.4 million in interest-bearing deposits held with the FRB, partially offset by increases of $29.8 million in loans.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, total interest expense increased approximately $7.9 million, or 246.0%, as compared to the year ended December 31,\n2022, due to increased expenses on deposits and short-term borrowings. Between the two periods, average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $13.7\nmillion, and the average rates paid on these liabilities increased by 109 basis points. While the Company may utilize brokered deposits as an additional source\nof funding, the Company held no brokered deposits at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the year-to-date averages of the components of interest-earning assets as a percentage of total interest-earning assets, and the\ncomponents of interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total interest-bearing liabilities:\nYear-to-Date Average\n2023 2022\nLoans 82.11 % 74.02 %\nInvestment securities available for sale 17.36 % 16.16 %\nInterest-bearing deposits in FRB 0.53 % 9.82 %\nTotal earning assets 100.00 % 100.00 %\nNOW accounts 18.90 % 18.49 %\nMoney market accounts 42.98 % 53.92 %\nSavings accounts 16.46 % 16.70 %\nTime deposits 11.46 % 9.44 %\nSubordinated debentures 1.49 % 1.45 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 100.00 % 100.00 %\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvisions for credit losses are determined on the basis of management’s periodic credit review of the loan portfolio, consideration of past loan loss experience,\ncurrent and future economic conditions, and other pertinent factors. After reviewing these factors, management, at times, makes adjustments in order to\nmaintain an allowance for credit losses adequate for the coverage of estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Based on the condition of the loan portfolio,\nmanagement believes the allowance is appropriate to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, a $1.5 million provision was made to the allowance for credit losses. A provision totaling $1.8 million was made for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased to 1.70% of total loans at December 31, 2023, as compared to 1.04% at December 31, 2022. The provision of $1.8\nmillion recorded in 2022, and the provision of $1.5 million recorded during 2023, are a result of charge-offs recognized primarily within the student loan\nportfolio and adjustment in qualitative factors related to economic uncertainties. For further discussion, refer to “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses.”\nThe increase in the allowance for credit losses was primarily due to the adoption of the current expected credit loss (CECL) accounting standard, which was\neffective as of January 1, 2023. The adoption resulted in an increase of $6.4 million to the balance of the allowance for credit losses. The increase in the\nprovision during the year, is primarily the result of charge-offs in the student loan portfolio, offset by decreases in loan balances.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated:\n(In thousands) 2023 % of Total 2022 % of Total\nCustomer service fees $ 2,918 52.40 % $ 3,027 164.69 %\nIncrease in cash surrender value of bank-owned life insurance 557 10.00 % 555 30.20 %\nGain (loss) on fair value of marketable equity securities 39 0.70 % (429) (23.34)%\nGain on proceeds from bank-owned life insurance 907 16.29 % — —\nGain (loss) on fair value of junior subordinated debentures 274 4.92 % (2,533) (137.81)%\nGain on sale of investment securities — — % 30 1.63 %\nLoss on sale of assets — — % (10) (0.55)%\nOther 874 15.69 % 1,198 65.18 %\nTotal $ 5,569 100.00 % $ 1,838 100.00 %\n27\nTable of Contents\nNoninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services provided to banking customers, fair value adjustments to the value of the\njunior subordinated debentures, and, to a lesser extent, loss on sales of Company assets and other miscellaneous income.\nNoninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $3.7 million, or 203.0%, when compared to 2022. Customer service fees, the primary\ncomponent of noninterest income, decreased $109,000, or 3.6%, between the two periods. The increase in noninterest income of $3.7 million between the two\nperiods is primarily the result of changes in the fair value of junior subordinated debentures. A gain of $274,000 was recorded during the year ended 2023 as\ncompared to a loss of $2.5 million during 2022. The change in the fair value of junior subordinated debentures was primarily caused by fluctuations in the\nSOFR yield curve. Also adding to the increase, were proceeds of $907,000 from bank-owned life insurance and a positive change in the market value of equity\nsecurities of $468,000.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n% of % of\nAverage Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Earning Assets Amount Earning Assets\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 13,157 1.14 % $ 11,833 0.96 %\nOccupancy expense 3,739 0.33 % 3,467 0.28 %\nData processing 784 0.07 % 686 0.06 %\nProfessional fees 4,366 0.38 % 4,058 0.33 %\nRegulatory assessments 727 0.06 % 794 0.06 %\nDirector fees 438 0.04 % 452 0.04 %\nCorrespondent bank service charges 80 0.01 % 93 0.01 %\nNet cost of operation of OREO 201 0.02 % 102 0.01 %\nOther 2,462 0.21 % 2,554 0.21 %\nTotal $ 25,954 2.26 % $ 24,039 1.94 %\nNoninterest expense increased $1.9 million, or 8.0%, between the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net increase in noninterest expense between\nthe comparative periods is primarily the result of increases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, and occupancy expense. The increase in salaries\nand employee benefits for the year are related to increased salary expense, group insurance costs, and bonus accruals. Increases in professional fees are related\nto increases in service contracts while increases in occupancy expense are related to increased depreciation expense. Included in net costs of operations of\nOREO for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, are OREO operating expenses totaling $126,000 and $102,000, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $141,000 and $185,000 respectively.\nThis expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is impacted to some degree by permanent taxable differences between income reported for book purposes and income reported\nfor tax purposes, as well as certain tax credits which are not reflected in the statements of operations and comprehensive income. As pretax income or loss\namounts become greater, the impact of these differences becomes less significant and is reflected as variances in the effective tax rate for the periods presented.\nIn general, the permanent differences and tax credits affecting tax expense have a positive impact and tend to reduce the effective tax rates shown in the\nstatements of income and comprehensive income. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 28.0% compared to 28.9% for the year\nended December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to non-taxable proceeds from bank-owned life insurance received during 2023.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table sets forth key financial data as of and for the years ended:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nDue from Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) $ 207 $ 6,945 $ (6,738) (97.0)%\nLoans, net of unearned income $ 904,384 $ 969,996 $ (65,612) (6.2)%\nInvestment securities $ 184,620 $ 210,860 $ (26,240) (12.4)%\nTotal assets $ 1,211,045 $ 1,299,193 $ (88,148) (6.8)%\nTotal deposits $ 1,004,477 $ 1,165,484 $ (161,007) (13.8)%\nTotal liabilities $ 1,088,503 $ 1,186,730 $ (98,227) (8.3)%\nAverage interest-earning assets $ 1,150,280 $ 1,236,641 $ (86,361) (7.0)%\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities $ 725,075 $ 738,766 $ (13,691) (1.9)%\nNet loans decreased due to loan paydowns and payoffs. Investment securities decreased due to principal repayments and treasury-security maturities. Both\novernight interest-bearing deposits in the Federal Reserve Bank and federal funds sold and total deposits decreased due to declines in interest- and non-interest\nbearing deposits.\nLoans\nThe Company’s primary business is that of acquiring deposits and making loans, with the loan portfolio representing the largest component of earning assets.\nGross loans totaled $921.3 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $60.5 million, or 6.2%, from $981.8 million at December 31, 2022. During 2023,\naverage loans increased 3.3% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. Average loans totaled $955.4 million and $924.3 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of loans, net of unearned income, outstanding by category and the category percentages as of the year-end dates\nindicated:\n2023 2022\n(In thousands) Dollar Amount % of Loans Dollar Amount % of Loans Change\nCommercial and industrial $ 53,347 5.8 % $ 57,902 5.9 % $ (4,555)\nReal estate mortgage 646,709 70.3 % 671,521 68.5 % $ (24,812)\nRE construction & development 127,944 13.9 % 153,374 15.6 % $ (25,430)\nAgricultural 49,795 5.4 % 52,722 5.4 % $ (2,927)\nInstallment and student loans 42,247 4.6 % 44,659 4.6 % $ (2,412)\nTotal loans $ 920,042 100.0 % $ 980,178 100.0 % $ (60,136)\nLoan volume continues to be highest in what has historically been the Bank’s primary lending emphasis: real estate mortgage and construction lending. Total\nloans decreased 6.1% during 2023. Real estate construction and development loans decreased 16.6%, commercial and industrial loans decreased 7.9%,\nagricultural loans decreased 5.6%, installment loans decreased 5.4%, and real estate mortgage loans decreased 3.7%.\nThe real estate mortgage loan portfolio, totaling $646.7 million at December 31, 2023, consists of commercial real estate, residential mortgages, and home\nequity loans. Commercial real estate loans have remained a significant percentage of total loans over the past year, amounting to 42.0% and 40.6%, of the total\nloan portfolio at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Commercial real estate balances decreased to $386.1 million at December 31, 2023\nfrom $398.1 million at December 31, 2022. Commercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short- to medium-term, fixed and floating rate instruments and\nare mainly secured by commercial income and multi-family residential properties. Residential mortgage loans are generally 30-year amortizing loans with an\naverage life of six to eight years. These loans totaled $260.5 million or 28.3% of the portfolio at December 31, 2023, and $273.4 million, or 27.9% of the\nportfolio at December 31, 2022. Real estate\n29\nTable of Contents\nmortgage loans in total decreased $24.8 million or 3.7% during 2023. The home equity loan portfolio totaled $36,000 at December 31, 2023, and $49,000 at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nReal estate construction and development loans, representing 13.9% and 15.6% of total loans at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,\nconsist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as land acquisition and development, or land held for future development. Loans\nin this category are secured by real estate including improved and unimproved land, as well as single-family residential, multi-family residential, and\ncommercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity requirements. Repayment of construction loans generally\ncomes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project or from the sale of the constructed homes to individuals.\nPurchased loan participations totaled $9.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2022. Loan participations sold decreased\nfrom $9.7 million, or 1.0%, of the portfolio at December 31, 2022, to $4.2 million, or 0.5%, at December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 52.7% of commercial and industrial loans have floating rates and, although some may be secured by real estate, many\nare secured by accounts receivable, inventory, and other business assets. Construction loans are generally short-term, floating-rate obligations, which consist of\nboth residential and commercial projects. Agricultural loans, are primarily short-term, floating-rate loans for crop financing.\nIncluded within the installment loan portfolio are $38.5 million of student loans as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $42.1 million at December 31, 2022,\na decrease of $3.6 million. The student loan portfolio consists of unsecured loans to medical and pharmacy school students in the U.S. and Caribbean. Upon\ngraduation, the loan is placed in a grace period for six months. This may be extended as a deferment to 48 months for graduates enrolling in internship, medical\nresidency, or fellowship. The student may receive additional deferment for hardship or administrative reasons in the form of forbearance for a maximum of 36\nmonths throughout the life of the loan. The outstanding balance of student loans that are in school or grace and have not entered repayment status totaled $1.7\nmillion at December 31, 2023. Accrued interest on student loans that are in school or grace and totaled $1.0 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31,\n2023, there were 779 loans within repayment, deferment, and forbearance which represented $20.8 million, $10.2 million, and $5.8 million in outstanding\nbalances, respectively. Student loans have not been purchased or originated since 2019.\nRepayment of the unsecured student loans is premised on the medical and pharmacy students graduating and becoming high-income earners. Under program\nguidelines, repayment terms can vary per borrower; however, repayment occurs on average within 10 to 20 years. Additionally, there are non-student, co-\nborrowers for roughly one-third of the portfolio, providing additional repayment capacity. The average student loan balance per borrower as of December 31,\n2023, was approximately $107,000. Loan interest rates are variable and currently range from 6.00% to 13.25%.\nAt December 31, 2023, $20.8 million of student loans were in repayment compared to $23.4 million as of December 31, 2022. Accrued interest on student\nloans totaled $3.5 million and $4.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the reserve against the student loan\nportfolio totaled $6.3 million. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2023, $252,000 in accrued interest receivable was reversed, due to charge-offs\nof $2.6 million. At December 31, 2022, the reserve totaled $2.6 million and $141,000 in accrued interest was reversed due to charge-offs of $1.3 million.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the Bank’s student loan portfolio with activity from December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023:\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 48,456\nCapitalized Interest 2,622\nPayments Received (1,024)\nLoan Consolidations/Payoffs (6,586)\nLoans Charged-off (1,337)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 42,131\nCapitalized Interest 3,712\nPayments Received (1,660)\nLoan Consolidations/Payoffs (3,102)\nLoans Charged-off (2,588)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 38,493\nStudent Loan Finance Corporation (ZuntaFi) is the third-party servicer for the student loan portfolio.

Collateralized and\nuncollateralized lines of credit have been established with several correspondent banks. The FRB discount window, as well as a securities dealer, may also be\naccessed as needed.\nFunds may be borrowed in the future as part of the Company’s asset/liability strategy, and may be used to acquire assets as deemed appropriate by management\nfor investment purposes or for capital utilization purposes. Federal funds purchased\n34\nTable of Contents\nrepresent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured. Repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage\nbacked securities and securities of U.S. Government agencies, and generally have maturities of one to six months, but may have longer maturities if deemed\nappropriate. FHLB advances are collateralized by investments in FHLB stock, securities, and certain qualifying mortgage loans. Additionally, borrowings\ncollateralized by pledged loans may be secured from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB). Credit lines are subject to periodic review by the credit\nlines grantors relative to the Company’s financial statements. Lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time.\nLines of credit with the FRB of $463.5 million and $435.6 million, as well as FHLB lines of credit totaling $128.9 million and $2.2 million were available at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains a $50 million uncollateralized line of credit with Pacific Coast Bankers Bank, a\n$20 million uncollateralized line of credit with Zion’s Bank, and a $10 million uncollateralized line of credit with US Bank. At December 31, 2023, short-term\nborrowings totaled $62.0 million and were comprised of a $60.0 million secured, short-term loan from FHLB and an unsecured, overnight borrowing of $2.0\nmillion from PCBB. These lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the Federal Funds rate or are indexed to short-term U.S. Treasury rates or SOFR.\nAsset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLending money is the principal business activity, and ensuring appropriate evaluation, diversification, and control of credit risks is a primary management\nresponsibility. Losses are implicit in lending activities and the amount of such losses will vary, depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as\naffected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), effective January 1, 2023, and utilizes a current expected credit loss\n(CECL) methodology which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the\ndata to determine pool loss experience. The allowance for credit losses on most loans is measured on a collective (pool) basis for loans with similar\ncharacteristics. The Company estimates the appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for collateral-dependent loans by evaluating them separately. A loan\nis evaluated individually when it does not share similar risk characteristics with the pool being evaluated, it is evaluated individually. The Company also uses\nthe CECL model to calculate the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as undrawn amounts on lines of credit. While the\nallowance for credit losses on loans is reported as a contra-asset for loans, the allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposure is reported as a\nliability.\nThe eight (8) segments of the loan portfolio are as follows (subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to loan classifications\nreported elsewhere in this report):\nLoan Segments for Allowance for Credit Loss Analysis December 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCommercial and business loans $ 53,273 $ 57,770\nGovernment program loans 74 132\nTotal commercial and industrial 53,347 57,902\nReal estate – mortgage:\nCommercial real estate 386,134 398,115\nResidential mortgages 260,539 273,357\nHome improvement and home equity loans 36 49\nTotal real estate mortgage 646,709 671,521\nReal estate construction and development 127,944 153,374\nAgricultural 49,795 52,722\nInstallment and student loans 42,247 44,659\nTotal loans $ 920,042 $ 980,178\n35\nTable of Contents\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans and Specific Reserves:\nThe following table summarizes the components of individually-evaluated loans and their related specific reserves:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands) Balance Allowance Balance Allowance\nCommercial and industrial $ — $ — $ — $ —\nReal estate – mortgage — — 141 4\nReal estate construction and development 11,390 — 14,436 —\nAgricultural 451 14 1,051 48\nInstallment and student loans — — — —\nTotal individually-evaluated loans $ 11,841 $ 14 $ 15,628 $ 52\nLoans are evaluated individually when risk characteristics are not similar to the pool being evaluated.

There were no reserves for real estate construction and development loans at December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, due to the value of the collateral securing those loans.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans\nA loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through\nthe operation or sale of the collateral.\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in collateral-dependent loans by type of loan:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Number of\nCollateral- Collateral-\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Dependent Loans Amount Dependent Loans\nReal estate construction and development loans $ 11,390 3 $ 14,436 4\nAgricultural loans 390 1 108 2\nTotal $ 11,780 4 $ 14,544 6\nCredit Quality Indicators for Outstanding Student Loans:\nThe following table summarizes the credit quality indicators for outstanding student loans as of:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Principal Accrued Number of Principal Accrued\n(In thousands, except number of loans) Loans Amount Interest Loans Amount Interest\nSchool 44 $ 1,242 $ 734 70 $ 2,056 $ 908\nGrace 18 473 296 27 667 348\nRepayment 444 20,833 289 516 23,414 857\nDeferment 237 10,163 2,022 268 10,974 1,732\nForbearance 98 5,782 133 91 5,019 237\nTotal 841 $ 38,493 $ 3,474 972 $ 42,130 $ 4,082\nIncluded in installment loans are $38.5 million and $42.1 million in student loans at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, made to medical\nand pharmacy school students.

This was primarily due to adjustments related to the adoption of\nCECL, offset by decreases in past due and nonaccrual loans and decreases in loan balances as a whole. Increases in installment loans were related to both the\nCECL adjustment and charge-offs within the student loan portfolio. CECL is a forward-looking measure which applies prospective loss rates based on both\nhistorical loss patterns and a reasonable and supportable forecast on a per loan basis.\nDuring 2022, reserve allocations as a percentage of loans decreased for commercial and industrial, real estate construction and development, and installment\nand student loans These decreases are a result of a combination of factors including decreases in charge-offs, classified and past due loans, and credit quality\nimprovements. The decrease in reserves was attributed to a decrease in the loss factor for the agricultural segment. Reserves for installment and student loans\nincreased although the allowance as a percentage of loans decreased for that segment.\nThe following table sets forth nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nNonaccrual loans $ 11,448 $ 14,544\nAccruing restructured loans — 141\nLoans, past due 90 days or more, still accruing 426 252\nTotal non-performing loans 11,874 14,937\nOther real estate owned 4,582 4,582\nTotal non-performing assets $ 16,456 $ 19,519\nNon-performing loans to total gross loans 1.29 % 1.52 %\nNon-performing assets to total gross loans 1.79 % 1.99 %\nAllowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans 136.77 % 70.01 %\nThe accrual of interest income on loans is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectability of interest or principal due to the\ninability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement. With the exception of student loans, loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status\nwhen the payment of principal or interest is 90 days past due, or earlier if warranted. Interest collected thereafter is credited to principal to the extent necessary\nto eliminate doubt as to the collectability of the net carrying amount of the loan. Exceptions may be granted to this policy if the loans are well secured and in\nthe process of collection.\nNon-performing loans at December 31, 2023 decreased $3.1 million between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, due to decreases of $3.1 million in\nnonaccrual loans, offset by increases in accruing accruing loans past due 90 days.\n38\nTable of Contents\nThe loan portfolio decreased from $980.2 million at December 31, 2022 to $920.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets decreased to $16,456\nat December 31, 2023, from $19,519 at December 31, 2022. Nonaccrual loans, accruing loans past due 90 days, and OREO are included in nonperforming\nloans.\nThe following table summarizes various components of the loan portfolio for the years ended:\nDecember 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nProvision for credit losses during period $ 1,460 $ 1,802\nAllowance as % of nonaccrual loans 136.77 % 70.01 %\nNonperforming loans as % total loans 1.29 % 1.52 %\nAllowance as % of total loans 1.70 % 1.04 %\nIn determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to these loans, management monitors trends within specific geographical areas, loan-to-value\nratios, appraisals, and other credit issues related to specific loans.\nManagement continues to monitor and reduce the level of problem assets by working with borrowers to identify options, such as loan modifications, which\nmay help borrowers facing difficulties. Net loan charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $2.3 million, compared to $1.0 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. Charge-offs of $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and $1.3 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022 were related to the student loan portfolio. The percentage of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.25%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and\n0.10% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the years ended:\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 Change\nReal estate - construction 11,403 14,436 (3,033)\nAgricultural 45 108 (63)\nTotal $ 11,448 $ 14,544 $ (3,096)\nLoans past due more than 30 days receive management attention and are monitored for increased risk. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, loans past due more\nthan 30 days totaled $13.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively.\nExcept for the loans included in the above tables, there were no loans at December 31, 2023, where the known credit problems of a borrower made doubtful the\nability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms resulting in such loan being included as nonaccrual or past due at some future date.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company’s asset/liability management, liquidity strategy, and capital planning are guided by policies, formulated and monitored by the Asset/Liability\nCommittee (ALCO) and Management, to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive\nliabilities.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on- and off-balance sheet financial obligations, including\nloan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals, without straining the Company’s equity structure. To maintain an adequate liquidity position, the\nCompany relies on, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, cash inflows from deposits and short-term borrowings, repayments of principal on loans and\ninvestments, and net interest income received. The Company’s principal cash outflows are for loan origination, purchases of investment securities, depositor\nwithdrawals and payment of operating expenses.\nThe Company’s liquid asset base, which generally consists of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, and investment securities, is maintained at levels\ndeemed sufficient to provide the cash necessary to fund loan growth, unfunded loan commitments, and deposit runoff. Included in this framework is the\nobjective of maximizing the yield on earning assets. This is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans and investment\nsecurities, which are higher yielding assets compared to cash.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth asset balances for the period ended:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance % Total Assets Balance % Total Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 40,784 3.4 % $ 38,595 3.0 %\nLoans, net of unearned income 920,042 76.0 % 980,178 75.4 %\nUnpledged investment securities 98,394 8.1 % 138,568 10.7 %\nAt December 31, 2023, the loan-to-deposit ratio was 91.6% as compared to 84.1% at December 31, 2022.\nLiabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non-core deposits as well as short-term borrowings capability. Core deposits comprised\napproximately 97.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2023 and 98.7% at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, short-term borrowing totaled $62.0\nmillion, including a term-loan of $60.0 million at FHLB and an overnight borrowing of $2.0 million at PCBB. At December 31, 2023, unused lines of credit\nwith the Federal Home Loan Bank, Pacific Coast Banker’s Bank, Zion’s Bank, Union Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank totaling $672.4 million were\ncollateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the Company’s loan portfolio. The carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing\nlines totaled $604.0 million at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no borrowings. Credit lines totaling $557.8 million were partially\ncollateralized by pledged loans of $590.4 million at December 31, 2022. For a further detail of the Company’s borrowing arrangements, see “Note 8 - Short-\nTerm Borrowings/Other Borrowings,” in the consolidated financial statements.\nCash and cash equivalents increased $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and decreased $180.6 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year: $ 38,595 $ 219,219\nCash flows from operating activities: 21,376 23,700\nCash flows from investing activities: 87,583 (174,233)\nCash flows from financing activities: (106,770) (30,091)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year: $ 40,784 $ 38,595\nNet cash inflows from operations increased to $21.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $23.7 million for the period ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company experienced net cash inflows from investing activities totaling $87.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 and\nnet cash outflows of $174.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The net cash outflow from financing activities totaling $106.8\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2023 was due primarily to decreases in demand deposits, NOW and money market accounts, and savings accounts.\nThe net cash inflows from investing activities were primarily the result of principal paydowns on securities, treasury security maturities, and proceeds from\nbank-owned life insurance. Net cash outflows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, were due to the purchase of residential\nmortgage loans pools and purchases of investment securities. Net cash outflows from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, were due\nto decreases in demand deposits, time deposits, and savings accounts.\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or the Company may become unduly\nreliant on alternative funding sources. The Company maintains a liquidity risk management policy and contingency funding plan to address and manage this\nrisk. The policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity, sets wholesale funding limits, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and\nestablishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. The liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly\nbasis to the Board of Directors. In addition to ongoing monitoring, the Company performs liquidity stress testing in accordance with industry best practices to\nensure cash flow requirements are met under stressed scenarios.\nThe liquidity of the parent company, United Security Bancshares, is separate from the Bank and is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its\nsubsidiary, United Security Bank, subject to limitations imposed by the Financial Code of the\n40\nTable of Contents\nState of California and federal and state banking regulations. During each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Bank paid\n$8.5 million in cash dividends to the parent company.\nCapital and Dividends\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n“Board of Governors”). Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators\nthat, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the\nregulatory framework, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and certain\noff-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by\nthe regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nThe Company has adopted a capital plan that includes guidelines and trigger points to ensure sufficient capital is maintained at the Bank and the Company, and\nthat capital ratios are maintained at a level deemed appropriate under regulatory guidelines given the level of classified assets, concentrations of credit,\nallowance for credit losses, current and projected growth, and projected retained earnings. The capital plan also contains contingency strategies to obtain\nadditional capital as required to fulfill future capital requirements for both the Bank, as a separate legal entity, and the Company on a consolidated basis. The\ncapital plan includes a target for the Bank to maintain a ratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total tangible assets equal to or greater than 9%. The Bank’s\nratio of tangible shareholders’ equity to total tangible assets was 12.2% and 10.5% at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company’s equity capital totaled $122.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $112.5 million at December 31, 2022. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company paid $8.1 million in cash dividends to shareholders.\nFor a more detailed discussion of regulatory capital requirements and dividends, see “Note 21 - Regulatory Matters” to the consolidated financial\nstatements, as well as under the captions “Supervision and Regulation - The Company - Capital Adequacy” and “Supervision and Regulation - The Bank\n- Capital Standards” set forth in Part I, Item I., of this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Management believes that, under the\ncurrent regulations, both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future.\nReserve Balances\nThe FRB no longer requires depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non-\npersonal time deposits. At December 31, 2023, the Bank was not subject to a reserve requirement.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP),\nmanagement is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and\nrevenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and\ntheir related application are discussed below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses (ACL) represents the estimated probable credit losses in our loan and investment portfolios and is estimated as of December 31,\n2023, using CECL. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022, was estimated using the incurred loss model. The Company’s method for\nassessing the appropriateness of the ACL includes specific allowances for individually analyzed loans, formula allowance factors for pools of credits, and\nqualitative considerations which include, among other things, current and forecast economic and environmental factors. Allowance factors for loan pools were\nbased on historical loss experience by product type.\nManagement estimates the ACL balance using relevant information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool)\n41\nTable of Contents\nbasis when similar risk characteristics exist. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses, which captures loan\nbalances as of a point in time to form a cohort, and then tracks the respective losses generated by that cohort of loans over the remaining life. The Company has\nidentified and accumulated loan cohort historical loss data beginning with the first quarter of 2006 and through the current period. Adjustments to historical\nloss information are made using qualitative adjustments for differences in relevant current and forecasted loan-specific risk characteristics, such as the\nhistorical timing of losses relative to the loan origination.\nA significant amount of the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis by loan and investment security type when similar risk\ncharacteristics exist. Pools are determined based primarily on regulatory reporting codes as the loans and investment securities within each pool share similar\nrisk characteristics and there is sufficient historical peer loss data from the FFIEC to provide statistically meaningful support in the models developed for pools\nwhere the Company has limited historical loss experience. Reserves for credit losses identified on a pooled basis are then adjusted for qualitative factors to\nreflect current conditions. The most significant components of qualitative factors used to estimate the ACL are adjustments relating to prevailing economic\nconditions, concentrations within the loan portfolio, internal factors, and external factors. These estimates are subject to significant judgment and could\npotentially significantly increase or decrease the ACL.\nCertain loans are not included in pools of loans that are collectively evaluated. The segregation of these loans is based on the results from an analysis of\nindividually identified credits that meet management’s criteria for individual evaluation. These loans are first reviewed individually to determine if such loans\nhave a unique risk profile that would warrant individual evaluation. Loans where management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower will be unable\nto pay all amounts due under the original contractual terms are removed from the pools of loans collectively evaluated. They are then specifically reviewed and\nevaluated individually by management for loss potential by evaluating sources of repayment, including collateral as applicable, and a specified allowance for\ncredit losses is established where necessary.\nBecause current economic conditions and forecasts can change and future events make it inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated\ncredit losses on loans, management’s determination of the appropriateness of the ACL could change significantly. It is difficult to estimate how potential\nchanges in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the\nallowance and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types. Additionally,\nchanges in factors and inputs may move independently of one another, such that improvement in one or certain factors may offset deterioration in others. Thus,\nas a result of the significant size of the loan portfolio, the numerous assumptions in the model, and the high degree of potential change in such assumptions,\nthere is a high degree of sensitivity to the reported amounts. Management believes that the ACL was adequate as of December 31, 2023.\nFair Value of Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities\nThe Company elected the fair value option related to its junior subordinated debt. The accounting standards related to fair value measurements define how\napplicable assets and liabilities are to be valued and require expanded disclosures in regard to financial instruments carried at fair value. The fair value\nmeasurement accounting standard establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring\nfinancial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of\npricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available actively quoted prices, or whose fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices of\nrelated financial instruments, generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value.\nConversely, financial instruments that are traded infrequently or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a\nhigher degree of subjectivity. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial\ninstrument is new to the market, and the characteristics specific to the transaction. Determining fair values under the accounting standards may include\njudgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace. For example, fluctuations in financial market\ninterest rates can have a significant impact on the fair value determination, as well as the Company’s selection of bond credit ratings used in pricing modeling.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, fair value adjustments related to the junior subordinated debt resulted in a loss of $270,000 and a gain of\n$413,000, respectively. (See Notes 10 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about financial instruments carried\nat fair value.)\nOther Accounting Policies and Estimates that are Not Considered Critical\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those that may materially affect the financial statements and are related to investments,\nfair value measurements, retirement plans, and intangible assets. The Company bases its\n42\nTable of Contents\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s policies related to these estimates can be found in Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\nItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 659) 44\nConsolidated Balance Sheets 46\nConsolidated Statements of Income 47\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) 48\nConsolidated Statements Changes in Shareholders’ Equity 49\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows 50\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 51\n43\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nUnited Security Bancshares\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Security Bancshares and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended,\nand the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in\nall material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and\nits cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1,\n2023, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326: Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“Topic 326”). The Company adopted the\nnew credit loss standard using the modified retrospective approach such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance\nwith previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to\nhave, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. As part of our\naudits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Accordingly, we express no such\nopinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in\nthe consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13 effective\nJanuary 1, 2023 utilizing the current expected credit loss cohort methodology analysis, which relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar\nrisks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. The Company’s measurement of expected credit\nlosses on loans is based on relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable\n44\nTable of Contents\nand supportable forecasts. In estimating the allowance for credit losses on loans, the Company estimates loss rates for each loan pool based upon historical\nexperience from 2006 to 2023 and adjusts its quantitative model for certain qualitative factors to reflect the extent to which management expects current\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to differ from the conditions that existed for the period over which historical information was evaluated.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans was $15,658,000 as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans is a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on such loans\nand is a material and complex estimate requiring significant management judgment in the estimation of expected lifetime losses within the loan portfolio as of\nthe balance sheet date.\nWe identified the auditing of the allowance for credit losses on loans, including the historical loss rates and management’s qualitative adjustments as a critical\naudit matter. Estimation of the lifetime expected credit losses for loans, particularly as it relates to the historical loss rate methodology and qualitative factors,\nrequires significant management judgment. Auditing management’s judgments and assumptions involved significant audit effort as well as especially\nchallenging and subjective auditor judgment when performing audit procedures and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address the critical audit matter included testing the Company’s process used to develop the estimate for the\nallowance for credit losses on loans by:\na. Evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used.\nb. Evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions and qualitative adjustments used by management by comparing the historical loss rates\nand qualitative adjustments to the relevant internal and external data, including historical trends.\nc. Testing the mathematical accuracy of the computation, including testing completeness and accuracy of the internal data used and evaluating the\nrelevance and reliability of the external data used in the calculation, the historical loss rates and qualitative adjustments determined by management\nand used in the calculation.\n/s/ Moss Adams LLP\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 26, 2024\nWe have

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies\nBasis of Presentation – The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates, with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and with prevailing practices within the banking industry. The\nconsolidated financial statements include the accounts of United Security Bancshares, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, United Security Bank and subsidiary\n(the “Bank”) and USB Capital Trust II (the “Trust”). The Trust is deconsolidated pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810. As a result, the\nTrust Preferred Securities are not presented on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as equity, but instead they are presented as Junior Subordinated\nDebentures and are presented as a separate liability category (see Note 10 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements). Intercompany accounts and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the following notes, references to the Bank are references to United Security Bank. References to the\nCompany are references to United Security Bancshares (including the Bank). United Security Bancshares operates as one business segment providing banking\nservices to commercial establishments and individuals primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, and the greater Oakhurst/East Madera County area, as well as the\nCampbell area of Santa Clara County. The Company’s participation loans with other financial institutions are primarily in the state of California.\nNature of Operations – United Security Bancshares is a bank holding company, incorporated in the state of California for the purpose of acquiring all the\ncapital stock of the Bank through a holding company reorganization (the “Reorganization”) of the Bank. United Security Bancshares has provided the\nCompany greater operating and financial flexibility and has permitted expansion into a broader range of financial services and other business activities.\nThe Bank was founded in 1987 and currently operates twelve branches, one commercial lending office, one consumer lending office, and one construction\nlending office in an area from eastern Madera County to western Fresno County, as well as Taft and Bakersfield in Kern County, and Campbell in Santa Clara\nCounty. The Bank’s primary source of revenue is interest income from loans to customers, who are predominantly small- and middle-market businesses and\nindividuals. The Bank engages in a full complement of lending activities, including real estate mortgage, commercial and industrial, real estate construction,\nagricultural, and consumer loans, with particular emphasis on short- and medium-term obligations.\nThe Bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments. These include personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts, interest-bearing negotiable\norder of withdrawal (NOW) accounts, money market accounts and time certificates of deposit. Most of the Bank’s deposits are attracted from small- and\nmedium-sized business-related sources and from individuals.\nThe Bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders. These\nservices include cashiers checks, foreign drafts, and person-to-person and bank-to-bank transfers for consumer customers. In addition, the Bank offers internet\nbanking services to its commercial and retail customers. The Bank does not operate a trust department; however, it makes arrangements with its correspondent\nbank to offer trust services to its customers upon request.\nThe Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. (YMP), was incorporated in California on April 17, 2019, for the purpose of holding\nspecific parcels of real estate acquired by the Bank through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures in Monterey County. These properties exceeded the 10-year holding\nperiod for other real estate owned, or “OREO.” YMP was funded with a $250,000 cash investment and the transfer of those parcels by the Bank to YMP. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, these properties are included within the consolidated balance sheets as part of OREO.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting\nperiod. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and fair value of junior\nsubordinated debt (TRUPs).\nSubsequent events - The Company has evaluated events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through the day the consolidated financial\nstatements were issued.\n51\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies - The Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as\n“FASB.” FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that the Company follows to ensure the consistent reporting of its consolidated financial\ncondition, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows. References to GAAP issued by FASB in these footnotes are to FASB Accounting\nStandards Codification, sometimes referred to as the Codification, or ASC. The following is a summary of significant policies:\na. Cash and cash equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from correspondent banks. At times throughout the year,\nbalances can exceed FDIC insurance limits. Generally, federal funds sold and repurchase agreements are sold for one-day periods. The Bank did not have\nany repurchase agreements during 2023 or 2022. All cash and cash equivalents have maturities when purchased of three months or less.\nb. Securities - Debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income and\nreported, net of tax, as a separate component of comprehensive income (loss) and shareholders’ equity. Debt securities classified as held-to-maturity are\ncarried at amortized cost. Gains and losses on disposition are reported using the specific identification method for the adjusted basis of the securities sold.\nPremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.\nThe Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio on an individual security basis. Securities that are to be held for indefinite periods of time are\nclassified as available-for-sale. Those include, but are not limited to, securities that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability management\nstrategy, as well as those which may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayments, or other factors. Securities which the\nCompany has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. There were no securities classified as held-to-maturity as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated when the amortized cost of a security exceeds its fair value. If it is determined\nthat it will be necessary to sell a security before the fair value increases to the amortized cost, the amortized cost will be written down to fair value through\nincome. At that point, any previously recorded allowance for credit loss (ACL) would be written off and any additional impairment would be recognized\nthrough earnings. If it is believed that the Company will not be required to sell a security before the fair value recovers, a determination will be made as to\nwhether or not the decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss or noncredit factors such as changes in current market rates. If it is determined that the\ndecline is due to a credit loss, the amount recognized as the credit loss will be determined using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows expected to\nbe collected would be discounted at the effective interest rate established at acquisition. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less\nthan the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses would be recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the\nfair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other\ncomprehensive income.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses on investments are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the allowance when\nmanagement believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell\nis met.\nMarketable equity securities are reported at fair value with gains and losses included in noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nc. Loans - Interest income on loans is credited to income as earned and is calculated by using the simple interest method on the daily balance of the principal\namounts outstanding. With the exception of student loans, loans are typically placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest is past due for 90 days\nand/or when management believes the collection of amounts due is doubtful. Student loans are typically placed on non-accrual status when principal or\ninterest is past due for 120 days. For loans placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed based upon\nmanagement’s assessment of collectability, and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectability\nof the net carrying amount of the loan.\nNonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans are deferred and netted against outstanding loan balances.\nThe net deferred fees and costs are generally amortized into interest income over the loan’s term using the simple interest method. Other credit-related\nfees, such as standby letters of credit fees and loan placement fees, are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed.\nd. Allowance for credit losses on loans and reserve for unfunded loan commitments - The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, effective January 1, 2023, and\nutilizes the CECL cohort methodology analysis which relies on segmenting the loan\n52\nTable of Contents\nportfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the performance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Management\nestimates the allowance for credit loss balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The cumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the\nCompany’s historical loss experience from 2006 to 2023. The Company expects that the markets in which it operates will experience a slight decline in\neconomic conditions and an increase in unemployment rate and level and trend of delinquencies over the next year. Management adjusted the historical\nloss experience through qualitative factors for these expectations.\nThe Company analyzes risk characteristics inherent in each loan portfolio segment as part of the quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan\nlosses. The following summarizes some of the key risk characteristics for the ten segments of the loan portfolio (Consumer loans include three segments):\nCommercial and business loans – Commercial loans are subject to the effects of economic cycles and tend to exhibit increased risk as economic conditions\ndeteriorate, or if an economic downturn is prolonged. The Company considers this segment to be one of higher risk given the size of individual loans and\nthe balance in the overall portfolio.\nGovernment program loans – This is a relatively small part of the Company’s loan portfolio, but has historically had a high percentage of loans that have\nmigrated from pass to substandard given their vulnerability to economic cycles.\nCommercial real estate loans – This segment is considered to have more risk in part because of the vulnerability of commercial businesses to economic\ncycles as well as the exposure to fluctuations in real estate prices because most of these loans are secured by real estate. Losses in this segment have\nhowever been historically low because most of the loans are real-estate secured, and the bank maintains appropriate loan-to-value ratios.\nResidential mortgages – This segment is considered to have low risk factors based on the Company’s experience and peer statistics. These loans are\nsecured by first deeds of trust.\nHome improvement and home equity loans – Because of their junior lien position, these loans have an inherently higher risk level.\nReal estate construction and development loans –This segment of loans is considered to have a higher risk profile due to construction and market value\nissues in conjunction with normal credit risks.\nAgricultural loans – This segment is considered to have risks associated with weather, insects, and marketing issues. In addition, concentrations in certain\ncrops or certain agricultural areas can increase risk. Additionally, California may experience severe droughts, which can significantly harm the business of\ncustomers and the credit quality of the loans to those customers. Water resources and related issues affecting customers are closely monitored. Signs of\ndeterioration within the loan portfolio are also monitored in an effort to manage credit quality and work with borrowers where possible to mitigate any\nlosses.\nInstallment and student loans – This segment, which includes consumer loans, student loans, overdrafts, and overdraft protection lines, is considered\nhigher risk because most of the loans are unsecured. Additionally, in the case of student loans, there are increased risks associated with liquidity due to the\ntime lag between funding of a student loan and eventual repayment.\ne. Nonaccrual loans - Commercial, construction and commercial real estate loans are placed on non-accrual status under the following circumstances:\n• When there is doubt regarding the full repayment of interest and principal.\n• When principal and/or interest on the loan has been in default for a period of 90-days or more, unless the asset is both well secured and in the\nprocess of collection that will result in repayment in the near future.\n• When the loan is identified as having loss elements and/or is risk rated “8” Doubtful.\nWhen loans are placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest for financial statement purposes is discontinued. Previously accrued but unpaid interest\nis reversed and charged against interest income. Student loans past due more than 90-days are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are charged-off once\n120-days past due. See “Note 4- Student Loans” for specific information on the student loan portfolio.\n53\nTable of Contents\nWhen a loan is placed on non-accrual status and subsequent payments of interest (and principal) are received, the interest received may be accounted for in\ntwo separate ways.\nCost recovery method: If the loan is in doubt as to full collection, the interest received in subsequent payments is reversed out of interest income and\ntreated as a reduction of principal for financial reporting purposes.\nCash basis: This method is only used if the recorded investment or total contractual amount is expected to be fully collectible, under which circumstances\nthe subsequent payments of interest is credited to interest income as received.\nLoans on non-accrual status may be returned to accruing status when all delinquent principal and/or interest has been brought current, there is no identified\nelement of loss (on the contractual amount of the loan), and current and continued satisfactory performance is expected. Repayment ability is generally\ndemonstrated through the timely receipt of at least six monthly payments on a loan with monthly amortization.\nf. Individually-evaluated loans - When a financial asset does not share similar risk characteristics with the pool being evaluated, it is evaluated individually.\ng. Collateral-dependent loans - A loan is deemed collateral-dependent when either, it enters foreclosure, or it is determined that the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. Repayment of these loans is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.\nh. Bank-owned life insurance and company-owned life insurance policies - The Company owns bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI) and company-\nowned life insurance policies (COLI) on certain officers, including those covered under the salary continuation plan, with a portion of the post-retirement\nbenefit available to the officers’ beneficiaries. The initial net cash surrender value of BOLI and COLI policies is equivalent to the premium paid, and adds\nincome through non-taxable increases in cash surrender value, net of the cost of insurance, plus any death benefits ultimately received by the Company.\ni. Off-balance sheet financial instruments - In order to meet the needs of its customers, the Company offers financial instruments including commitments to\nextend credit and standby letters of credit (SBLC). SBLCs are used to guarantee financing arrangements or performance with third parties.\nj. Premises and equipment - Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is computed principally on the\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows:\nBuildings 31 years Furniture and equipment 3 -7 years\nk. Other-real-estate-owned - Real estate properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the\nproperty, less estimated costs to sell. The excess, if any, of the loan amount over the fair value is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent\ndeclines in the fair value of other-real-estate-owned, along with related revenue and expenses from operations, are charged to noninterest expense.\nl. Investment in Limited Partnership - The Bank owns an interest in a local area limited partnership which provides private capital for small- to mid-sized\nbusinesses. The investment is accounted for under the cost method.\nm. Goodwill - Goodwill amounts resulting from acquisitions are considered to have an indefinite life and are not amortized. At December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Company reported goodwill totaling $4.5 million. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges on goodwill during 2023 or 2022.\nn. Income taxes - Deferred income taxes result from the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets\nand liabilities using the liability method, and are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are\nexpected to be realized or settled. Estimates are based on the enacted tax rate of the applicable period.\no. Net income per common share - Basic income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\nDiluted income per share includes the effect of stock options and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. If applicable, net\nincome per common share is retroactively adjusted for all stock dividends declared.\n54\nTable of Contents\np. Cash flow reporting - For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, noninterest-bearing amounts due from banks,\nfederal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell. Federal funds and securities purchased under agreements to resell are generally sold\nfor a one-day periods. Net cash flows are reported for interest-bearing deposits with other banks, loans to customers, deposits held for customers, and\nshort-term borrowings.\nq. Transfers of financial assets - Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over\ntransferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of\nconditions that constrain the taking advantage of that right, beyond a trivial benefit) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company\ndoes not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase before maturity.\nr. Stock based compensation - The Company maintains a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in “Note 12 - Stock Based\nCompensation.” All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock units and awards, are recognized\nin the consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value is amortized over the requisite service period\n(generally the vesting period). Included in salaries and employee benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $141,000 and $185,000,\nrespectively, of stock-based compensation. Also included in stock-based compensation were $337,000 and $181,000 in stock grants to Company directors\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\ns. Federal Home Loan Bank stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock - As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB), the Company\nis required to maintain an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB. In addition, as a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRB), the\nCompany is required to maintain an investment in capital stock of the FRB. The investments in both the FHLB and the FRB are carried at cost in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets, are included in other assets, and are subject to certain redemption requirements by the FHLB and FRB. Stock\nredemptions are at the discretion of the FHLB and FRB.\nWhile technically these are considered equity securities, there is no market for the FHLB or FRB stock; therefore, the shares are considered restricted\ninvestment securities. Management periodically evaluates the stock for other-than-temporary impairment through an assessment of the ultimate\nrecoverability of cost rather than the recognition of temporary declines in value. The determination of the ultimate recoverability of cost is based upon (i)\nthe significance and length of time of any decline in net assets of the FHLB or FRB as compared to the capital stock amount of the FHLB or FRB, (ii\ncommitments by the FHLB or FRB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating\nperformance of the FHLB or FRB, (iii) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions, and (iv) the liquidity position of the FHLB or FRB.\nt. Comprehensive income (loss) - Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive\nincome (loss) includes items recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale, unrecognized costs of salary\ncontinuation defined benefit plans, and unrealized gains and losses on trust preferred securities related to instrument-specific credit risk. Comprehensive\nincome (loss) is presented in the “Consolidated Statements of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).”\nu. Segment reporting - The Company’s operations solely in the financial services industry and provides its customers traditional banking and other financial\nservices. The Company operates primarily in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Management’s operating decisions and performance assessment are based on\nan ongoing review of the Company’s consolidated financial results. The Company is considered one operating segment for financial reporting purposes.\nv. Revenue from contracts with customers - The Company records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from\nContracts with Customers” (Topic 606). Under Topic 606, the Company must identify the contract with a customer, identify the performance obligations in\nthe contract, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognize revenue when (or\nas) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company’s primary sources of revenue are derived from interest earned on loans, investment\nsecurities, and other financial instruments that are not within the scope of Topic 606. The Company has evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers\nand determined that further disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers into more granular categories beyond what is presented in the\n“Consolidated Statements of Income” is not warranted. The Company, in general, satisfies its performance obligations on its contracts with customers as\nservices are rendered. Transaction prices are typically fixed and are charged either on a periodic basis or as activity warrants. Contracts evaluated under the\nscope of Topic 606 are primarily related to service charges, fees on deposit accounts, debit card fees, ITM processing fees, and other service charges,\ncommissions and fees. Because performance obligations are\n55\nTable of Contents\nsatisfied as services are rendered and the transaction prices are fixed, there is little judgment involved in applying Topic 606 to the determination of the\namount and timing of revenue from contracts with customers.\nw. Leases - The Company recognizes lease assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Disclosures related to key lease components and\nleasing arrangements are included within the footnotes. The Company combines lease and associated non-lease components by class of underlying asset in\ncontract that meet certain criteria. The lease and related non-lease components have the same timing and pattern of transfer, and the lease component,\nwhen accounted for on a stand-alone basis, is classified as an operating lease.\nx. Recently Issued Accounting Standards -\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on\nFinancial Instruments,” which replaces the current “incurred loss” model for recognizing credit losses with an “expected loss” model referred to as the\ncurrent expected credit loss, or CECL, model. The CECL model applies to estimated credit losses on loans receivable, held-to-maturity debt securities,\nunfunded loan commitments, and certain other financial assets measured at amortized cost. Under ASU 2016-13, available-for-sale debt securities are\nevaluated for impairment if fair value is less than amortized cost, with any estimated credit losses recorded through a credit loss expense and an allowance,\nrather than a write-down of the investment. Changes in fair value that are not credit-related will continue to be recorded in other comprehensive income\n(loss). The Company adopted this standard using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at January\n1, 2023. While the Company held no other-than-temporarily-impaired securities at that time, a prospective transition was required for debt securities\npreviously classified as such. The Company is phasing the regulatory capital impact of Topic 326 over three years.\nThe following table summarized the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 by loan category:\nAllowance for Impact to\ncredit losses as Allowance before allowance of\nreported under the adoption of adoption of ASU\n(In thousands) ASU 2016-13 ASU 2016-13 2016-13\nAssets:\nCommercial and industrial:\nCommercial and business loans $ 2,290 $ 954 $ 1,336\nGovernment program loans 2 2 —\nTotal commercial and industrial 2,292 956 1,336\nReal estate mortgage:\nCommercial real estate 2,735 659 2,076\nResidential mortgages 986 703 283\nHome improvement and home equity loans 2 2 —\nTotal real estate mortgage 3,723 1,364 2,359\nReal estate construction and development 4,129 3,408 721\nAgricultural 1,550 525 1,025\nInstallment and student loans 4,855 2,898 1,957\nUnallocated — 1,031 (1,031)\nAllowance for credit losses for all loans $ 16,549 $ 10,182 $ 6,367\nLiabilities:\nAllowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposures $ 805 $ 532 $ 273\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as credit loss expense (or reversal). Losses are charged against the allowance when management\nbelieves the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.\nIn March 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848).” This ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for contracts,\nhedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.\nThe ASU was effective for all entities as of\n56\nTable of Contents\nMarch 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848.” This ASU\namends ASU 2020-04 by extending the sunset provision for use of LIBOR as a reference rate until December 31, 2024, due to an extension of the intended\ncessation of USD LIBOR. During 2023, the Company chose to use the “Secured Overnight Financing Rate,” or SOFR, as a replacement for LIBOR. This\nchange resulted in minimal impact to junior subordinated debt and floating rate loans tied to LIBOR.\nIn March 2022, FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. This\nASU provides new guidance on the treatment of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) in relation to the adoption of the CECL model for the accounting for\ncredit losses (see note above regarding ASU 2016-13). Previous accounting guidance related to troubled debt restructurings is eliminated and new\ndisclosure requirements are adopted in regard to loan refinancing and restructurings made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties under the\nassumption that the CECL model will capture credit losses related to troubled debt restructurings. New disclosures regarding gross write-offs for financing\nreceivables by year of origination are also included in the update. This update has been adopted as of January 1, 2023. The Bank will no longer report\ntroubled debt restructurings or classify loans as such. TDRs previously recognized have been incorporated into the CECL methodology as it applies to loan\nloss reserves as of January 1, 2023.\ny. Subsequent events - Subsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.\nRecognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet,\nincluding the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. Nonrecognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about\nconditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date.\n2.

There were no losses recorded due to credit-related factors for the periods ended December 31, 2023 or\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale at December 31, 2023, by contractual maturity, are shown below:\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value\n(Carrying\n(In thousands) Amortized Cost Amount)\nDue in one year or less $ 12,610 $ 12,534\nDue after one year through five years 28,770 27,466\nDue after five years through ten years 60,018 50,579\nDue after ten years 2,505 2,501\nU.S. Government sponsored entities & agencies collateralized by mortgage obligations 100,486 88,185\n$ 204,389 $ 181,265\nActual cash flows may differ from contractual maturities because issuers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment\npenalties.

At December 31, 2023, the decline in fair value of the available-for-sale securities\nis attributed to changes in interest rates and not credit quality. These declines are primarily the result of the fast pace and large increases in interest rates during\nthe last two years, which have led to decreases in bond prices and increases in yields. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities, and because\nit is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider it necessary to\nprovide an allowance for any available-for-sale security at December 31, 2023.\n59\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $39,000 in unrealized gains related to one marketable equity security compared to an\nunrealized loss of $429,000 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company had no held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n3.

The Company’s participation loans with other financial institutions are primarily in the state of California.\nCommercial and industrial loans are generally made to support the ongoing operations of small- and medium-sized commercial businesses. Commercial and\nindustrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification and provide working capital, financing for the purchase of manufacturing plants and equipment,\nor funding for growth and general expansion of businesses. A substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable,\ninventory, leases, or other collateral, including real estate. While the remainder are unsecured, those extensions of credit are predicated upon the financial\ncapacity of the borrower. Repayment of commercial and industrial loans generally comes from the cash flow of the borrower.\nReal estate mortgage loans are secured by trust deeds on primarily commercial property and by trust deeds on single family residences. Repayment of real\nestate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower.\n• Commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise the largest segment of this loan category and are available on all types of income producing and\ncommercial properties, including: office buildings and shopping centers, apartments and motels, owner-occupied buildings, manufacturing facilities,\nand other properties. Commercial real estate mortgage loans can also be used to refinance existing debt. Commercial real estate loans typically receive\npayment from the borrower’s business operations, rental income associated with the real property, or personal assets.\n• Residential mortgage loans are provided to individuals to finance or refinance single-family residences. Residential mortgages are not a primary\nbusiness line offered by the Company, and a majority are conventional mortgages that were purchased as a pool.\n• Home improvement and home equity loans comprise a relatively small portion of total real estate mortgage loans. Home equity loans are generally\nsecured by junior trust deeds, but may be secured by 1st trust deeds.\nReal estate construction and development loans consist of loans for residential and commercial construction projects, as well as land acquisition and\ndevelopment, or land held for future development. Loans in this category are secured by real estate including improved and unimproved land, as well as single-\nfamily residential, multi-family residential, and commercial properties in various stages of completion. All real estate loans have established equity\nrequirements. Repayment on\n60\nTable of Contents\nconstruction loans generally comes from long-term mortgages with other lending institutions obtained at completion of the project or from the sale of the\nconstructed homes to individuals.\nAgricultural loans are generally secured by land, equipment, inventory and receivables. Repayment is from the cash flow of the borrower.\nInstallment loans consist primarily of student loans as well as loans to individuals for household, family, and other personal expenditures such as credit cards,\nautomobiles or other consumer items. See “Note 4 - Student Loans” for specific information on the student loan portfolio.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its customers. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit of $183.5 million and $190.2 million, respectively, and\nstandby letters of credit of $2.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. These instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on\nthe consolidated balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the involvement the Company has in off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and\nstandby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments. The Company applies the same credit policies as it does for on-balance\nsheet instruments.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Substantially\nall of these commitments are at floating interest rates based on the prime rate. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates\neach customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation.\nCollateral held varies but includes accounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing\nproperties.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\nLoans to directors, officers, principal shareholders and their affiliates are summarized below:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nAggregate amount outstanding, beginning of year $ 3,610 $ 13,100\nRetirement of director during 2022 — (8,899)\nNew loans or advances during year 825 980\nRepayments during year (1,396) (1,571)\nAggregate amount outstanding, end of year $ 3,039 $ 3,610\nUndisbursed commitments, end of year $ 1,525 $ 1,050\n61\nTable of Contents\nKey terms and conditions for loans to directors, officers, principal shareholders and their affiliates do not differ from those of other borrowers.\nPast Due Loans\nThe Company monitors delinquent and potentially problematic loans on an ongoing basis through weekly reports to the loan committee and monthly reports to\nthe Board of Directors.\nThe following is a summary of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees, at December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nAccruing\nLoans Loans Loans Loans 90 or\n30-60 Days 61-89 Days 90 or More Total Past Due More Days Past\nDecember 31, 2023 Past Due Past Due Days Past Due Loans Current Loans Total Loans Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 53,273 $ 53,273 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 74 74 —\nTotal commercial and industrial — — — — 53,347 53,347 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 386,134 386,134 —\nResidential mortgages — — — — 260,539 260,539 —\nHome improvement and home equity\nloans — — — — 36 36 —\nTotal real estate mortgage — — — — 646,709 646,709 —\nReal estate construction and development\nloans — — 11,390 11,390 116,554 127,944 —\nAgricultural loans — — 45 45 49,750 49,795 —\nInstallment and student loans 791 328 426 1,545 40,702 42,247 426\nTotal loans $ 791 $ 328 $ 11,861 $ 12,980 $ 907,062 $ 920,042 $ 426\nThe following is a summary of delinquent loans, net of unearned fees, at December 31, 2022 (in thousands):\nAccruing\nLoans 90 or Loans 90 or\nLoans 30-60 Loans 61-89 More Days Total Past Due More Days Past\nDecember 31, 2022 Days Past Due Days Past Due Past Due Loans Current Loans Total Loans Due\nCommercial and business loans $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 57,770 $ 57,770 $ —\nGovernment program loans — — — — 132 132 —\nTotal commercial and industrial — — — — 57,902 57,902 —\nCommercial real estate loans — — — — 398,115 398,115 —\nResidential mortgages — — — — 273,357 273,357 —\nHome improvement and home equity\nloans 8 — — 8 41 49 —\nTotal real estate mortgage 8 — — 8 671,513 671,521 —\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans — — 12,545 12,545 140,829 153,374 —\nAgricultural loans — — 108 108 52,614 52,722 —\nInstallment and student loans 546 642 252 1,440 43,219 44,659 252\nTotal loans $ 554 $ 642 $ 12,905 $ 14,101 $ 966,077 $ 980,178 $ 252\n62\nTable of Contents\nNonaccrual Loans\nThe following table presents the amortized costs of loans on nonaccrual status and accruing loans more than 90 days past due: December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNonaccrual Loans Nonaccrual Loans\nWith No Accruing Loans With No Accruing Loans\nAllowance For Total Nonaccrual 90 or More Days Allowance For Total Nonaccrual 90 or More Days\n(In thousands) Credit Losses Loans Past Due Credit Losses Loans Past Due\nReal estate construction and\ndevelopment loans 11,403 11,403 — 14,436 14,436 —\nAgricultural loans — 45 — — 108 —\nInstallment and student loans — — 426 — — 252\nTotal $ 11,403 $ 11,448 $ 426 $ 14,436 $ 14,544 $ 252\nThere were no remaining undisbursed commitments to extend credit on nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of its credit monitoring program, the Company utilizes a risk rating system which quantifies the risk the Company estimates it has assumed during the\nlife of a loan. The system rates the strength of the borrower and the facility or transaction, and is designed to provide a program for risk management and early\ndetection of problems.\nFor each new credit approval, credit extension, renewal, or modification of existing credit facilities, the Company assigns risk ratings utilizing the rating scale\nidentified in this policy. In addition, on an on-going basis, loans and credit facilities are reviewed for internal and external influences which might impact the\ncredit facility and warrant a change in the risk rating. Each loan credit facility is given a risk rating that takes into account factors that materially affect credit\nquality.\nWhen assigning risk ratings, the Company evaluates two risk rating approaches, a facility rating and a borrower rating as follows:\nFacility Rating:\nThe facility rating is determined by the analysis of positive and negative factors that may indicate that the quality of a particular loan or credit arrangement\nrequires that it be rated differently from the risk rating assigned to the borrower. The Company assesses the risk impact of these factors:\nCollateral - The rating may be affected by the type and quality of the collateral, the degree of coverage, the economic life of the collateral, liquidation value,\nand the Company’s ability to dispose of the collateral.\nGuarantees - The value of third party support arrangements varies widely. Unconditional guarantees from persons with demonstrable ability to perform are\nmore substantial than that of closely-related persons to the borrower who offer only modest support.\nUnusual Terms - Credit may be extended on terms that subject the Company to a higher level of risk than indicated in the rating of the borrower.\nBorrower Rating:\nThe borrower rating is a measure of loss possibility based on the historical, current and anticipated financial characteristics of the borrower in the current risk\nenvironment. To determine the rating, the Company considers at least the following factors:\n- Quality of management\n- Liquidity\n- Leverage/capitalization\n- Profit margins/earnings trend\n63\nTable of Contents\n- Adequacy of financial records\n- Alternative funding sources\n- Geographic risk\n- Industry risk\n- Cash flow risk\n- Accounting practices\n- Asset protection\n- Extraordinary risks\nThe Company assigns risk ratings to loans other than consumer loans and other homogeneous loan pools based on the following scale. The risk ratings are used\nwhen determining borrower ratings as well as facility ratings. When the borrower rating and the facility ratings differ, the lowest rating applied is:\n- Grades 1 and 2 – These grades include loans which are given to high-quality borrowers with high credit quality and sound financial strength. Key\nfinancial ratios are generally above industry averages and the borrower’s strong earnings history or net worth. These may be secured by deposit\naccounts or high-grade investment securities.\n- Grade 3 – This grade includes loans to borrowers with solid credit quality with minimal risk. The borrower’s balance sheet and financial ratios are\ngenerally in line with industry averages, and the borrower has historically demonstrated the ability to manage economic adversity. Real estate and\nasset-based loans assigned this risk rating must have characteristics which place them well above the minimum underwriting requirements for those\ndepartments. Asset-based borrowers assigned this rating must exhibit extremely favorable leverage and cash flow characteristics, and consistently\ndemonstrate a high level of unused borrowing capacity.\n- Grades 4 and 5 – These include “pass” grade loans to borrowers of acceptable credit quality and risk. The borrower’s balance sheet and financial ratios\nmay be below industry averages, but above the lowest industry quartile. Leverage is above and liquidity is below industry averages. Inadequacies\nevident in financial performance and/or management sufficiency are offset by readily available features of support, such as adequate collateral, or\ngood guarantors having the liquid assets and/or cash flow capacity to repay the debt. While the borrower may have recognized a loss over three or four\nyears, recent earnings trends, while perhaps somewhat cyclical, are improving and cash flows are adequate to cover debt service and fixed obligations.\nReal estate and asset-borrowers who fully comply with all underwriting standards and perform according to projections would be assigned this rating.\nThese also include grade 5 loans which are “leveraged” or on management’s “watch list.” While still considered pass loans (loans given a grade 5), the\nborrower’s financial condition, cash flow, or operations evidence more than average risk and short term weaknesses. These loans warrant a higher than\naverage level of monitoring, supervision, and attention from the Company, but do not reflect credit weakness trends that weaken or inadequately\nprotect the Company’s credit position. Loans with a grade rating of 5 are not normally acceptable as new credits unless they are adequately secured or\ncarry substantial endorsers/guarantors.\n- Grade 6 – This grade includes “special mention” loans which are loans that are currently protected but are potentially weak. This generally is an\ninterim grade classification and these loans will usually be upgraded to an “acceptable” rating or downgraded to a “substandard” rating within a\nreasonable time period. Weaknesses in special mention loans may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect the\nCompany’s credit position at some future date. Special mention loans are often loans which exhibit weaknesses inherent in the loan origination and\nloan servicing, and may have some technical deficiencies. The main theme in special mention credits is the distinct probability that the classification\nwill deteriorate to a more adverse class if the noted deficiencies are not addressed by the loan officer or loan management.\n- Grade 7 – This grade includes “substandard” loans which are inadequately supported by the current sound net worth and paying capacity of the\nborrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that may impair the regular liquidation of\nthe debt. When a loan has been downgraded to “substandard,” there exists a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain a loss if the deficiencies\nare not corrected.\n- Grade 8 – This grade includes “doubtful” loans which exhibit the same characteristics as the “substandard” loans. Additionally, loan weaknesses make\ncollection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of\nloss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to the advantage and strengthening\nof the loan, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status can be determined. Pending factors include a\n64\nTable of Contents\nproposed merger, acquisition, or liquidation procedures, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral, and refinancing plans.\n- Grade 9 – This grade includes loans classified “loss” which are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable\nassets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or\ndesirable to defer writing off the asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future.\nThe following table presents loans by class, net of deferred fees, by risk rating and period indicated as of December 31, 2023:\nRevolving Revolving\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - As of December 31, 2023 Loans Loans\nAmortized Converted to\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Cost Basis Term Loans Total\nCommercial and business\nPass $ 5,989 $ 5,066 $ 1,594 $ 810 $ 6 $ 939 $ 38,869 $ — $ 53,273\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 5,989 $ 5,066 $ 1,594 $ 810 $ 6 $ 939 $ 38,869 $ — $ 53,273\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nGovernment program\nPass $ — $ — $ — $ 8 $ — $ 66 $ — $ — $ 74\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ 8 $ — $ 66 $ — $ — $ 74\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate\nPass $ 40,929 $ 81,823 $ 52,019 $ 39,155 $ 60,626 $ 105,285 $ 501 $ — $ 380,338\nSpecial Mention — — — 5,796 — — — — 5,796\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 40,929 $ 81,823 $ 52,019 $ 44,951 $ 60,626 $ 105,285 $ 501 $ — $ 386,134\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nResidential mortgages\nNot graded $ — $ 24,835 $ 206,257 $ 2,260 $ — $ 8,969 $ — $ — $ 242,321\nPass 4,189 1,925 5,253 1,579 3,494 1,778 — — 18,218\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ 4,189 $ 26,760 $ 211,510 $ 3,839 $ 3,494 $ 10,747 $ — $ — $ 260,539\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nHome improvement and home equity\nNot graded $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 32 $ — $ — $ 32\nPass — — — — — 4 — — 4\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — — — — —\nTotal $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 36 $ — $ — $ 36\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\n65\nTable of Contents\nRevolving Revolving\nLoans Loans\nTerm Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year - As of December 31, 2023\nAmortized Converted to\n(In thousands) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 Prior Cost Basis Term Loans Total\nReal estate construction and development\nPass $ 27,951 $ 9,571 $ — $ 31,308 $ — $ 3,978 $ 43,734 $ — $ 116,542\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — 3,524 — 7,878 — — 11,402\nTotal $ 27,951 $ 9,571 $ — $ 34,832 $ — $ 11,856 $ 43,734 $ — $ 127,944\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nAgricultural\nPass $ 2,086 $ 4,163 $ 457 $ 2,958 $ 1,592 $ 12,574 $ 22,556 $ — $ 46,386\nSpecial Mention — 2,105 — 513 — 356 — — 2,974\nSubstandard — — — — — 45 390 — 435\nTotal $ 2,086 $ 6,268 $ 457 $ 3,471 $ 1,592 $ 12,975 $ 22,946 $ — $ 49,795\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInstallment and student loans\nNot graded $ 708 $ 250 $ 142 $ 74 $ 483 $ 38,519 $ 472 $ — $ 40,648\nPass 1,173 — — — — — — — 1,173\nSpecial Mention — — — — — — — — —\nSubstandard — — — — — 426 — — 426\nTotal $ 1,881 $ 250 $ 142 $ 74 $ 483 $ 38,945 $ 472 $ — $ 42,247\nCurrent period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,588 $ — $ — $ 2,588\nTotal loans outstanding (risk rating):\nNot graded $ 708 $ 25,085 $ 206,399 $ 2,334 $ 483 $ 47,520 $ 472 $ — $ 283,001\nPass 82,317 102,548 59,323 75,818 65,718 124,624 105,660 — 616,008\nSpecial Mention — 2,105 — 6,309 — 356 — — 8,770\nSubstandard — — — 3,524 — 8,349 390 — 12,263\nGrand total loans $ 83,025 $ 129,738 $ 265,722 $ 87,985 $ 66,201 $ 180,849 $ 106,522 $ — $ 920,042\nTotal current period gross\nwrite-offs $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,588 $ — $ — $ 2,588\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the credit risk ratings for commercial, construction, and other non-consumer related loans at December 31, 2022.

This loss measurement, which uses the\ncurrent expected credit loss (CECL) cohort methodology analysis, relies on segmenting the loan portfolio into pools with similar risks, tracking the\nperformance of the pools over time, and using the data to determine pool loss experience. Management estimates the allowance for credit loss balance using\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The\ncumulative loss rate used as the basis for the estimate of credit losses is comprised of the Company’s historical loss experience from 2006 to 2023. The\nCompany expects that the markets in which it operates will experience a slight decline in economic conditions and an increase in unemployment rates and\nlevels and trends of delinquencies over the next year. Management has adjusted the historical loss experience for these expectations.\nUnfunded loan commitment reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for unfunded loan commitments are\nincluded in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. Prior to adoption of ASC 326, provisions for unfunded loan commitments were\nincluded in other expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\n67\nTable of Contents\nThe following summarizes the activity in the allowance for credit losses by loan category for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands).\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction Installment &\nDecember 31, 2023 Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Unallocated Total\nBeginning balance $ 955 $ 1,363 $ 3,409 $ 525 $ 2,898 $ 1,032 $ 10,182\nCECL adjustment 1,336 2,359 720 1,025 1,959 (1,032) 6,367\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses\n(1) (390) (1,253) (515) (300) 3,888 — 1,430\nCharge-offs — — — — (2,588) — (2,588)\nRecoveries 2 55 — — 210 — 267\nEnding balance $ 1,903 $ 2,524 $ 3,614 $ 1,250 $ 6,367 $ — $ 15,658\n(1) Excludes a $30,000 provision for unfunded loan commitments during the year.\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Real Estate Construction and Installment &\nDecember 31, 2022 Industrial Mortgage Development Agricultural Student Loans Unallocated Total\nBeginning balance $ 597 $ 1,174 $ 2,840 $ 1,233 $ 2,720 $ 769 $ 9,333\nProvision for (reversal of) credit losses\n(1) 87 147 569 (744) 1,480 263 1,802\nCharge-offs 1 — — — (1,364) — (1,363)\nRecoveries 270 42 — 36 62 — 410\nEnding balance $ 955 $ 1,363 $ 3,409 $ 525 $ 2,898 $ 1,032 $ 10,182\n(1) Includes a $137,000 reversal of provision for unfunded loan commitments during the year.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans\nA loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through\nthe operation or sale of the collateral.\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in collateral-dependent loans by type of loan:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Number of\nCollateral- Collateral-\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Dependent Loans Amount Dependent Loans\nReal estate construction and development loans $ 11,390 3 $ 14,436 4\nAgricultural loans 390 1 108 2\nTotal $ 11,780 4 $ 14,544 6\nAt December 31, 2023, two of the real estate and construction and development loans were secured by land and one was secured by a multifamily property, and\nthe agricultural loan was secured by farmland. At December 31, 2022, three of the real estate and construction and development loans were secured by land and\none was secured by a multifamily property, and the agricultural loan was secured by farmland.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposure relates to commitments to extend credit, letters of credit, and undisbursed funds on lines of credit. The\nCompany evaluates credit risk associated with the off-balance sheet loan commitments in the same manner as it evaluates credit risk within the loan portfolio.\nThe reserve for the unfunded loan commitments is a liability on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and is included in other liabilities.\n68\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents the impact to the unfunded commitments liability after the adoption of CECL:\n12/31/2023 12/31/2022\nBeginning Liability $ 532 $ 669\nCECL Day 1 Adjustment 273 —\nProvision (Reversal of Provision) 30 (137)\nEnding Liability $ 835 $ 532\nLoan Modifications\nOccasionally, the Company modifies loans to borrowers in financial distress by providing principal forgiveness, term extension, and other-than-insignificant\npayment delay or interest rate reduction. When principal forgiveness is provided, the amount of forgiveness is charged off against the allowance for credit\nlosses. There were no loan modifications at December 31, 2023.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, loan modifications were classified as troubled debt restructurings. When the Company granted a concession to a\nborrower as part of a loan restructuring, the restructuring was accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). TDRs were reported as a component of\nimpaired loans.\nA TDR was a type of restructuring in which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, granted a concession\n(either imposed by court order, law, or agreement between the borrower and the Bank) to the borrower that it would not otherwise have considered. Although\nthe restructuring took different forms, the Company’s objective was to maximize recovery of its investment by granting relief to the borrower.\nThere were no TDR modifications or defaults during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following tables summarizes all TDR activity by loan category for the years ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands).\nReal Estate\nCommercial and Commercial Real Residential Home Improvement Construction Installment\n2022 Industrial Estate Mortgages and Home Equity Development Agricultural and Student Loans Total\nBeginning balance $ — $ — $ 146 $ — $ 2,206 $ 242 $ — $ 2,594\nDefaults — — — — — — — —\nAdditions — — — — — — — —\nPrincipal reductions — — (6) — (330) (134) — (470)\nCharge-offs — — — — — — — —\nEnding balance $ — $ — $ 140 $ — $ 1,876 $ 108 $ — $ 2,124\nAllowance for loan loss $ — $ — $ 4 $ — $ — $ 48 $ — $ 52\nThe Company made various types of concessions when structuring TDRs including rate reductions, payment extensions, and forbearance. At December 31,\n2022, the Company had 4 restructured loans totaling $2.1 million. The Company had no unfunded commitments outstanding for TDRs at December 31, 2022.\n4. Student Loans\nIncluded in installment loans are $38.5 million and $42.1 million in student loans at December 31, 2023 and 2022, made to medical and pharmacy school\nstudents. Upon graduation the loan is automatically placed on deferment for six months. This may be extended up to 48 months for graduates enrolling in\ninternship, medical residency, or fellowship. As approved, the student may receive additional deferment for hardship or administrative reasons in the form of\nforbearance for a maximum of 36 months throughout the life of the loan. Student loans have not been originated or purchased since 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the allowance for credit losses for the student loan portfolio was $6.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, student loans totaling $426,000 and $252,000 were included in the substandard category, respectively.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the credit quality indicators for outstanding student loans as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Principal Accrued Number of Principal Accrued\n(In thousands, except number of loans) Loans Amount Interest Loans Amount Interest\nSchool 44 $ 1,242 $ 734 70 $ 2,056 $ 908\nGrace 18 473 296 27 667 348\nRepayment 444 20,833 289 516 23,414 857\nDeferment 237 10,163 2,022 268 10,974 1,732\nForbearance 98 5,782 133 91 5,019 237\nTotal 841 $ 38,493 $ 3,474 972 $ 42,130 $ 4,082\nSchool - The time in which the borrower is still actively in school at least half time. No payments are expected during this stage, though the borrower may\nbegin immediate payments.\nGrace - A six month period of time granted to the borrower immediately upon graduation, or withdrawal from school. Interest continues to accrue. Upon\ncompletion of the six month grace period the loan is transferred to repayment status. This status may also represent a borrower activated to military duty during\ntheir time in school. The borrower must return to at least half-time status within six-months of the active duty end-date in order to return to in-school status.\nRepayment - The time in which the borrower is no longer actively in school at least half time, and has not received an approved grace, deferment, or\nforbearance. Regular payment is expected from these borrowers under an allotted payment plan.\nDeferment - May be granted up to 48 months for borrowers who have begun the repayment period on their loans but are (1) actively enrolled in an eligible\nschool at least half time, or (2) are actively enrolled in an approved and verifiable medical residency, internship, or fellowship program.\nForbearance - The period of time during which the borrower may postpone making principal and interest payments due to hardship or administrative reasons.\nInterest continues to accrue on loans during periods of authorized forbearance. If the borrower is delinquent at the time the forbearance is granted, accrued and\nunpaid interest from the date of delinquency, if any, will be capitalized at the end of the forbearance period. The loan-term will not change and payments may\nbe increased to allow the loan to pay off in the required time frame. A forbearance that results in and insignificant payment delay is not considered a\nconcessionary change in terms, provided the borrower affirms the obligation. Forbearance is not an uncommon status designation; this designation is standard\nindustry practice, and is consistent with a student’s migration to the medical profession. However, additional risk is associated with this designation.\nStudent Loan Aging\nStudent loans are generally charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 120 days contractually past due. Accrued but unpaid interest\nrelated to charged off student loans is reversed and charged against interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2023, $252,000 in accrued interest\nreceivable was reversed due to charge-offs of $2.6 million within the student loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2022, $141,000 in accrued\ninterest receivable was reversed due to charge-offs of $1.3 million within the student loan portfolio.\nThe following tables summarize the student loan aging for loans in repayment and forbearance as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNumber of Principal Number of Principal\n(Dollars in thousands) Borrowers Amount Borrowers Amount\nCurrent or less than 31 days 221 $ 25,070 251 $ 26,993\n31 - 60 days 6 791 8 546\n61 - 90 days 2 328 5 642\nGreater than 90 days 3 426 4 252\nTotal 232 $ 26,615 268 $ 28,433\n70\nTable of Contents\n5.

Investment in Limited Partnership\nThe Bank owns a 2.22% interest in a limited partnership which provides private capital for small to mid-sized businesses used to finance later stage growth,\nstrategic acquisitions, ownership transitions, and recapitalizations, or mezzanine capital. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total investment in\nthis limited partnership was $3.2 million, and $2.8 million, respectively. The investment is accounted for under the cost method. No income was received from\nthe partnership during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $566,000 was recognized and reflected in non-interest\nincome on the consolidated statement of income. Remaining unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $800,000 and $1.2 million,\nrespectively.\n7.

The\nrates paid on these deposits were similar to those customarily paid to the Bank’s customers in the normal course of business.\nThere were no brokered deposits held at December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\n8. Short-term Borrowings/Other Borrowings\nThe Bank maintains lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Home Loan Bank, and corespondent banks which may be drawn upon, as\nneeded, to cover short-term financial obligations, or for investment or capital utilization purposes.\nThe following table sets forth the Bank’s outstanding and available credit lines for the periods indicated:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nUnsecured credit lines:\nCredit limit $ 80,000 $ 120,000\nBalance outstanding 2,000 —\nFederal Home Loan Bank:\nCredit limit 128,935 2,151\nBalance outstanding 60,000 —\nCollateral pledged 232,144 2,307\nFederal Reserve Bank:\nCredit limit 463,501 435,599\nBalance outstanding — —\nCollateral pledged 608,045 590,427\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s available lines of credit totaled $672.4 million. All lines of credit are on an “as available” basis and can be revoked by\nthe grantor at any time. These lines of credit have interest rates that are generally tied to the Federal Funds rate or are indexed to short-term U.S. Treasury rates\nor SOFR. FHLB advances are collateralized by the Company’s stock in the FHLB and investment securities. At December 31, 2023, $230.1 million in loans\nand $2.1 million in investment securities were pledged as collateral for FHLB advances. Additionally, $604.0 million in loans and $4.1 million in investment\nsecurities were pledged at December 31, 2023 as collateral for advances with the Federal Reserve Bank.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s available lines of credit totaled $557.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, $2.3 million in investment securities at FHLB\nwere pledged as collateral for FHLB advances. Additionally, $590.4 million in real-estate secured loans were pledged at December 31, 2022, as collateral at the\nFederal Reserve Bank.\n72\nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had secured borrowings of $60.0 million at FHLB with a maturity date of January 18, 2024, and overnight unsecured\nborrowings of $2.0 million at PCBB. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowing balances.\n9. Leases\nThe Company leases land and premises for its branch banking offices, administration facilities, and ITMs. The initial terms of these leases expire at various\ndates through 2032. Under the provisions of most of these leases, the Company has the option to extend the leases beyond their original terms at rental rates\nadjusted for changes reported in certain economic indices or as reflected by market conditions. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the\nlease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 13 operating leases and no financing\nleases.\nUpon adoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases, the Bank chose to apply the incremental borrowing rate in its determination of the lease liability.

Junior Subordinated Debt/Trust Preferred Securities\nThe contractual principal balance of the Company’s debentures relating to its trust preferred securities is $12 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nCompany may redeem the junior subordinated debentures at any time at par.\nThe Company accounts for its junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II at fair value. The Company believes the election of fair value\naccounting for the junior subordinated debentures better reflects the true economic value of the debt instrument on the consolidated balance sheet. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the rate paid on the junior subordinated debt issued under USB Capital Trust II is 3-month SOFR plus 129 basis points, and is adjusted\nquarterly.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company performed a fair value measurement analysis on its junior subordinated debt using a cash flow model approach to\ndetermine the present value of those cash flows. The cash flow model utilizes the forward 3-month SOFR curve to estimate future quarterly interest payments\ndue over remaining life of the debt instrument. These cash flows are discounted at a rate which incorporates a current market rate for similar-term debt\ninstruments, adjusted for additional credit and liquidity risks associated with junior subordinated debt. The 6.14% discount rate used represents what a market\nparticipant would consider under the circumstances based on current market assumptions. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the total cumulative\ngain recorded on the debt was $1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet fair value calculation (loss) gain $ (270) $ 413\nOther comprehensive income (loss) gain (544) 2,947\nRecognized gain (loss) on fair value 274 (2,533)\nCumulative gain recorded 1,461 1,732\nDiscount rate 6.14 % 6.63 %\nThe net fair value calculation performed as of December 31, 2023 resulted in a pretax loss adjustment of $270,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023,\ncompared to a pretax gain adjustment of $413,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the $270,000 fair value loss adjustment was separately presented as a $274,000 gain recognized on the consolidated\nstatements of income, and a $544,000 loss associated with the instrument-specific credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the $413,000 fair value gain adjustment was separately presented as a $2.5 million loss recognized on the consolidated statements of\nincome, and a $2.9 million gain associated with the instrument-specific credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company calculated the\nchange in the discounted cash flows based on updated market credit spreads for the periods ended.\n74\nTable of Contents\n11.

Under the\nguidelines, an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be\nsustained on examination. The term “more likely than not” means a likelihood of more than 50 percent. In assessing whether the more-likely-than-not criterion\nis met, the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority and all available information is known to the taxing\nauthority. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has no uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the U.S federal jurisdiction and California. There are no filings in foreign jurisdictions. The\nCompany is no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before 2020 and 2019 for Federal and California jurisdictions,\nrespectively.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized during\nthe periods ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were insignificant.\n12. Stock Based Compensation\nOptions and restricted stock units and awards have been granted to directors, officers and key employees at an exercise price equal to estimated fair value at the\ndate of grant as determined by the Board of Directors. All options, units, and awards granted are service awards, and are based solely upon fulfilling a requisite\nservice period (the vesting period). At December 31, 2023, the Company had one shareholder approved stock based compensation plan.\nIn May 2015, the Company adopted the United Security Bancshares 2015 Equity Incentive Award Plan (2015 Plan). The 2015 Plan provides for the granting of\nup to 758,000 shares of authorized and unissued shares of common stock in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. The\n2015 Plan requires that the exercise price may not be less than the fair value of the stock at the date the option is granted, and that the option price must be paid\nin-full at the time it is exercised.\nThe options granted (incentive stock options for employees and non-qualified stock options for Directors) have an exercise price at the prevailing market price\non the date of grant. All options granted are exercisable 20% each year commencing one year after the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant.\nRestricted stock units are granted at the prevailing market price of the Company’s stock, subject to time-based vesting. Restricted stock awards are subject to\nforfeiture if employment terminates prior to vesting. The cost of these awards is recognized over the vesting period of the awards based on the fair value of the\ncommon stock on the date of the grant.\nUnder the 2015 Plan, 96,435 granted stock instruments are outstanding as of December 31, 2023, of which 51,000 are exercisable. Of the 96,435 granted stock\ninstruments, 7,000 are restricted stock units, 14,435 are restricted stock awards, and 75,000 are nonqualified stock options.\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 411,590 shares available for future issuance under equity compensation plans.\n76\nTable of Contents\nA summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plan and changes during the year are presented below:\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nWeighted Average Contractual Term Aggregate\nShares Exercise Price (Years) Intrinsic Value\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2021 94,601 $ 7.87\nGranted during the year 30,000 8.17\nExercised during the year (5,579) 5.22\nForfeited during the year — —\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2022 119,022 8.07 4.78 $ 105,334\nGranted during the year — —\nExercised during the year (29,022) 3.68\nForfeited during the year (15,000) 9.25\nOptions outstanding December 31, 2023 75,000 $ 9.54 5.50 $ 7,200\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022 there was $78,000 and $104,000, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock\noptions.

There were no outstanding\nrestricted stock awards at December 31, 2022. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 4.93 years.\nIncluded in total outstanding options at December 31, 2023, are 51,000 exercisable shares at a weighted average price of $7.01, a weighted average remaining\ncontract term of 4.28 and intrinsic value of $1,440.\nIncluded in salaries and employee benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are $141,000 and $185,000 of stock-based compensation,\nrespectively. Director’s fees totaling $337,000 and $181,000 for the same periods, respectively, are also included in stock-based compensation as reflected in\nthe Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. The related tax benefit on share-based compensation recorded in the provision for income\ntaxes was not material to any year.\nA summary of the status of the Company’s stock option values and activity is presented below:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWeighted average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted $ — $ 127,644\nWeighted average fair value of stock options vested $ 26,000 $ 86,000\nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 85,000 $ 10,555\nThe Bank determines fair value of stock options at grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant\ndate, the exercise price, the expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock and the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate over\nthe expected life of the option. The Bank determines fair value of restricted stock based on the quoted stock price as of the grant date.\nThe expected term of options granted is derived from management’s experience, which is based upon historical data on employee exercise and post-vesting\nbehavior. The risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Bank’s stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the options. The Company\nbelieves that historical volatility is indicative of expectations about its future volatility over the expected term of the options. The Bank expenses the fair value\nof the option on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for each separate service period portion of the award.\nThe fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of the grant date:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRisk-free interest rate — % 1.23 %\nExpected term in years 0 10\nExpected stock price volatility — % 41.63 %\nDividend yield — —\nThe Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock based award and\nstock price volatility. The assumptions listed above represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the\napplication of management judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, the Bank’s recorded stock-based compensation expense could have been\nmaterially different from that previously reported in proforma disclosures.\n13. Employee Benefit Plans\n401K Plan\nThe Company has a Cash or Deferred 401(k) Stock Ownership Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) organized under Section 401(k) of the Code. All employees of the\nCompany are initially eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan upon the first day of the month after date of hire. Under the terms of the plan, the participants\nmay elect to make contributions to the 401(k) Plan as determined by the Board of Directors. Participants are automatically vested 100% in all employee\ncontributions. Participants may direct the investment of their contributions to the 401(k) Plan in any of several authorized investment vehicles. The Company\ncontributes\n78\nTable of Contents\nfunds to the Plan up to 4% of the employees’ eligible annual compensation. Company contributions are immediately 100% vested at the time of contribution.\nThe Company made matching contributions of $282,000 and $263,000 to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nSalary Continuation Plan\nThe Company has an unfunded, non-qualified Salary Continuation Plan for senior executive officers and certain other key officers of the Company, which\nprovides additional compensation benefits upon retirement for a period of at least 15 years. Future compensation under the Plan is earned by the employees for\nservices rendered through retirement and vests over a period of 12 to 32 years. As of December 31, 2023, the Company maintained a total of twelve Salary\nContinuation agreements.\nThe Company’s current benefit liability is determined based upon vesting and the present value of the benefits at a corresponding discount rate. The discount\nrate used is an equivalent rate for high-quality investment-grade bonds with lives matching those of the service periods remaining for the salary continuation\ncontracts, which averages approximately 20 years. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, $4,255,000 and $4,245,000, respectively, had been accrued to date, based\non a discounted cash flow using an average discount rate of 5.30% and 4.83%, respectively, and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance\nsheets. Salary continuation expense is included in salaries and benefits expense, and totaled $314,000 and $310,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nIncluded within the twelve total Salary Continuation agreements, the Company has four separate agreements with officers of the Bank and accrues for this\nsalary continuation liability based on anticipated years of service and vesting schedules provided under the individual agreements. The four policies are\nconsidered individual contracts, and the Company applies guidance contained in ASC Topic 710. Additionally, the Company purchased company owned life\ninsurance (COLI) and bank owned life insurance policies (BOLI) on the life of the officers in connection with the salary continuation agreements. The COLI\npolicy premiums were paid over a seven year period and the BOLI policy premiums were paid in whole upon purchase of the policies. There was no premium\nexpense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nFor the other eight Salary Continuation agreements in place prior to 2015, the Company recognizes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, the\namounts that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs, per the guidance contained in ASC Topic 715 “Compensation”. These\nunrecognized costs arise from changes in estimated interest rates used in the calculation of net liabilities under the Plan. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Company had approximately $130,000 and $195,000, respectively in unrecognized net periodic benefit costs arising from changes in interest rates used in\ncalculating the current post-retirement liability required under the Plan. This amount represents the difference between the plan liabilities calculated under net\npresent value calculations, and the net plan liabilities actually recorded on the Company’s books at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOfficer Supplemental Life Insurance Plan\nThe Company owns Bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLI) and Company-owned life insurance policies (COLI) on certain officers, including those\ncovered under the Salary Continuation Plan above, with a portion of the post-retirement benefit available to the officers’ beneficiaries. The BOLI and COLI\ninitial net cash surrender value is equal to the premium paid. Non-taxable increases in the cash surrender value, net of the cost of insurance, plus any death\nbenefits ultimately received by the Company, are recorded as income. The cash surrender value of the policies totaled $22.0 million and $22.9 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and are included on the consolidated balance sheet as cash surrender value of life insurance. Income, net of expense, totaled\n$557,000 and $555,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As the Salary Continuation Plan remains unfunded, it is the Company’s\nintention to utilize the policy proceeds to settle Plan obligations. Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the life insurance policies are the property of the\nCompany and are available, if necessary, to satisfy the Company’s creditors.\n14. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk: The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk which arise in the normal course\nof business. These instruments may contain elements of credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk, and include commitments to extend credit and standby\nletters of credit. The credit risk associated with these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to customers and is represented by\nthe contractual amount indicated in the table below:\n79\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nCommitments to extend credit $ 183,537 $ 190,183\nStandby letters of credit 2,940 1,570\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer, as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Substantially\nall of these commitments are at floating interest rates based on the prime rate, and most have fixed expiration dates. The Company evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis, and the amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation. Collateral\nheld varies but includes accounts receivable, inventory, leases, property, plant and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing properties. Many of\nthe commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and, as a result, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash\nrequirements of the Company.\nStandby letters of credit are generally unsecured and are issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers. The Company’s letters of credit are short-term\nguarantees and generally have terms from less than one month to approximately 3 years. At December 31, 2023, the maximum potential amount of future\nundiscounted payments the Company could be required to make under outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $2.9 million.\nRemaining unfunded commitments for the investment in limited partnership as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, totaled $800,000 and $1.2 million,\nrespectively.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in litigation arising out of its normal business activities. Management, after consultation\nwith legal counsel, believes that the ultimate liability, if any, resulting from the disposition of such claims would not be material to the financial position of the\nCompany.\n15. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\nThe following summary disclosures are made in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC Topic 825 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” which\nrequires the disclosure of fair value information for both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments where it is practicable to estimate that value.\nGAAP guidance clarifies the definition of fair value, describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles and expands fair value disclosure requirements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair\nvalue measurements.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\n• Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (as defined) for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to\naccess at the measurement date.\n• Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and reflect the reporting entity’s assumptions regarding the pricing of an asset or\nliability by a market participant (including assumptions about risk).\n80\nTable of Contents\nThe table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value\nmeasurements are categorized at the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices In\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nEstimated Fair for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable\n(In thousands) Carrying Amount Value Assets Level 1 Level 2 Inputs Level 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 181,266 $ 179,016 $ 12,438 $ 166,578 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 3,354 — —\nLoans, net 904,384 871,681 — — 871,681\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 71,848 71,414 — — 71,414\nShort-term borrowings 62,000 62,000 62,000 — —\nJunior subordinated debt 11,213 11,213 — — 11,213\nDecember 31, 2022\nQuoted Prices In\nActive Markets Significant Other Significant\nEstimated Fair for Identical Observable Inputs Unobservable\n(In thousands) Carrying Amount Value Assets Level 1 Level 2 Inputs Level 3\nFinancial Assets:\nInvestment securities $ 207,545 $ 207,545 $ 29,224 $ 178,321 $ —\nMarketable equity securities 3,315 3,315 3,315 — —\nLoans, net 969,996 906,050 — — 906,050\nFinancial Liabilities:\nTime deposits 58,048 57,056 — — 57,056\nJunior subordinated debt 10,883 10,883 — — 10,883\nThe Company performs fair value measurements on certain assets and liabilities as the result of the application of current accounting guidelines. Some fair\nvalue measurements, such as investment securities and junior subordinated debt are performed on a recurring basis, while others, such as impairment of loans,\nother real estate owned, goodwill and other intangibles, are performed on a nonrecurring basis.\n• Level 1 financial assets consist of money market funds and highly liquid mutual funds for which fair values are based on quoted market prices.\n• Level 2 financial assets include highly liquid debt instruments of U.S. Government agencies, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate debt\ninstruments, and debt obligations of states and political subdivisions, whose fair values are obtained from readily-available pricing sources for the\nidentical or similar underlying security that may, or may not, be actively traded.\n• Level 3 financial assets include certain instruments where the assumptions may be made by the Company or third parties about assumptions that\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between Level 1, 2, and 3 when a change in circumstances warrants a transfer. There were no transfers in or out of Level 1\nand Level 2 fair value measurements during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring and non-\nrecurring basis:\nInvestment Securities - Available-for-sale and marketable equity security values are based on open-market price quotes obtained from reputable third-party\nbrokers. Market pricing is based upon specific CUSIP identification for each individual security. To the extent there are observable prices in the market, the\nmid-point of the bid/ask price is used to determine the fair value of individual securities. If that data is not available for the last 30 days, a Level 2-type matrix\npricing-approach, based on\n81\nTable of Contents\ncomparable securities in the market, is utilized. Level 2 pricing may include the use of a forward spread from the last observable trade or may use a proxy\nbond, such as a TBA mortgage, to determine the price for the security being valued. Changes in fair market value are recorded through other-accumulated-\ncomprehensive-income as an unrecognized gain or loss on fair value.\nIndividually-Evaluated Loans - Fair value measurements for individually-evaluated loans are performed pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance and are\nbased upon either collateral values supported by third party appraisals or observed market prices. Collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment\nusing the fair value of the collateral. There were no individually-evaluated loans measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nOther Real Estate Owned - Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO)\nare measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property, resulting\nin a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized. No OREO properties\nwere measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nJunior Subordinated Debt - The fair value of the junior subordinated debt is based on a discounted cash flow model utilizing observable market rates and\ncredit characteristics for similar debt instruments. In its analysis, the Company uses characteristics that market participants would generally use, and considers\nfactors specific to the liability and the principal, or most advantageous, market for the liability. Cash flows are discounted at a rate which incorporates a current\nmarket rate for similar-term debt instruments, adjusted for credit and liquidity risks associated with similar junior subordinated debt and circumstances unique\nto the Company. The Company believes that the subjective nature of these inputs, credit concerns in the capital markets, and inactivity in the trust preferred\nmarkets, limit the observability of market spreads, requiring the junior subordinated debt to be classified at a Level 3 fair value.\nThe following table provides a description of the valuation technique, unobservable input, and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs for the\nCompany’s liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFinancial Valuation Unobservable Weighted Average Financial Valuation Unobservable Weighted Average\nInstrument Technique Input Instrument Technique Input\nJunior Discounted cash Market credit risk 6.14% Junior Discounted cash Market credit risk 6.63%\nSubordinated flow adjusted spreads Subordinated flow adjusted spreads\nDebt Debt\nManagement believes that the credit risk-adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated debentures is indicative of the\nnonperformance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current, inactive market conditions. Management attributes the change in fair\nvalue of the junior subordinated debentures to market changes in the nonperformance expectations and pricing of this type of debt. Generally, an increase in the\ncredit risk adjusted spread and/or a decrease in the forward three-month SOFR curve will result in a positive fair value adjustment and a decrease in the fair\nvalue measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the credit risk adjusted spread and/or an increase in the forward three-month SOFR curve will result in a\nnegative fair value adjustment and an increase in the fair value measurement. The decrease in discount rate between the periods ended December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, is primarily due to decreases in rates for similar debt instruments.\n82\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets Significant\nfor Identical Significant Other Unobservable\nDecember 31, Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 6,156 $ — $ 6,156 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 88,184 — 88,184 —\nMunicipal bonds 40,116 — 40,116 —\nU.S. Treasury securities 12,438 — 12,438 —\nCorporate bonds 32,122 — 32,122 —\nTotal AFS securities 179,016 — 179,016 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,354 3,354 — —\nTotal assets $ 182,370 $ 3,354 $ 179,016 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nTotal liabilities $ 11,213 $ — $ — $ 11,213\nThere were no non-recurring fair value adjustments at December 31, 2023.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2022:\nQuoted Prices\nin Active Significant\nMarkets for Other Significant\nIdentical Observable Unobservable\nAssets Inputs Inputs\n(In thousands) December 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets:\nAFS Securities:\nU.S. Government agencies $ 8,231 $ — $ 8,231 $ —\nU.S. Government collateralized mortgage obligations 97,218 — 97,218 —\nMunicipal bonds 40,170 — 40,170 —\nU.S. Treasury securities 29,224 — 29,224 —\nCorporate bonds 32,702 — 32,702 —\nTotal AFS securities 207,545 — 207,545 —\nMarketable equity securities 3,315 3,315 — —\nTotal assets $ 210,860 $ 3,315 $ 207,545 $ —\nLiabilities:\nJunior subordinated debt $ 10,883 $ — $ — $ 10,883\nTotal liabilities $ 10,883 $ — $ — $ 10,883\nThe were no non-recurring fair value adjustments at December 31, 2022.\n83\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of liabilities at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on a recurring basis during the years\nended:\nJunior Subordinated Debt (in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBeginning balance $ 10,883 $ 11,189\nTotal (gains) losses included in earnings (274) 2,533\nTotal gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income 544 (2,947)\nCapitalized interest 60 108\nEnding balance $ 11,213 $ 10,883\nThe amount of total (gains) losses for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or\nlosses relating to liabilities still held at the reporting date $ (274) $ 2,533\n16.

Investment in York Monterey Properties\nThe Bank wholly-owns the subsidiary, York Monterey Properties, Inc. (“Properties”), organized as a California corporation. The Bank capitalized the\nsubsidiary through the transfer of eight unimproved lots at a historical cost of $5.3 million comprised of approximately 186.97 acres in the York Highlands\nsubdivision of the Monterra Ranch residential development in Monterey County, California, together with cash contributions. The Bank transferred the\nproperties to York Monterey Properties, Inc., in order to maintain ownership beyond the ten-year regulatory holding period applicable to a state bank. The Bank\nacquired five of the lots through a non-judicial foreclosure on or about May 29, 2009. In addition, the Bank purchased three of the lots from another bank. The\nBank has continuously held the Properties since the date of foreclosure and acquisition until the time of transfer. At the time of transfer, the Properties had\nreached the end of the ten-year regulatory holding period limit.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Bank’s investment in York Monterey Properties, Inc. totaled $5.0 million. York Monterey Properties, Inc. is included\nwithin the consolidated financial statements of the Company, with $4.6 million of the total investment recognized within the balance of OREO on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n85\nTable of Contents\n20.

Regulatory Matters\nCapital Adequacy\nThe Company and Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the\nFDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandates and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if\nundertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework, the consolidated Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities, and\ncertain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative\njudgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding\ncompanies.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules, a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, includes quantitative measures designed to ensure capital\nadequacy. The Basel III Rules require the Company and the Bank to maintain:\n• (i) a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio minimum of 4.50 percent plus a 2.50 percent “capital conservation buffer,”\n• (ii) Tier 1 risk-based capital minimum of 6.00 percent plus the capital conservation buffer,\n• (iii) total risk-based capital ratio minimum of 8.00 percent plus the capital conservation buffer and,\n• (iv) Tier 1 leverage capital ratio minimum of 4.00 percent.\nThe capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and effectively increases the minimum required risk-weighted\ncapital ratios. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCommunity Bank Leverage Ratio: The federal banking agencies published a final rule on November 13, 2019, that provided a simplified measure of capital\nadequacy for qualifying community banking organizations. A qualifying community banking organization that opts into the community bank leverage ratio\nframework and maintains a leverage ratio greater than nine percent will be considered to have met the minimum capital requirements, the capital ratio\nrequirements for the well capitalized category under the Prompt Corrective Action framework, and any other capital or leverage requirements to which the\nqualifying banking organization is subject. A qualifying community banking organization with a leverage ratio of greater than nine percent may opt into the\ncommunity bank leverage ratio framework if it has average consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion, has off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of\ntotal consolidated assets, and has total trading assets and trading liabilities of five percent or less of total consolidated assets. Further, the bank must not be an\nadvance approaches banking organization.\n87\nTable of Contents\nThe final rule became effective January 1, 2020, and was adopted by the Bank on September 30, 2020. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCompany and Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject.\nThe following table shows the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital and regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2023 and 2022 as compared to the\napplicable capital adequacy guidelines:\nMinimum requirement for Community\nActual Bank Leverage Ratio (1)\n(In thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nAs of December 31, 2023 (Company):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) $147,350 11.82% $112,035 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2023 (Bank):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 147,249 11.83% $112,152 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2022 (Company):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 135,889 10.10% $121,064 9.00%\nAs of December 31, 2022 (Bank):\nTier 1 Leverage (to Average Assets) 135,930 10.11% $120,968 9.00%\n(1) If the subsidiary bank’s leverage ratio exceeds the minimum ratio under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework, it is deemed to be “well capitalized” under all\nother regulatory capital requirements. The Company may revert back to the regulatory framework for “Prompt Corrective Action” if the subsidiary bank’s leverage ratio falls\nbelow the minimum under the Community Bank Leverage Ratio Framework.\n22. Related Party Transactions\nDuring 2022, a member of the Board of Directors was hired to act as Chief Information Officer (CIO) on an interim basis, for which the director was paid a\nconsulting fee of $200,000. As a result, the director is currently not considered an independent director.\n23. Subsequent Events\nSubsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. Recognized subsequent events\nare events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the\nprocess of preparing financial statements. Nonrecognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of\nthe balance sheet but arose after that date. Management has reviewed events occurring through the date the financial statements were issued and no subsequent\nevents occurred requiring accrual or disclosure.\nItem 9 - Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nCONCLUSION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation\nof the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this evaluation, the Company’s management has\ndetermined that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures\ndesigned to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits is accumulated and communicated to\nmanagement, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\n88\nTable of Contents\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in\nExchange Act Rule 13a‑15(f). The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission as of December 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting is effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.

A significant contributor to this margin is our student\nloan portfolio, which has yielded 6.44% year-to-date, even after accounting for charge-offs. While the growth in our loan\nportfolio and the student loan charge-offs necessitated a larger provision for credit losses this quarter, we remain confident in\nthe strength of our credit quality.”\n1\nProvided at the end of this press release is a reconciliation of Core Net Income, as a non-GAAP measure, to Net Income.\nThis reconciliation excludes Non-Core items such as the Fair Value Adjustment for TRUPs.

Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $4.3 million and $0.25 per basic and diluted share.\nNet income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased 0.6% when compared to the quarter ended September 30,\n2023. The decrease is primarily the result of an increase of $1.2 million in deposit interest expense and a credit loss provision\nof $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $687,000 in short-term borrowing expense, an increase of $638,000 in loan and\nfee income, and a change of $1.5 million on the fair value of junior subordinated debentures (TRUPs). ROAE for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, was 11.63%, compared to 13.06% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. ROAA was 1.24%\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.21% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nThe annualized average cost of deposits was 1.18% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.71% for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits increased 13.3% between the periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, and 2024, from $598.7 million to $678.3 million, respectively. Included in the increase in interest-bearing\ndeposits are purchased brokered deposits with an average balance of $84.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank held no brokered deposits during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The annualized average cost of funds was\n1.38% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.13% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase\nwas due to an increase in yields on deposits, partially due to the purchase of brokered deposits, and short-term borrowings.\nNet interest income, before the provision for credit losses, was $11.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nrepresenting a $109,000, or 0.9%, decrease from the $11.9 million reported at September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest\nincome was driven by increases in interest expense on deposits, offset by decreases in interest expense on short-term\nborrowings and increases in loan-interest income. The Company’s net interest margin of 4.20% for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, increased from 4.09% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the net interest margin is\ndue to increases in yields on loans and investment securities, partially offset by increases in yields on interest-bearing deposits\nand short-term borrowings. Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, before the provision for credit\nlosses, increased $290,000 from the $11.5 million reported during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily due to\nincreases in loan and fee income and decreases in short-term borrowing expenses, partially offset by increases in interest\nexpense on deposits.\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $2.0 million, an increase of $1.9 million from the\n$114,000 in non-interest income reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to a\ngain of $661,000 recorded on the fair value of junior subordinated debentures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to a recorded loss of $811,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Noninterest income increased $506,000\nfrom the $1.5 million reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. This was primarily due to a gain of $661,000 on the fair\nvalue of junior subordinated debentures for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a loss of $225,000 for the\nquarter ended June 30, 2024.\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, totaled $7.1 million, reflecting a $517,000 increase over the\n$6.6 million reported for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and a $169,000 increase from the $7.0 million reported from\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024. The increase between the quarters ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, resulted partially\nfrom increases of $263,000 in data processing expenses and $150,000 in salaries and employee benefit expenses.\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, decreased to 52.47%, compared to 54.63% for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This amelioration was due to a combination of an increase in noninterest income resulting from a gain on\njunior subordinated debentures offset by increased noninterest expenses.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.6\nmillion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and $1.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The effective tax rate\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was 25.43%, compared to 28.8% and 28.9% for the quarters ended September 30,\n2023, and June 30, 2024, respectively.\n2\nNine months ended September 30, 2024:\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 14.6% to $12.3 million, compared to net income of $14.4\nmillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a $1.4 million increase in\ninterest expense on short-term borrowings, a $1.5 million increase in interest expense on deposits, and a $1.2 million increase in\nthe provision for credit losses, partially offset by an increase of $634,000 in interest income, a $694,000 change in the fair value\nof junior subordinated debentures (TRUPS), a $1.1 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, and a gain of $573,000\nrecorded on proceeds from life insurance. ROAE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 12.95%, compared to\n16.64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. ROAA was 1.36% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 1.52% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Both ratios were impacted by the decrease in net income in\n2024 compared to 2023.\nThe annualized average cost of deposits was 0.91% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.63% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 5.9% between the periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, and 2024, from $664.1 million to $624.7 million, respectively. The annualized average cost of funds was\n1.25% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.83% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The\nincrease was primarily due to increases in rates paid on deposits and short-term borrowings.\nNet interest income before the provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $35.0 million,\na decrease of $2.3 million, or 0.91%, from the $37.4 million reported for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The\nCompany’s net interest margin of 4.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, decreased from 4.32% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is due to increases in average deposit costs and\nshort-term borrowing costs and was partially offset by increases in yields on investment securities and loans. Loan yields\nincreased from 5.70% to 6.01% between the two periods while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.40% to\n1.97% between the two periods.\nNoninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $4.6 million, an increase of $2.0 million when\ncompared to the $2.6 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from a\ngain of $573,000 recorded on proceeds from life insurance and a $694,000 change in the fair value of TRUPs. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, a gain on the fair value of TRUPs of $141,000 was recorded, compared to a loss of\n$553,000 for the same period in 2023. The change in the fair value of TRUPs reflected in noninterest income was caused by\nfluctuations in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) yield curve. Other noninterest income increased $421,000\nbetween the two periods.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $20.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million\ncompared to $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a year-over-year comparative basis, noninterest\nexpense increased due to increases of $895,000 in professional fees and $477,000 in salaries and employee benefits.\nProfessional fees increased primarily due to increases in service contract expense related to information technology services.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased due to increases in salaries, group insurance expense, and stock compensation\nexpense.\nThe efficiency ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 52.96%, compared to 47.66% for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. This deterioration was due to a combination of a decrease in net interest income resulting\nfrom increased short-term borrowing and deposit expenses and an increase in noninterest expense.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\n$5.9 million for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 27.9%,\ncompared to 29.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets increased $44.3 million, or 3.7%, between December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024. Gross loan balances\nincreased $55.3 million, investment securities decreased $15.8 million, and total cash and cash equivalents increased $7.1\nmillion. Increases in gross loans included increases of $41.2 million in real estate mortgage loans, $16.8 million in agricultural\nloans, and $3.3 million in commercial and industrial loans, and were offset by decreases of $4.3 million in real estate\nconstruction and development loans and $1.9 million in installment loans. Declines in the investment portfolio were partially\nthe result of the maturity of $12.5 million in treasury securities, $8.9 million in paydowns, and a $5.8 million decrease in\nunrealized losses. Unfunded loan commitments decreased from $183.5 million at December 31, 2023, to $131.9 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024. OREO balances totaled $4.6 million at December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024.\n3\nTotal deposits increased $60.5 million, or 6.0%, to $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This was\ndue to increases of $103.7 million in interest-bearing deposits, offset by decreases of $43.1 million in noninterest-bearing\ndeposits. Included in the increase in interest-bearing deposits are $100.0 million in brokered DDA accounts purchased during\nthe second and third quarters of 2024. NOW and money market accounts increased $102.9 million, time deposits increased\n$10.2 million, and savings accounts decreased $9.5 million. In total, NOW, money market and savings accounts increased\n17.7% to $622.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $529.4 million at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing\ndeposits decreased 10.7% to $360.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $403.2 million at December 31, 2023. Core\ndeposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, NOW, money market, savings accounts, and time deposits less\nthan $250,000, decreased $49.3 million.\nShareholders’ equity at September 30, 2024, totaled $132.9 million, an increase of $10.3 million from the $122.5 million\nreported at December 31, 2023. The increase in equity was the result of $12.3 million in net income and a decrease of $3.8\nmillion in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by $6.2 million in dividend payments. At September 30,\n2024, accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled $11.2 million, compared to $15.0 million at December 31, 2023. The\ndecrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss was primarily the result of a decrease of $4.1 million in net unrealized losses\non investment securities. Changes in unrealized losses on the investment portfolio are attributed to changes in interest rates, not\ncredit quality. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell, any\nsecurities held at an unrealized loss.\nThe Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares declared a cash dividend on common stock of $0.12 per share on\nSeptember 24, 2024. The dividend is payable on October 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of October 7, 2024, and is\nincluded in other liabilities as of September 30, 2024. No assurances can be provided as to the amount and/or declaration and\npayment of future dividends, if any. The Company continues to be well-capitalized and expects to maintain adequate capital\nlevels.\nCredit Quality\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared\nto a provision of $587,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision recorded during 2024 was primarily\ndriven by charge-offs within the student loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs totaled $1.2 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to $1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and related primarily to student\nloans for both periods.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses totaled 1.69% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.70% at\nDecember 31, 2023. Management considers the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, to be adequate.\nNon-performing assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, loan modifications, other real estate owned through foreclosure\n(OREO), and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest, increased $974,000 between December 31, 2023, and\nSeptember 30, 2024, to $17.4 million. As a percentage of total assets, non-performing assets increased from 1.36% at\nDecember 31, 2023, to 1.39% at September 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets is primarily attributed to an\nincrease of $554,000 in nonaccrual loans, an increase of $368,000 in loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing, and\nthe addition of one loan modification with a balance of $52,000 at September 30, 2024. OREO balances remained at $4.6\nmillion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nAbout United Security Bancshares\nUnited Security Bancshares (NASDAQ: UBFO) is the holding company for United Security Bank, which was founded in 1987.\nUnited Security Bank is headquartered in Fresno and operates 13 full-service branch offices in Fresno, Bakersfield, Campbell,\nCaruthers, Coalinga, Firebaugh, Fowler, Mendota, Oakhurst, San Joaquin, and Taft, California.

The decrease is primarily the\nresult of an increase of $955,000 in interest expense on short-term borrowings and an increase of $601,000 in professional fees,\npartially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a $573,000 gain on proceeds from life insurance.\nROAE for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was 13.79%, compared to 16.49% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. ROAA was\n1.45% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 1.40% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Both ratios were impacted\nby the decrease in net income in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nThe annualized average cost of deposits was 0.79% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.71% for the quarter\nended June 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 15.7% between the periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2024,\nfrom $704.7 million to $594.1 million, respectively. The annualized average cost of funds was 1.24% for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024, compared to 0.85% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due to increases in rates paid on\ndeposits.\nNet interest income, before the provision for credit losses, was $11.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing a\n$982,000, or 7.9%, decrease from the $12.5 million reported at June 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was driven\nby increases in interest expense on short-term borrowings, offset by increases in loan-interest income and decreases in interest\nexpense on deposits. The Company’s net interest margin of 4.28% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, decreased from 4.35%\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is due to increases in average rates paid on deposits\nand increases in short-term borrowings, partially offset by increases in yields on loans and investment securities. Net interest\nincome for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, before the provision for credit losses, decreased $192,000 from the $11.7 million\nreported during the quarter ended March 31, 2024. This was primarily due to increases in deposit and short-term borrowing\nexpenses.\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, totaled $1.5 million, an increase of $506,000 from the $1.0 million in\nnon-interest income reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributed to a $573,000 gain on\nproceeds from life insurance. Noninterest income increased $464,000 from the $1.1 million reported for the quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024. This was primarily due to the gain on proceeds from life insurance.\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, totaled $7.0 million, reflecting a $766,000 increase over the $6.2\nmillion reported for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and a $235,000 increase from the $6.7 million reported from the quarter\nended March 31, 2024. The increase between the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 resulted partially from increases of\n$601,000 in professional fees. The increase in professional fees was due to increases in service contracts and consulting\nservices.\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, increased to 53.49%, compared to 45.76% for the quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023. This deterioration was due to a combination of a decrease in net interest income resulting from increased short-\nterm borrowing expenses and an increase in noninterest expense.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $1.75 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $1.80\nmillion for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and $1.70 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rate for\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024, was 28.94%, compared to 29.0% and 28.9% for the quarters ended June 30, 2023, and March\n31, 2024, respectively.\nSix months ended June 30, 2024:\nNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, decreased 19.8% to $8.5 million, compared to net income of $10.5 million\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily the result of a $2.1 million increase in interest expense on\nshort-term borrowings and a $294,000 increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by an increase of $527,000 in\nloan interest income and fees, an $875,000 decrease in the provision for income taxes, and a gain of $573,000 recorded on\nproceeds from life insurance. ROAE for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was 13.64%, compared to 19.32% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. ROAA was 1.42% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 1.68% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. Both ratios were impacted by the decrease in net income in 2024 compared to 2023.\n2\nThe annualized average cost of deposits was 0.75% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.58% for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. Average interest-bearing deposits decreased 14.3% between the periods ended June 30, 2023, and\n2024, from $697.3 million to $597.6 million, respectively. The annualized average cost of funds was 1.19% for the six months\nended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.68% for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to increases\nin rates paid on deposits and short-term borrowings.\nNet interest income before the provision for credit losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $23.2 million, a\ndecrease of $2.2 million, or 7.85%, from the $25.4 million reported for the same period ended June 30, 2023. The Company’s\nnet interest margin of 4.31% for the six months ended June 30, 2024, decreased from 4.43% for the six months ended June 30,\n2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is due to increases in average deposit costs and short-term borrowing costs and\nwas partially offset by increases in yields on investment securities and loans. Loan yields increased from 5.67% to 5.99%\nbetween the two periods while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased from 1.16% to 1.89% between the two periods.\nNoninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled $2.6 million, an increase of $111,000 when compared to\nthe $2.5 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2023. This increase resulted primarily from a gain of $573,000\nrecorded on proceeds from life insurance, offset by a $778,000 change in the fair value of TRUPs. For the six months ended\nJune 30, 2024, a loss on the fair value of TRUPs of $520,000 was recorded, compared to a gain of $258,000 for the same period\nin 2023. The change in the fair value of TRUPs reflected in noninterest income was caused by fluctuations in the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (SOFR) yield curve. Other noninterest income increased $365,000 between the two periods.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, noninterest expense totaled $13.7 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to\n$12.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. On a year-over-year comparative basis, noninterest expense increased\ndue to increases of $943,000 in professional fees and $327,000 in salaries and employee benefits. Professional fees increased\nprimarily due to increases in service contract expense related to information technology services. Salaries and employee\nbenefits expense increased due to increases in salaries, 401(k) expenses, and stock compensation expense.\nThe efficiency ratio for the six months ended June 30, 2024, increased to 53.22%, compared to 44.59% for the six months\nended June 30, 2023. This deterioration was due to a combination of a decrease in net interest income resulting from increased\nshort-term borrowing and deposit expenses and an increase in noninterest expense.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $4.3\nmillion for the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 28.9%, compared to\n29.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets increased $8.8 million, or 0.7%, between December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024. Gross loan balances increased\n$29.6 million, investment securities decreased $18.3 million, and overnight balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank\nincreased $2.5 million. Increases in gross loans included increases of $47.6 million in real estate mortgage loans, $5.6 million\nin commercial and industrial loans, and $3.8 million in agricultural loans, and was offset by decreases of $25.6 million in real\nestate construction and development loans and $2.1 million in installment loans. Declines in the investment portfolio were\npartially the result of the maturity of $12.5 million in treasury securities and $5.6 million in paydowns. Total cash and cash\nequivalents decreased $2.0 million between December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024. Unfunded loan commitments decreased\nfrom $183.5 million at December 31, 2023, to $165.7 million at June 30, 2024. OREO balances totaled $4.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, and June 30, 2024.\nTotal deposits increased $2.1 million, or 0.2%, to $1.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024. This was due to\nincreases of $32.5 million in interest-bearing deposits, offset by decreases of $30.3 million in noninterest-bearing deposits.\nIncluded in the increase in interest-bearing deposits are $50.0 million in brokered DDA accounts purchased during the second\nquarter of 2024. NOW and money market accounts increased $36.5 million, time deposits increased $2.5 million, and savings\naccounts decreased $6.5 million. In total, NOW, money market and savings accounts increased 5.7% to $559.4 million at\nJune 30, 2024, compared to $529.4 million at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 7.5% to $372.9\nmillion at June 30, 2024, compared to $403.2 million at December 31, 2023. Core deposits, which are comprised of\nnoninterest-bearing deposits, NOW, money market, savings accounts, and time deposits less than $250,000, decreased $2.8\nmillion.\nShareholders’ equity at June 30, 2024, totaled $127.4 million, an increase of $4.8 million from the $122.5 million reported at\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in equity was the result of $8.5 million in net income and a decrease of $165,000 in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by $4.2 million in dividend payments. At June 30, 2024, accumulated\n3\nother comprehensive loss totaled $14.9 million, compared to $15.0 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease in accumulated\nother comprehensive loss was primarily the result of an increase of $194,000 in the fair value of TRUPs, net of tax, partially\noffset by an increase of $43,000 in net unrealized losses on investment securities. The increase in the fair value of TRUPs was\ncaused by changes in market credit spreads during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Changes in unrealized losses on the\ninvestment portfolio are attributed to changes in interest rates, not credit quality. The Company does not intend to sell, and it is\nmore likely than not that it will not be required to sell, any securities held at an unrealized loss.\nThe Board of Directors of United Security Bancshares declared a cash dividend on common stock of $0.12 per share on\nJune 25, 2024. The dividend is payable on July 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of July 8, 2024, and is included in other\nliabilities as of June 30, 2024. No assurances can be provided as to the amount and/or declaration and payment of future\ndividends, if any. The Company continues to be well-capitalized and expects to maintain adequate capital levels.\nCredit Quality\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $192,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to a\nprovision of $598,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The provision recorded during 2024 was primarily driven by\ncharge-offs within the student loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs totaled $641,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to $902,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and related primarily to student loans for both periods.\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses totaled 1.61% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.70% at\nDecember 31, 2023. Management considers the allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2024 to be adequate.\nNon-performing assets, comprised of nonaccrual loans, loan modifications, other real estate owned through foreclosure\n(OREO), and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest, increased $844,000 between December 31, 2023, and\nJune 30, 2024, to $17.3 million. As a percentage of total assets, non-performing assets increased from 1.36% at December 31,\n2023, to 1.42% at June 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing assets is primarily attributed to an increase of $652,000 in\nnonaccrual loans, an increase of $100,000 in loans past due more than 90 days and still accruing, and the addition of one loan\nmodification with a balance of $92,000. OREO balances remained at $4.6 million at June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\nAbout United Security Bancshares\nUnited Security Bancshares (NASDAQ: UBFO) is the holding company for United Security Bank, which was founded in 1987.\nUnited Security Bank is headquartered in Fresno and operates 13 full-service branch offices in Fresno, Bakersfield, Campbell,\nCaruthers, Coalinga, Firebaugh, Fowler, Mendota, Oakhurst, San Joaquin, and Taft, California.
