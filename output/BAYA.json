The units will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and trade under the ticker symbol “BAYAU” beginning on December 15, 2023. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one right, with each right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon consummation of an initial business combination. After the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares and rights are expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the symbols “BAYA” and “BAYAR,” respectively. The offering is expected to close on December 19, 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nBayview Acquisition Corp is a blank check company whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While we will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region in our identification and acquisition of a target company, we intend to focus our search on businesses in Asia.\n\nChardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”) is acting as sole bookrunning manager of the offering. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.\n\nRegistration statements relating to these securities became effective on December 14, 2023. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\n\nThe offering is being made only by means of a prospectus. When available, copies of the prospectus relating to the offering may be obtained by contacting Chardan, 17 State Street, Suite 2130, New York, NY 10004.
