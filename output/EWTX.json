We look forward to sharing important updates on both our CIRRUS-HCM and CANYON Phase 2 programs over the coming months.” \n\n**Recent Highlights**\n\n** Muscular Dystrophy Program / Sevasemten **\n\n**Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Becker)**\n\nSevasemten is an orally administered first-in-class fast skeletal myosin inhibitor designed to protect unstable muscle against contraction-induced muscle damage in muscular dystrophies including Becker and Duchenne. There are currently no approved therapies for individuals with Becker, a serious genetic, progressive neuromuscular disorder with significant unmet need. \n\n**CANYON Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial in adults with Becker** : CANYON, the largest interventional Becker trial, includes 40 adults and 29 adolescents with a sevasemten treatment period of 12 months. The primary endpoint of CANYON is change from baseline in creatine kinase (CK) over the treatment period with additional measures collected, including North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), North Star Assessment for Muscular Dystrophies (NSAD), 100-meter timed test, biomarkers of muscle damage, MRI and patient-reported outcomes. The Company expects to report CANYON data in December 2024. \n\n**GRAND CANYON, a global pivotal cohort in Becker:** GRAND CANYON, an expansion of the CANYON placebo-controlled trial, is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohort to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sevasemten over 18 months in 120 adults with Becker. The primary endpoint of GRAND CANYON is change from baseline in NSAA. In addition, other functional assessments, biomarkers of muscle damage, MRI, patient-reported outcomes and safety will be assessed. Data from GRAND CANYON, if positive, could support a marketing application. To learn more, go to clinicaltrials.gov ([NCT05291091](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05291091%3Fterm%3Dedg-5506%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D2&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05291091&index=1&md5=019a4c82a3232410836013e30873d03b)) or the GRAND CANYON [microsite](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beckergcstudy.com&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=microsite&index=2&md5=a3e7b8c9e87753fe01dbbaa50d511479) : [https://www.beckergcstudy.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beckergcstudy.com%2F&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beckergcstudy.com&index=3&md5=4e83c7e12006779ab5c2309c0ef571ca). \n\n**MESA Phase 2 open label extension trial in adults with Becker:** The Company is advancing MESA, an open-label extension trial to assess the long-term effect of sevasemten in individuals with Becker. MESA provides continued access to sevasemten to participants who were previously enrolled in ARCH, or completed CANYON, GRAND CANYON, or DUNE. To date, MESA has enrolled 99% of eligible participants completing these prior trials. \n\n**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (Duchenne)**\n\n**LYNX Phase 2 trial in boys with Duchenne:** LYNX is a 2-part multi-center, dose-finding Phase 2 trial to evaluate the effect of sevasemten on safety, PK, and biomarkers of muscle damage in children aged 4 to 9 years with Duchenne treated with oral, once-daily sevasemten. The trial will also explore changes from baseline in functional measures such as NSAA, stride velocity 95 th centile (SV95C) and self-reported/caregiver-reported outcomes. \n\nThe Company plans to report LYNX data in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company will rely on LYNX data, along with data from the FOX trial of Duchenne children previously treated with gene therapy, to guide the design and powering of a Phase 3 trial in Duchenne, planned to be initiated in 2025. For more information on LYNX go to clinicaltrials.gov to learn more about this trial ([NCT05540860](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fct2%2Fshow%2FNCT05540860%3Fterm%3Dlynx%26draw%3D2%26rank%3D3&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT05540860&index=4&md5=dbb9fb3353e97ab0c135ad2e4a5f9909)). \n\n**FOX Phase 2 trial in boys with Duchenne (previously treated with gene therapy):** The Company is advancing FOX, a Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial to assess the effect of sevasemten over 12 weeks on safety, PK and biomarkers of muscle damage in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with Duchenne who have been previously treated with gene therapy. The trial will also explore changes in baseline in functional measures such as NSAA, SV95C and self-reported/caregiver-reported outcomes. There has been exceptional enthusiasm from the Duchenne community for this trial, evident in the Company’s ability to over-enroll the trial within two months. Go to clinicaltrials.gov to learn more about this trial ([NCT06100887](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06100887%3Fterm%3Dedg-5506%2520fox%26rank%3D1&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06100887&index=5&md5=258aa52ebbec2d306b909bda02906b05)). \n\n** Cardiovascular Program / EDG-7500 **\n\nEDG-7500 is a novel oral, selective, cardiac sarcomere modulator, specifically designed to slow early contraction velocity and address impaired cardiac relaxation associated with HCM and other diseases of diastolic dysfunction. Preclinical data in models of both obstructive and non-obstructive HCM suggest the ability to drive beneficial responses with a low risk of decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal. The Company is enrolling CIRRUS-HCM, a four-part, multi-center, open-label trial, in approximately 55 patients with HCM at up to 20 clinical sites in the U.S. The primary objective of Part A of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of EDG-7500. Other key outcome measures included pharmacokinetics (PK), LVEF, and resting and provocable left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. Parts B and C are evaluating safety and effects of multiple doses of EDG-7500 over 28 days in patients with obstructive or non-obstructive HCM. The Company expects to report CIRRUS-HCM 28-day data in the first quarter of 2025. To learn more about CIRRUS-HCM, visit clinicaltrials.gov, [NCT06347159 (Phase 2)](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fstudy%2FNCT06347159&esheet=54148419&newsitemid=20241107168709&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT06347159+%28Phase+2%29&index=6&md5=fe74b5b51f546d371b7da74e60337a0c). \n\n**Phase 1 Trial of EDG-7500:** During the quarter, the Company announced top-line data of EDG-7500 from the Phase 1 trial in healthy subjects and the single-dose arm of the Phase 2 CIRRUS-HCM trial in patients with obstructive HCM. In the placebo-controlled Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) trial (n=48), healthy subjects received single doses of EDG-7500, ranging from 5 to 300 mg. In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial (n=24), healthy subjects received 25 to 100 mg once daily for 14 days. EDG-7500 was well tolerated in both the SAD and MAD; there were no clinically meaningful changes or trends in vital signs, clinical chemistry, hematology, or electrocardiograms. There were no meaningful changes in LVEF for all SAD and MAD subjects across a broad range of EDG-7500 exposures. In the MAD, a half-life of approximately 30 hours was observed, and steady state was achieved in approximately 4 days after the start of once-daily dosing. Generally, dose proportional increases in exposure were observed in both SAD and MAD. \n\n**Phase 2 CIRRUS-HCM trial of EDG-7500** : In CIRRUS-HCM Part A, patients with obstructive HCM received a single dose of 50, 100 or 200 mg of EDG-7500. A 67% mean reduction in resting LVOT pressure gradient (LVOT-G) and a 55% mean reduction in provokable (Valsalva) LVOT-G were observed in patients receiving the 100 and 200 mg single doses. LVOT gradients less than 30 mmHg at rest and less than 50 mmHg with Valsalva were each observed in 60% of patients receiving a single dose of 100 or 200 mg of EDG-7500. Importantly, gradient reduction was achieved without a meaningful change in LVEF. Treatment with a single dose of EDG-7500 also led to a 64% mean reduction in NT-proBNP, a key biomarker of heart failure, in the 200 mg cohort. This reduction highlights the potential of our mechanism in the treatment of diseases of diastolic dysfunction, including non-obstructive HCM. \n\nAcross the Phase 1 and CIRRUS-HCM trials, no subjects had a meaningful change to LVEF or a reduction to below 50% across a broad range of EDG-7500 exposures. \n\n** Strengthened Engagement with the Scientific and Patient Communities **\n\nThe Company continued its education and outreach in the HCM and muscular dystrophy medical and patient communities. Presentations were made at the HCM Society Scientific Sessions and the 29th International Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society. The Company served in a leadership role at the Becker Education and Engagement Day (BEED) events in the US and in Europe in September. These were the largest events of their kind for the Becker community. The Company continues to sponsor and participate in numerous other clinician and patient-focused events. \n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n**Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities** were approximately $492.5 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\n**Research and development (R &D) expenses ** were $32.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $30.7 million for the immediately preceding quarter. The increase of $1.5 million was primarily driven by an additional $1.6 million in manufacturing expenses related to our sevasemten and EDG-7500 clinical trials and research programs and $1.5 million higher personnel related costs primarily driven by stock based compensation, offset by a $1.6 million decrease in clinical and clinical development activities for the EDG-7500 clinical programs related to the substantial completion of Phase 1 trial in the second quarter 2024 and a $0.1 million decrease in professional fees and other research costs. \n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) expenses ** were $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.4 million for the immediately preceding quarter. The increase of $0.8 million was driven by increased personnel-related costs primarily related to stock-based compensation. \n\n**Net loss and net loss per share** for the third quarter of 2024 was $34.1 million or $0.36 per share, compared to $31.5 million or $0.34 per share for the immediately preceding quarter. \n\n**About Edgewise Therapeutics**\n\nEdgewise Therapeutics is a leading muscle disease biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for muscular dystrophies and serious cardiac conditions.

The full WMS Congress program is available [here](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wms2024.com%2Fpage%2Fhome&esheet=54128738&newsitemid=20241001999394&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=1&md5=8db76798dec337769222de23199f8a97) . \n\nThe Edgewise symposium presentation and posters will be available on the Edgewise [website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fedgewisetx.com%2Fscience-pipeline%2Fposters-presentations%2F&esheet=54128738&newsitemid=20241001999394&lan=en-US&anchor=website&index=2&md5=5834ebddd64f161ebd35c87653c957e4) . \n\n**About Sevasemten for Becker and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophies**\n\nSevasemten is an orally administered small molecule designed to prevent contraction-induced muscle damage in dystrophinopathies including Becker and Duchenne. Sevasemten presents a novel mechanism of action designed to selectively limit the exaggerated muscle damage caused by the absence or loss of functional dystrophin. By minimizing the progressive muscle damage that leads to functional impairment, sevasemten has the potential to benefit a broad range of patients suffering from debilitating neuromuscular disorders. \n\nIn Becker, after completion of the two-year Phase 1 ARCH trial, the Company continues to advance sevasemten through the clinic with the Phase 2 CANYON trial, which is fully enrolled, evaluating safety and effects on function and biomarkers of muscle damage in adult males with Becker. The Company expects to report CANYON data in the fourth quarter of 2024. The CANYON trial has expanded to include an additional 120 adult participants in a pivotal cohort GRAND CANYON, which is currently enrolling in the United States, Europe, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. Data from GRAND CANYON, if positive, could support a marketing application. \n\nIn Duchenne, the Company is advancing its Phase 2 clinical trials, LYNX, assessing safety, pharmacokinetics and biomarkers of muscle damage, and FOX, which includes children and adolescents previously treated with gene therapy. The Company expects to report LYNX data in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company will rely on LYNX data, along with data from the FOX trial of Duchenne children previously treated with gene therapy, to guide the design and powering of a Phase 3 trial in Duchenne, planned to be initiated in the first half of 2025. \n\nFor more information on Edgewise’s clinical trials [https://edgewisetx.com/science-pipeline/clinical-trials/](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fedgewisetx.com%2Fscience-pipeline%2Fclinical-trials%2F&esheet=54128738&newsitemid=20241001999394&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fedgewisetx.com%2Fscience-pipeline%2Fclinical-trials%2F&index=3&md5=fff7ca94d3674be3be3f1e344f8bd91f) . \n\n**About Edgewise Therapeutics**\n\nEdgewise Therapeutics is a leading muscle disease biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for muscular dystrophies and serious cardiac conditions.

Therapeutics, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2017, and it is\nheadquartered in Boulder, Colorado. The Company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery,\ndevelopment and commercialization of innovative treatments for severe muscle diseases for which there is significant unmet\nmedical need. The Company’s lead product candidate, sevasemten (EDG-5506), is an orally administered small molecule\ndesigned to address the root cause of dystrophinopathies including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne) and Becker\nmuscular dystrophy (Becker). The Company is currently studying sevasemten in Phase 2 trials, which are being held in the\nU.S. and Israel and in certain countries in Europe and Australasia. In addition, the Company is enrolling a multipart Phase 2\ntrial with EDG-7500, for the potential treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The Company is using its\nproprietary drug discovery platform to develop a pipeline of precision medicine product candidates that target key muscle\nproteins and modulators to address a broad array of serious muscle disorders.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe board of directors of the Company discusses with management macroeconomic and geopolitical developments,\nincluding inflation, instability in the banking and financial services sector, tightening of the credit markets, the impact of the\nupcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration, international conflicts, public health pandemics, cybersecurity and\nsanctions so that the Company can be prepared to react to new developments as they arise. The board of directors and the\nmanagement of the Company are carefully monitoring these developments and the resulting economic impact on its financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has an accumulated deficit of $338.9 million and cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of\n$492.5 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s ability to fund ongoing operations is highly dependent upon raising\nadditional capital through the issuance of equity securities and issuing debt or other financing vehicles.\nOn June 16, 2023, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement (Sales Agreement) with BofA Securities, Inc. (BofA\nSecurities) under which the Company could offer and sell shares of common stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to\n$125,000,000 from time to time, through an “at the market offering” program (ATM Program) under which BofA Securities\nacted as sales agent. Effective January 19, 2024, the Company suspended and terminated the prospectus related to the\nCompany’s common stock (the ATM Prospectus) issuable pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement. As of the date of the\nsuspension of the ATM Prospectus, the Company had sold 7,560,068 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price\nof $7.93 per share. The gross proceeds were $59.9 million, and the net proceeds were $59.4 million after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions of $0.2 million and offering expenses of $0.3 million.\nOn January 23, 2024, the Company closed an underwritten registered direct offering of 21,818,182 shares of common\nstock at a public offering price of $11.00 per share (the January 2024 Offering). The aggregate gross proceeds from the\nJanuary 2024 Offering were $240.0 million, and the net proceeds were $231.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts\nand commissions of $7.5 million and offering expenses of $0.6 million.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (Leerink Sales Agreement)\nunder which the Company may offer and sell shares of common stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $175,000,000\nfrom time to time, through an “at the market offering” program (Leerink ATM) under which Leerink Partners LLC will act as\nsales agent. The Company has not yet offered or sold any shares of common stock related to the Leerink ATM.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s ability to secure capital is dependent upon success in developing its technology and product candidates.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that additional capital will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The issuance of\nadditional equity or debt securities will likely result in substantial dilution to the Company’s stockholders. Should additional\ncapital not be available to the Company in the near term, or not be available on acceptable terms, the Company may be unable\nto realize value from the Company’s assets or discharge liabilities in the normal course of business, which may, among other\nalternatives, cause the Company to delay, substantially reduce, or discontinue operational activities to conserve cash balances,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern,\nwhich contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of\nbusiness. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of assets\nand liabilities that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. The Company believes that the\n$492.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund\nits operations in the normal course of business and meet its liquidity needs through at least the next 12 months from the\nissuance of these financial statements.\nNOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates in one operating segment and, accordingly, no segment disclosures have been presented herein.\nAll equipment and other fixed assets are physically located within the United States.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash\nequivalents. Cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 primarily consist of money market funds and\ncash.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Periodically, the Company may maintain deposits in financial institutions in\nexcess of government insured limits. The Company believes that it is not exposed to significant credit risk as its deposits are\nheld at financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. The Company has not experienced any\nlosses on deposits since inception. The Company regularly invests excess cash with major financial institutions in money\nmarket funds, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper, all of which can be readily purchased and sold using\nestablished markets. The Company believes that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is\nmitigated based on the fact that many of these securities are of high credit rating.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain legal, professional, accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated with\nin-process equity issuances as deferred offering costs until such equity issuances are consummated. After consummation of the\nequity issuance, these costs are recorded as a reduction in the capitalized amount associated with\n11\nTable of Contents\nthe equity issuance. Should the equity issuance be abandoned, the deferred offering costs are expensed immediately as a\ncharge to operating expenses in the statement of operations. Deferred offering costs were $0.3 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Such costs are classified in other non-current assets in the accompanying\nbalance sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and\nequipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset, which is generally\nthree to seven years, and in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the\nterm of the lease.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). At\nthe inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique\nfacts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the balance\nsheet as Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and current and non-current lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not\nto recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company typically only includes an initial lease\nterm in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless\nthere is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its material leases on a quarterly basis.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease\npayments over the expected remaining lease term. Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term as an operating expense. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease\nprepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a\nresult, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow\non a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic\nenvironment.\nFor all asset classes of its leases, the Company has elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for\nexisting classes of underlying asset. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate are not include in the\nmeasurement of the lease liability.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value\nof such assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is evaluated based on the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash\nflows expected to result from use of the related asset compared to its carrying value. If impairment is recognized, the carrying\nvalue of the impaired asset is reduced to its fair value. There were no impairment charges or long-lived assets disposed of\nduring three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting.\nTemporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes\nand their tax bases.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years’ tax returns and for\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if such deferred tax\nassets are deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Historically, the\nCompany has not recognized these potential benefits in its financial statements and has fully reserved for such net deferred tax\nassets, as it believes it is more likely than not that the full benefit of these net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred\ntax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years. The Company evaluated its tax\npositions and determined it has no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024.\n12\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company is required to disclose information on all assets and liabilities reported at fair value that enables an\nassessment of the inputs used in determining the reported fair values. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC\nTopic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), establishes a hierarchy of inputs used when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained\nfrom sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are those that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the\ninputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information\navailable in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy applies only to the valuation inputs used in determining the reported\nfair value of financial instruments and is not a measure of the investment credit quality. The three levels of the fair value\nhierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1—quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2—other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates,\ncredit risk, etc.).\nLevel 3—significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of\nassets and liabilities).\nMarketable Securities, Available for Sale\nAll marketable securities have been classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair value, based upon quoted\nmarket prices. The Company considers its available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly,\nthe Company classifies its investments as short-term marketable securities, even though the stated maturity date may be\none year or more beyond the current balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses, net of any related tax effects, are\nexcluded from earnings and are included in other comprehensive income (loss) and reported as a separate component of\nstockholders’ equity until realized. Interest income, realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other than\ntemporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the\nspecific-identification method. The amortized cost of securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of\ndiscounts to maturity. In accordance with the Company’s investment policy, management invests in money market funds,\ncorporate bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and government securities. The Company has not experienced any\nrealized losses on its deposits of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities since inception.\nThe following tables summarize the Company’s financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level\nwithin the fair value hierarchy (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2024\nFair Value Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Market\nHierarchy Cost Basis Gains Losses Value\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 44,612 $ — $ — $ 44,612\nMarketable securities, available for sale:\nAsset-backed securities Level 2 49,099 109 — 49,208\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 191,068 408 (5) 191,471\nCommercial paper Level 2 17,212 16 — 17,228\nU.S. government treasury and agency securities Level 2 189,300 523 — 189,823\nTotal $ 491,291 $ 1,056 $ (5) $ 492,342\n13\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFair Value Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Market\nHierarchy Cost Basis Gains Losses Value\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 85,897 $ — $ — $ 85,897\nMarketable securities, available for sale:\nAsset-backed securities Level 2 10,228 12 (2) 10,238\nCorporate debt securities Level 2 82,514 66 (113) 82,467\nCommercial paper Level 2 19,457 13 (8) 19,462\nU.S. government treasury and agency securities Level 2 116,579 151 (26) 116,704\nSupranational and sovereign government securities Level 2 3,419 6 — 3,425\nTotal $ 318,094 $ 248 $ (149) $ 318,193\nThe Company’s money market funds are classified as Level 1 because they are valued using quoted market prices.\nInvestments in asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper and U.S. government treasury and agency\nsecurities, and supranational and sovereign government securities have been classified as Level 2 as they are valued using\nquoted prices in less active markets or other directly or indirectly observable inputs. Fair values of asset-backed securities,\ncorporate debt securities, commercial paper, U.S. government treasury and agency securities, and supranational and sovereign\ngovernment securities were derived based on input of market prices from multiple sources at each reporting period. With\nregard to commercial paper, all of the securities had high credit ratings and one year or less to maturity; therefore, fair value\nwas derived from accretion of purchase price to face value over the term of maturity or quoted market prices for similar\ninstruments if available. There were no transfers of financial assets between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3, during the periods\npresented. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining contractual maturities of $409.0 million of marketable securities were less\nthan one year and $37.7 million of marketable securities were between 1 and 2 years.\nThe Company periodically reviews its portfolio of debt securities to determine if any investment is impaired due to credit\nloss or other potential valuation concerns. For debt securities where the fair value of the investment is less than the amortized\ncost basis, the Company has assessed at the individual security level for various quantitative factors including, but not limited\nto, the nature of the investments, changes in credit ratings, interest rate fluctuations, industry analyst reports, and the severity\nof impairment. Unrealized losses on marketable securities at September 30, 2024 were primarily due to changes in interest\nrates, including market credit spreads, and not due to increased credit risks associated with specific securities.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other events and/or\ncircumstances from non-owner sources. The Company’s only element of other comprehensive income was net unrealized gain\non marketable securities.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes compensation\nexpense for all stock-based awards issued to employees based on the estimated grant-date fair value, which is recognized as\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they\noccur. For restricted stock unit awards, the fair value is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date\nof grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of fair\nvalue for stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model requires management to make certain\nassumptions including expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends in addition to the\nCompany’s common stock valuation.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accrued Research and Development Expenses\nExpenditures made for research and development are charged to expense as incurred. External costs consist primarily of\npayments to contract research organizations (CROs), contract development and manufacturing organizations\n14\nTable of Contents\n(CDMOs), sample acquisition costs and laboratory supplies purchased in connection with the Company’s discovery and\npreclinical activities, and process development and clinical development activities. Internal costs consist primarily of\nemployee-related costs, facilities, depreciation and costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements. Non-refundable\nadvance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are capitalized and\nrecorded as an expense in the period that the Company receives the goods or when services are performed.\nThe Company records expenses related to external research and development services based on its estimates of the\nservices received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CROs and CDMOs that supply, conduct\nand manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on its behalf. The financial terms of these contracts vary from contract to\ncontract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under\nsuch contracts. In accruing service fees, the Company estimates the time period over which services will be performed and the\nlevel of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies\nfrom the estimate, the Company adjusts the accrual or the amount of prepaid expenses accordingly.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS\nAct). Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying\nwith new or revised accounting standards, delaying the adoption of these accounting standards until they would apply to\nprivate companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period for complying with certain new or revised\naccounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that it is\n(1) no longer an emerging growth company or (2) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period\nprovided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the\nnew or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures to update reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant\nsegment expenses and information used to assess segment performance. This update is effective beginning with the\nCompany’s 2024 fiscal year annual reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the\nimpact that the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.\nThis ASU is expected to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring public\nbusiness entities on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, additional information for\nreconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, and certain information about income taxes paid. This ASU is effective\nbeginning with the Company’s 2025 fiscal year annual reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its financial statements.\nNOTE 3 PREFERRED STOCK AND COMMON STOCK\nThe Company is authorized to issue two classes of stock designated as common stock and preferred stock. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the total number of shares authorized was 1,200,000,000. The total number of shares of common stock\nauthorized was 1,000,000,000. The total number of shares of preferred stock authorized was 200,000,000. All shares of the\nCompany’s capital stock have a par value of $0.0001 per share.\nCommon stockholders are entitled to dividends if and when declared by the board of directors of the Company and after\nany convertible preferred share dividends are fully paid. The holder of each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.\n15\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn March 2021, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the Company’s 2021 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the 2021 Plan), which became effective in March 2021 in connection with the IPO. Upon adoption of the 2021\nPlan, the Company restricted the grant of future equity awards under its 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated\n(the 2017 Plan).\nThe 2021 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, to the Company’s employees and any of its parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees, and for the grant of\nnonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units, and\nperformance shares to its employees, directors, and consultants and its subsidiary corporations’ employees and consultants.\nThe vesting of stock options is stated in each individual grant agreement, which is generally four years. Options granted\nexpire 10 years after the date of grant. A total of 5,040,000 shares of the Company’s common stock were initially reserved for\nissuance pursuant to the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan share reserve increases by the number of shares under the 2017 Plan that\nare repurchased, forfeited, expired or cancelled after the effective date of the 2021 Plan up to the limit under the 2021 Plan.\nThe number of shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan increases annually on the first day of each fiscal year\nbeginning with the Company’s 2022 fiscal year, equal to the least of (1) 5,040,000 shares, (2) five percent (5%) of the\noutstanding shares of its common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or (3) such other amount as\nthe Company’s board of directors may determine. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,506,606 shares available for future\nissuance under the 2021 Plan.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued 2,751,497 stock options with a fair value of\n$34.5 million that vest over a weighted average period of 3.9 years and 557,027 restricted stock units (RSUs) with a fair value\nof $9.5 million that vest over a weighted average period of 4 years.\nInducement Equity Incentive Plan\nEffective August 10, 2024, the Company’s board of directors adopted the Company’s 2024 Inducement Equity Incentive\nPlan (the Inducement Plan) and, subject to the adjustment provisions of the Inducement Plan, reserved 2,000,000 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock for issuance pursuant to equity awards granted under the Inducement Plan.\nThe Inducement Plan was adopted without stockholder approval pursuant to the applicable The Nasdaq Stock Market\nLLC’s (Nasdaq) Listing Rules. The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including nonstatutory\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance awards, and its terms are\nsubstantially similar to the 2021 Plan, including with respect to treatment of equity awards in the event of a “merger” or\n“change in control” as defined under the Inducement Plan, but with such other terms and conditions intended to comply with\nthe Nasdaq inducement award exception or to comply with the Nasdaq acquisition and merger exception.\nIn accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals not\npreviously employees or non-employee directors of the Company (or following such individuals’ bona fide period of non-\nemployment with the Company), as an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company, or,\nto the extent permitted by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, in connection with a merger or acquisition. As of September 30, 2024,\nthere were 2,000,000 shares available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan.\nFounder Stock Options\nOn September 19, 2017, the Company granted one of its founders the option to purchase 1,795,880 shares of the\nCompany’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.18 per share which vest monthly over a four-year period that expires\n15 years after the date of grant. This grant is separate from the Company’s equity incentive plans discussed above. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, 1,456,780 options were both outstanding and exercisable. 75,000 options were exercised during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n16\nTable of Contents\nTotal stock-based compensation expense related to all equity plans, including Founder Stock Options was allocated as\nfollows (in thousands):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nResearch and development $ 3,884 $ 2,639 $ 9,508 $ 7,028\nGeneral and administrative 2,996 1,920 7,467 5,379\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 6,880 $ 4,559 $ 16,975 $ 12,407\nNOTE 5 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are\nrecorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. From time to time,\nthe Company may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company was not\nsubject to any material legal proceedings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and no material legal\nproceedings are currently pending or threatened.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors,\nlessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising of breach\nof such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has\nentered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors that will require the Company, among other\nthings, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification\nagreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such\nindemnifications. The Company is not aware of any claims under indemnification arrangements, and it has not accrued any\nliabilities related to such obligations in its financial statements as of September 30, 2024.\nNOTE 6 NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares\noutstanding during the period, without consideration of potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed\nby dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and potentially dilutive securities outstanding for\nthe period. For purposes of the diluted net loss per share calculation, common stock options and unvested restricted stock units\nare considered to be potentially dilutive securities. The Company’s participating securities do not have a contractual obligation\nto share in the Company’s losses. As such, the net loss was attributed entirely to common stockholders. As the Company has\nreported a net loss for all periods presented, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common share\nfor those periods.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth the computation of the basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except share and\nper share data):\nThree months ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator\nNet loss $ (34,129) $ (25,713)$ (94,151) $ (70,020)\nDenominator\nWeighted-average shares outstanding used\nin computing net loss per share, basic and\ndiluted 93,813,346 63,459,560 91,639,964 63,369,358\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted $ (0.36) $ (0.41)$ (1.03) $ (1.10)\nThe following weighted average outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation\nof diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods presented because including them would have\nbeen anti-dilutive:\nThree months ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOptions to purchase common stock 16,891,674 14,188,382 16,123,873 12,951,452\nUnvested restricted stock units 386,465 177,871 224,615 217,657\nTotal 17,278,139 14,366,253 16,348,488 13,169,109\nNOTE 7 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nLeasehold improvements $ 9,546 $ 8,728\nLaboratory equipment 3,735 3,473\nComputers and software 296 281\nFurniture and fixtures 497 497\nConstruction in process — 80\nProperty and equipment, at cost 14,074 13,059\nLess: accumulated depreciation (4,108) (2,616)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 9,966 $ 10,443\nDepreciation expense was $0.5 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n$0.4 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 8 ACCRUED OTHER EXPENSES\nAccrued other expenses consisted of the following amounts (in thousands):\nAs of September 30, As of December 31,\n2024 2023\nAccrued research and development costs $ 5,365 $ 5,672\nAccrued other 766 399\nTotal accrued other expenses $ 6,131 $ 6,071\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of Edgewise Therapeutics, Inc. should\nbe read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report), and the audited financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK (Annual Report), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on February 22, 2024. In addition to historical\ninformation, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this Quarterly\nReport, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nYou should carefully read the “Risk Factors” to gain an understanding of the factors that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from our forward-looking statements. Please also see the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.”\nOverview\nSince our inception in 2017, we have been drawing on our deep expertise in muscle physiology and small molecule drug\ndiscovery to drive the next generation of first-in-class therapeutics to address a variety of severe muscle diseases. We are\nadvancing two clinical-stage programs in muscular dystrophies and severe cardiac diseases. Sevasemten (EDG-5506) is an\norally administered skeletal myosin inhibitor in a pivotal stage trial for Becker muscular dystrophy (Becker) as well as\nongoing Phase 2 programs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. EDG-7500, currently in a multipart Phase 2 trial, is a novel\ncardiac sarcomere modulator for the treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and other disorders of diastolic\ndysfunction. We also continue to advance our preclinical pipeline, including characterization of novel cardiometabolic targets.\nFrom this foundation and our dedication to muscle physiology and function, we will build a leading global biopharmaceutical\ncompany driving advances to improve the lives of people suffering from muscle diseases.\nAs a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, we are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of\ninnovative treatments for severe muscle diseases for which there is significant unmet medical need. Guided by our holistic\ndrug discovery approach to targeting the muscle as an organ, we have combined our foundational expertise in muscle biology\nand small molecule engineering to build our proprietary, muscle focused drug discovery platform. Our platform utilizes\ncustom-built high throughput and translatable systems that measure integrated muscle function in whole organ extracts to\nidentify small molecule precision medicines regulating key proteins in muscle tissue, initially focused on addressing rare\nneuromuscular and cardiac diseases. We have developed and characterized a library of novel sarcomere modulators exhibiting\na broad range of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties regulating disease-related muscle biology.\nWe have incurred significant losses since the commencement of our operations. Our net losses were $34.1 million and\n$94.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and $25.7 million and $70.0 million for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and we expect to continue to incur significant losses for\nthe foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through preclinical development and\n19\nTable of Contents\nclinical trials and seek regulatory approval of our product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to\nperiod, depending on the timing of and expenditures on our planned research and development activities.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.9 million. To date, we have financed our operations\nprimarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock and public offerings of our common stock. From inception\nthrough September 30, 2024, these private placements have provided gross proceeds of $160.7 million, and the initial public\noffering, follow-on public offering, issuance of our common stock under an “at the market offering” program (the ATM\nProgram), and underwritten registered direct offering have generated net proceeds of $606.6 million. We believe that our\nexisting cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $492.5 million will enable us to fund our planned operating\nexpenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nMacroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments\nWe are monitoring macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, such as inflation, instability in the banking and\nfinancial services sector, tightening of the credit markets, the upcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration,\ninternational conflicts, public health pandemics, cybersecurity and sanctions so that the Company can be prepared to react to\nnew developments as they arise.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred in connection with the discovery and\ndevelopment of our product candidates. We record research and development expenses when these are incurred. Such\nexpenses include:\n● employee and external consultant-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based\ncompensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n● external expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates including under\nagreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations (CROs);\n● the cost of external manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and ongoing and planned clinical\ntrials including under agreements with third parties such as consultants and contract development and manufacturing\norganizations (CDMOs);\n● expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates including external, or\noutsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research fees and payments made under\nsponsored research arrangements with third parties;\n● laboratory supplies;\n● facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of\nfacilities;\n● expenses related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and\n● payments made under third-party licensing agreements.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe majority of these expenses have been incurred to advance our lead product candidate, sevasemten and to a lesser\ndegree EDG-7500. We expect that significant additional spending will be required to progress these and other potential\ndiscoveries through the remainder of the clinical development phases. These expenses will primarily consist of expenses for\nthe administration of clinical trials as well as manufacturing costs for clinical material supply.\nWe track our direct research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis once a lead compound has been\nselected and clinical trials have been initiated. These direct costs consist primarily of external costs such as fees paid to\noutside consultants, CROs, CDMOs, clinical trial sites and central laboratories in connection with our discovery and\npreclinical activities, process development, manufacturing and clinical development activities. These expenses are recognized\nbased on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our service\nproviders or our estimate of the level of service that has been performed at each reporting date. Our direct research and\ndevelopment expenses by program also include costs of laboratory supplies that can be directly attributed to a specific\nprogram as well as any fees incurred under license agreements. We do not allocate employee-related costs, including stock-\nbased compensation, or facility expenses, including rent, depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific programs because\nthese costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources\nprimarily to conduct our research and discovery activities and to manage our preclinical development, manufacturing and\nclinical development activities.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier\nstages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We are currently conducting four Phase 2\nclinical trials with sevasemten for people with muscular dystrophy (CANYON, LYNX, FOX and DUNE), a potentially\nregistrational, or pivotal cohort, in individuals with Becker (GRAND CANYON), and a multipart Phase 2 study with EDG-\n7500 for people with HCM (CIRRUS-HCM). As a result, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase\nsubstantially over the next several years as we advance sevasemten, EDG-7500, a product from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic\ndiscovery program through clinical trials and additional product candidates; continue to develop our proprietary drug\ndiscovery platform; continue to discover and develop additional product candidates; and hire additional personnel.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain, and we do not believe it is possible at this time\nto accurately project the nature, timing and extent of expenses necessary to complete the development of our product\ncandidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue from our product candidates to offset these\nexpenses. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous\nuncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies and clinical trials and\ndevelopment of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n● the timing and progress of preclinical and clinical development activities;\n● the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;\n● our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;\n● establishing an appropriate safety profile with IND-enabling studies;\n● successful patient enrollment in, and the initiation and completion of, clinical trials;\n● the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the\nFDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;\n● the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;\n● the performance of our future collaborators, if any;\n21\nTable of Contents\n● establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n● development and timely delivery of sufficient supplies of our drug product that can be used in our planned clinical\ntrials and for commercial launch upon approval;\n● obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n● launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\nand\n● maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the product candidates following approval.\nAny changes in the outcome of any of these factors could significantly impact the costs and timing\nassociated with the development of our product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense\nfor personnel in executive, finance, accounting, legal and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also\ninclude facilities and other expenses, which include direct or allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and\ninsurance, not otherwise included in research and development expenses, as well as professional fees for legal, patent,\nconsulting, investor and public relations, accounting and audit services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to\nsupport the continued research and development of our programs.\nInterest income\nInterest income primarily consists of interest income generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 32,222 $ 23,786 $ 8,436\nGeneral and administrative 8,210 5,666 2,544\nTotal operating expenses 40,432 29,452 10,980\nLoss from operations\nInterest income 6,303 3,739 2,564\nNet loss $ 34,129 $ 25,713 $ 8,416\n22\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses:\nThree months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands)\nExternal research and development expenses:\nSevasemten clinical program $ 13,119 $ 8,538 $ 4,581\nEDG-7500 clinical program 4,118 3,979 139\nDiscovery and preclinical 3,040 2,450 590\nInternal costs, including personnel related 11,945 8,819 3,126\nTotal research and development expenses $ 32,222 $ 23,786 $ 8,436\nResearch and development expenses were $32.2 million and $23.8 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $8.4 million was driven by an increase of $4.6 million in\nsevasemten clinical program expenses, which was primarily due to increased clinical trial activity from site activations, patient\nenrollment, and manufacturing costs in our GRAND CANYON and FOX trials that were in start-up phases during the\ncomparable period in 2023 and general clinical and outreach costs incurred in connection with all sevasemten trials. Internal\ncosts increased $3.1 million, primarily related to personnel costs and stock-based compensation resulting from increased\nemployee headcount to support the growth of our research and development programs. Discovery and preclinical expenses\nincreased $0.6 million as a result of additional manufacturing and nonclinical costs related to our EDG-003 program and other\ncardio-metabolic research. EDG-7500 clinical program expenses increased $0.1 million primarily related to the start-up, site\nactivation, and patient enrollment for our multipart Phase 2 CIRRUS-HCM trial; our Phase 1 trial was in a similar start-up\nphase in the comparable period in 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $8.2 million and $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The increase of $2.5 million was primarily due to $1.6 million in increased personnel-related costs\nfrom increased headcount and stock-based compensation and $0.9 million in increased professional and consulting costs and\nother administrative costs.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $6.3 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe increase of $2.6 million was primarily due to higher balances of marketable securities during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nComparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 90,596 $ 63,221 $ 27,375\nGeneral and administrative 22,696 17,274 5,422\nTotal operating expenses 113,292 80,495 32,797\nLoss from operations\nInterest income 19,141 10,475 8,666\nNet loss $ 94,151 $ 70,020 $ 24,131\n23\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses:\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands)\nExternal research and development expenses:\nSevasemten clinical program $ 37,886 $ 23,231 $ 14,655\nEDG-7500 clinical program 13,208 3,979 9,229\nDiscovery and preclinical 7,120 11,885 (4,765)\nInternal costs, including personnel related 32,382 24,126 8,256\nTotal research and development expenses $ 90,596 $ 63,221 $ 27,375\nResearch and development expenses were $90.6 million and $63.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The increase of $27.4 million was primarily driven by an increase of $14.7 million in sevasemten\nclinical program expenses which was primarily due an $8.6 million increase in our GRAND CANYON trial, $3.5 million\nincrease in our FOX trial, $2.4 million increase in our LYNX trial, and $2.0 million increase in our MESA trial related to site\nactivation and patient enrollment as the trials were in startup phases in the third quarter of 2023; offset by a $1.3 million\ndecrease in our CANYON trial, which is nearing completion. EDG-7500 clinical program expenses increased $9.2 million\nrelated to the completion of our Phase 1 trial that was activated in late 2023 and manufacturing, site activation, and patient\nenrollment costs related to our CIRRUS-HCM trial that began in 2024. Internal costs increased $8.3 million, primarily related\nto a $5.0 million increase in personnel costs related to salaries, benefits, and employee expenses resulting from increased\nemployee headcount to support the growth of our research and development programs, a $2.5 million increase in stock-based\ncompensation related to increased headcount and overall higher stock prices driving increased option fair values, and $0.8\nmillion related to depreciation and other facilities costs. Discovery and preclinical expenses decreased $4.8 million as a result\nof EDG-7500 costs, now shown separately, which were a significant portion of the first nine months of 2023’s discovery and\npreclinical expenses along with other costs from our EDG-003 program.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $22.7 million and $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The increase of $5.4 million was primarily due to $3.8 million in increased personnel-related costs\nfrom increased headcount and stock-based compensation and $1.6 million in increased professional and consulting costs and\nother administrative costs.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $19.1 million and $10.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. The increase of $8.7 million was primarily due to higher balances of marketable securities during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of liquidity\nSince our inception, we have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash\nflows from our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible\npreferred stock and public offerings of our common stock. From inception through September 30, 2024, these private\nplacements have provided gross proceeds of $160.7 million, and the initial public offering, follow-on public offering, issuance\nof our common stock under the ATM Program, and underwritten registered direct offering have generated net proceeds of\n$606.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the amount of $492.5\nmillion.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nNine months ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (82,071) $ (65,118)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities (205,578) 75,903\nNet cash provided by financing activities 246,358 179\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (41,291) $ 10,964\nOperating activities\nCash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by our net loss\nfor the period of $94.2 million, and was also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which decreased net\nworking capital by $3.4 million. Cash used in operating activities was reduced by non-cash charges of $8.7 million relating to\nstock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million, amortization of premium and accretion of discounts, net on marketable\nsecurities of $9.9 million, depreciation of $1.5 million and amortization of right-of-use asset of $0.2 million.\nCash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by our net loss\nfor the period of $70.0 million, and was also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities which increased net\nworking capital by $1.4 million. Cash used in operating activities was reduced by non-cash charges of $6.3 million relating to\nstock-based compensation expense of $12.4 million, amortization of premium and accretion of discounts, net on marketable\nsecurities of $7.3 million, depreciation of $1.1 million and amortization of right-of-use asset of $0.1 million.\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to $205.6 million, which\nwas due to $413.9 million in purchases of marketable securities and $1.0 million for purchases of equipment, which was\npartially offset by $196.6 million in maturities of marketable securities and $12.7 million in sales of marketable securities.\nCash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 amounted to $75.9 million,\nwhich was due to $278.4 million in maturities of marketable securities and $19.2 million in sales of marketable securities,\nwhich was partially offset by $216.1 million in purchases of marketable securities and $5.6 million for purchases of\nequipment.\nFinancing activities\nCash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $246.4 million, which was\ndue to cash proceeds of $7.0 million from the ATM Program, $240.0 million from the underwritten registered direct offering,\n$7.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options, and $0.4 million in proceeds from\nthe employee stock purchase plan, which was partially offset by $7.9 million for the payment of underwriting commissions\nand offering costs and $0.3 million for the payment of deferred offering costs.\nCash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $0.2 million, which was due\nto cash proceeds of $0.3 million in proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan and cash proceeds of 0.1 million from the\nissuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $0.2 million for the payment of\ndeferred offering costs.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFunding requirements\nWe will continue to require substantial additional capital to develop our product candidates and fund operations for the\nforeseeable future. On May 10, 2024, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR that allows us to\nundertake various equity and debt offerings and entered into the Leerink Sales Agreement under which we may offer and sell\nshares of common stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $175,000,000 from time to time, through the Leerink ATM.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the development of\nand seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and begin to commercialize any approved products. We are subject\nto all of the risks incident in the development of new products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties,\ncomplications, delays and other unknown factors that may harm our business. In addition, we expect to continue to incur\nadditional costs associated with operating as a public company. Our expenses will also increase if, and as, we:\n● advance our product candidates through preclinical and clinical development;\n● seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n● continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery platform;\n● seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n● establish a sales, marketing, medical affairs and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates\nfor which we may obtain marketing approval and intend to commercialize on our own or jointly;\n● hire additional clinical, quality control, scientific and other personnel;\n● expand our operational, financial and management systems and increase personnel including personnel to support\nour clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts and our operations as a public company;\n● maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; and\n● acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nWe do not currently have any long-term material capital requirements other than what will be required to fund operations\nfor the foreseeable future and the amounts disclosed on the contractual obligations and commitments section below. In order\nto complete the process of obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates and to build the sales, marketing and\ndistribution infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, we will\nrequire substantial additional funding.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we\nmay use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties\nassociated with research, development and commercialization of product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact\namount and timing of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors,\nincluding:\n● the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates including:\no conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\no the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\no the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we pursue;\n26\nTable of Contents\no the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and\ndistribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\no the costs of manufacturing products of consistent quality and obtaining sufficient inventory to support\ncommercial launch;\no the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates\nreceive marketing approval;\no the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property\nrights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n● the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products;\n● the ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n● the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n● the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or future\nproduct candidates, if any;\n● our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;\n● the compliance and administrative costs associated with being a public company;\n● the effects of inflation on our business operations; and\n● the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies, although we currently have no\ncommitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product candidates\ncould significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. Furthermore, our\noperating plans may change in the future, and we may need additional funds to meet operational needs and capital\nrequirements associated with such operating plans.\nIf we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product\ndevelopment or future commercialization efforts. We may also be required to grant rights to develop and market product\ncandidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities may cause our stockholders to experience dilution. Future equity or debt\nfinancings may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders including debt instruments imposing covenants\nthat restrict our operations and limit our ability to incur liens, issue additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common\nstock, make certain investments or engage in merger, consolidation, licensing or asset sale transactions.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nWe expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our\nplanned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months.\nOur short-term material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024 are to fund our operations, which consist primarily\nof research and development expenses related to our programs, and to a lesser extent, general and\n27\nTable of Contents\nadministrative expenses. We have entered into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, CDMOs and other third\nparties for preclinical research studies and testing, clinical trials and manufacturing services. These contracts do not contain\nany minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable by us upon prior notice. Payments due upon cancellation consist only\nof payments for services provided and expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to\nthe date of cancellation.\nOur long-term cash requirements as of September 30, 2024 includes our lease obligations. In January 2022, we entered\ninto a lease agreement for approximately 18,614 square feet of office and laboratory space in Boulder, Colorado which\nincludes escalating rent payments and an 8.2 year term, plus our share of operating expenses. In February 2023, the lease was\nmodified to occupy an additional 9,624 square feet of office space, with aggregate payments of approximately $1.5 million\nover the initial 7.3 year term, plus our share of operating expenses. As of September 30, 2024 our total operating lease liability\nbalance is $4.4 million, of which $1.0 million is a current liability.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nThe preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our\nfinancial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that\nwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and\nassumptions on a periodic basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are described in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC\non February 22, 2024 and the notes to the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting\nestimates from those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2024.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results\nof operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing in our Quarterly Report.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nSection 107 of The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act) permits an “emerging growth company”\nsuch as us to take advantage of an extended transition time to comply with new or revised accounting standards as applicable\nto public companies. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those\nstandards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period\nand, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards\nis required for private companies.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2024.\nWe are also currently a “smaller reporting company,” and based on the market value of our common stock held by non-\naffiliates exceeding $700.0 million as of June 30, 2024, we will transition to a “large accelerated filer” status with effect as of\nJanuary 1, 2025.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b‑2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the\ninformation required under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, or the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under\nthe Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and\nExchange Commission’s rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosure. We\nbelieve that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives\nof the control system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act)\nthat occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our\noperations. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with\ncertainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, which could materially affect our\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described\nbelow, as well as the other information in this Quarterly Report and in our other public filings in evaluating our\nbusiness. The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could harm our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could\ndecline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or\nthat we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and the market price of our common stock.\nRisk Factors Summary\nInvesting in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks\nand uncertainties, as fully described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in shares of our\ncommon stock risky include, among others:\n● We have a limited operating history, some of our product candidates are early in development and we have no\nproducts approved for commercial sale.\n● We have not generated any revenue to date, have incurred significant net losses since our inception, and expect\nto continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future.\n29\nTable of Contents\n● Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our ability to achieve several\nobjectives relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved.\n● We will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital\nwhen needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our\nresearch and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts.\n● Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish\nrights to our technologies or product candidates.\n● We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, sevasemten (EDG-5506).\n● In addition to sevasemten, our prospects depend in part upon developing and commercializing EDG-7500 and\nproduct candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and discovering, developing and\ncommercializing product candidates in future programs, which may fail or suffer delays that adversely affect\ntheir commercial viability.\n● Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. The clinical\ntrials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA,\nEuropean Medicines Agency (EMA) or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise produce\npositive results and the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of future\nresults.\n● Our product candidates may cause serious adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used\nalone or in combination with other approved products or investigational new drugs.\n● The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials,\nand the results of our clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities.\n● If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our\nregulatory submissions or receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n● We have limited resources and are currently focusing the majority of our efforts on developing sevasemten and\nEDG-7500 for particular indications. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on other indications or product\ncandidates that may ultimately have proven to be more profitable.\n● We face significant competition and if our competitors develop and market technologies or products more\nrapidly than we do or that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the products we develop, our\ncommercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\n● Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change as more patient data\nbecomes available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n● We may not be successful in our efforts to develop a proprietary drug discovery platform to build a pipeline of\nproduct candidates.\n● We may develop sevasemten and potentially other programs in combination with other therapies, which would\nexpose us to additional risks.\n● The manufacture of drugs is complex, and our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production.\n● Changes in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\n● Our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors\nand others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\n30\nTable of Contents\n● The patient population suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne), Becker muscular dystrophy\n(Becker) and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is small and has not been established with precision.\n● The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are\nlengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable.\n● Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers and employees.\n● Our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\n● We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may\nnot perform satisfactorily.\n● We contract with third parties for the production of our product candidates.\n● Our reliance on third parties may require us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a\ncompetitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\n● If we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute\nour stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\n● Our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by public health pandemics, such as COVID-\n19 and other related outbreaks in the United States and the rest of the world.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position, Need for Additional Capital and Limited Operating History\nWe have a limited operating history, some of our product candidates are early in development and we have no products approved\nfor commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and likelihood of success and future\nviability.\nWe are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate\nour business and prospects. We are developing precision medicines for rare neuromuscular diseases which is an\nunproven and highly uncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. We commenced operations in 2017,\nhave no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue. In July 2022, we initiated the first\nof four Phase 2 clinical trials for our lead product candidate, sevasemten, and we are enrolling Part B and Part C of a\nmultipart Phase 2 clinical trial with our product candidate EDG-7500 for people with HCM. We have not yet initiated\nclinical trials for any other product candidate, including product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic\ndiscovery program. Since our inception in 2017, we have devoted substantially all of our focus and financial resources\nto discovering, identifying and developing potential product candidates, including advancing our development\nprograms, conducting preclinical studies of our product candidates and initiating clinical trials, organizing and staffing\nour company, business planning, raising capital and securing related intellectual property rights.\nWe have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or\narrange for a third-party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful\nproduct commercialization. As a result, it may be more difficult for investors to accurately predict our likelihood of\nsuccess and viability than it could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and\nunknown factors and risks frequently experienced by clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies in rapidly evolving\nfields. We also may need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of\nsupporting commercial activities. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome such risks and\ndifficulties, or to make such a transition. If we do not adequately address these risks and difficulties or successfully\nmake such a transition, our business will suffer.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe have not generated any revenue to date, have incurred significant net losses since our inception, and expect to continue to\nincur significant net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception, have not generated any revenue to date and have\nfinanced our operations principally through private placements of our convertible preferred stock and public offerings of\nour common stock. Our net loss was $34.1 million and $94.2 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.9 million. We are\nadvancing sevasemten and EDG-7500 in clinical development. Our other programs, including EDG-003, are in\npreclinical discovery and research stages. As a result, we expect that it will be several years, if ever, before we receive\napproval to commercialize a product and generate revenue from product sales. Even if we succeed in receiving\nmarketing approval for and commercializing one or more of our approved product candidates, we expect that we will\ncontinue to incur substantial research and development and other expenses in order to discover, develop and market\nadditional potential products.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The\nnet losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter such that a period-to-period comparison of our\nresults of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance, particularly since we expect our expenses\nto increase if and when our product candidates progress through clinical development as product candidates in later\nstages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the\nincreased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate\nof future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have\nhad and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, our ability to fund the development of our\nproduct candidates and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and the performance of our stock.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our ability to achieve several objectives relating\nto the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved.\nOur business depends entirely on the successful discovery, development, regulatory approval and commercialization\nof product candidates. We have no products approved for commercial sale and do not anticipate generating any revenue\nfrom product sales for the next several years, if ever. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends\nsignificantly on our ability, or any future collaborator’s ability, to achieve several objectives, including:\n● successful and timely completion of preclinical and clinical development of sevasemten, EDG-7500, and\nproduct candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and our other future product\ncandidates and programs;\n● establishing and maintaining relationships with CROs and clinical sites for the clinical development of\nsevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and any\nother future product candidates and programs;\n● the initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials on a timely basis;\n● acceptable frequency and severity of adverse events in the clinical trials;\n● the efficacy and safety profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority\nfor marketing approval;\n● timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates for\nwhich we successfully complete clinical development;\n32\nTable of Contents\n● complying with any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n● developing an efficient and scalable manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n● establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties\nthat can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support clinical development\nand meet the market demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n● successful commercial launch following any marketing approval, including the development of a commercial\ninfrastructure, whether in-house or with one or more collaborators;\n● a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval of our product candidates;\n● commercial acceptance of our product candidates by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n● timely receipt of reimbursement from applicable authorities for any product candidates for which we\nsuccessfully receive regulatory approval;\n● satisfying any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n● identifying, assessing and developing new product candidates;\n● obtaining, maintaining and expanding patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both\nin the United States and internationally;\n● protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n● defending against third-party infringement claims, if any;\n● entering into, on favorable terms, any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or\ndesirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates;\n● obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors for our products and patients’\nwillingness to pay in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n● obtaining additional funding to develop and potentially manufacture and commercialize our product candidates;\n● addressing any competing therapies and technological and market developments;\n● managing costs, including any unforeseen costs, that we may incur as a result of nonclinical study or clinical\ntrial delays due to COVID-19 or other public health outbreaks or emergencies, inflation or other causes; and\n● attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel, including clinical, scientific, management and\nadministrative personnel.\nWe may never be successful in achieving our objectives and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is\nsignificant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or\nincrease profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease\n33\nTable of Contents\nthe value of our company and could impair our ability to maintain or further our research and development efforts, raise\nadditional necessary capital, grow our business and continue our operations.\nWe may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and scalable manufacturing process or\ntransferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or\ncommercializing our product candidates on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. Changes in the manufacturing process\nor facilities will require further comparability analysis and approval by the FDA before implementation, which could\ndelay our clinical trials and product candidate development, and could require additional clinical trials, including\nbridging studies, to demonstrate consistent and continued safety and efficacy.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on\nacceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development\nprograms or future commercialization efforts.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $492.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We expect\nour current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our current operating plan for at\nleast the next 12 months. On May 10, 2024, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR that\nallows us to undertake various equity and debt offerings. We additionally filed a prospectus supplement to the shelf\nregistration statement and entered into a sales agreement with Leerink Partners LLC (Leerink Sales Agreement) on May\n10, 2024, under which we may offer and sell shares of common stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to\n$175,000,000 from time to time, through an “at the market offering” program (Leerink ATM). We have not yet offered\nor sold any shares of common stock related to the Leerink ATM. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions\nthat may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing\ncircumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we\ncurrently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-\nconsuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. Our operations have consumed substantial\namounts of cash since inception, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities,\nparticularly as we conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates\nfrom our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program, as well as develop our proprietary drug discovery platform.\nEven if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring\nsignificant costs associated with sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities. Our expenses could increase\nbeyond expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or\npreclinical studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. Because\nthe design and outcome of our planned and anticipated preclinical studies and clinical trials are highly uncertain, we\ncannot reasonably estimate the actual amount of resources and funding that will be necessary to successfully complete\nthe development and commercialization of any product candidate we develop. We are not permitted to market or\npromote sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program or any other\nproduct candidate before we receive marketing approval from the FDA. We also expect to incur costs associated with\noperating as a public company. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be sufficient for us to fund\nany of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to complete the\ndevelopment and commercialization of our products. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding\nin order to continue our operations.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on may factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates including\nconducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n● the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n34\nTable of Contents\n● the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we pursue;\n● the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and\ndistribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n● the costs of manufacturing products of consistent quality and obtaining sufficient inventory to support\ncommercial launch;\n● the revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of our products, should any of our product candidates\nreceive marketing approval;\n● the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n● the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual\nproperty rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n● the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our products;\n● the ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n● the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n● the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or milestone payments related to or royalties on, our current or\nfuture product candidates, if any;\n● our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems;\n● the compliance and administrative costs associated with being a public company; and\n● the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies, although we currently have no\ncommitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nA change in the outcome of any of these or other factors with respect to the development of any of our product\ncandidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate.\nWe may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we\nhave sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. In the event that we would need to obtain additional\nfunding, our ability to raise or access capital may be affected by macroeconomic events and disruptions to the U.S. banking\nand financial sectors. Failures of banks and other financial institutions, such as Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, or issues\nin the broader U.S. financial system may impact the broader capital markets, and in turn, may impact our ability to access\nthose markets. Further, a tightening of credit markets and lending standards could it make more difficult for us to raise capital\nthrough either debt or equity offerings on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAttempting to secure additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may\nadversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed or on acceptable terms would have a negative impact on our\nfinancial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy, and we may have to delay, reduce the scope of,\nsuspend or eliminate one or more of our research-stage programs, clinical trials or future commercialization efforts.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our\ntechnologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we will be required to obtain further funding\nthrough public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources,\nwhich may dilute our stockholders or restrict our operating activities. As summarized in the risk factor entitled, “We will\nrequire substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or\non acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug\ndevelopment programs or future commercialization efforts.”, we have previously raised capital under our shelf\nregistration statement that was filed on April 1, 2022 with the SEC that became effective on May 5, 2022 and was\namended on January 19, 2024. On May 10, 2024, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR\nthat allows us to undertake various equity and debt offerings and entered into the Leerink Sales Agreement under which\nwe may offer and sell shares of common stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $175,000,000 from time to\ntime, through the Leerink ATM.\nAdequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise\nadditional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and\nthe terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing\nand preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our\nability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, engaging in acquisition, merger or\ncollaboration transactions, selling or licensing our assets, making capital expenditures, redeeming our stock, making\ncertain investments, declaring dividends or encumbering our assets to secure future indebtedness. Such restrictions\ncould adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business plan.\nIf we raise additional funds through upfront payments or milestone payments pursuant to strategic collaborations,\nstrategic alliances or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish\nvaluable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on\nterms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when\nneeded, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization\nefforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market\nourselves.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be\nlimited.\nOur net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards may be unavailable to offset future taxable income because of\nrestrictions under U.S. tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are only\npermitted to be carried forward for 20 taxable years under applicable U.S. federal tax law, and therefore could expire\nunused. Under tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) as amended by the\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, our federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after\nDecember 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, the\ndeductibility of federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of our current\nyear taxable income. Our state NOLs may be subject to similar or different limitations. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad available federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $109.4 million, of which $108.2 million do not expire, and\nstate NOL carryforwards of approximately $114.3 million, of which $32.8 million do not expire.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation\nundergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a cumulative change in the corporation’s ownership by “5-\npercent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use\nits pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited.\nSimilar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may\nexperience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock\n36\nTable of Contents\nownership, some of which are outside our control. We have not conducted any studies to determine annual limitations, if\nany, that could result from such changes in the ownership of our stock. Our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other\ntax attributes could be limited by an “ownership change” as described above and consequently, we may not be able to\nutilize a material portion of our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on our\ncash flows and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial\nconditions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, and policies of several taxing jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, as well as other\nfactors, could cause us to experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rates and otherwise adversely affect\nour tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. For example, in August 2022, the United States enacted the Inflation Reduction Act\nof 2022, which imposes a 1% non-deductible excise tax on certain stock buybacks and a 15% alternative minimum tax on\nglobal adjusted financial statement income. In addition, beginning in 2022, the Tax Act eliminated the option to deduct\nresearch and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen\nyears, and this requirement may impact our effective tax rate and our cash tax liability in future years. When and if we achieve\nprofitability, these changes may cause us to pay federal income taxes earlier than under prior law and may increase our total\nfederal tax liability attributable to orphan drug programs and other research and development activities. Further, many\ncountries, and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have proposed\nimplementing changes to existing tax laws, including a proposed 15% global minimum tax that has been and is being adopted\nby several countries, with implementation beginning in 2024. Any of these developments or changes in U.S. federal, state, or\ninternational tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. There can be no\nassurance that our effective tax rates, tax payments, or tax credits and incentives will not be adversely affected by these or\nother developments or changes in law.\nMarket conditions and changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could impair our ability to\naccess our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and to timely pay key vendors and others.\nMarket conditions and changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could impair our ability\nto access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and to timely pay key vendors and others. For example, on\nMarch 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), where we maintain certain operating accounts, was placed into\nreceivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which resulted in all funds held at SVB being\ntemporarily inaccessible by SVB’s customers. If other banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking\nrelationships enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some\nor all of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise\nprotected by the FDIC. In addition, in such circumstances we might not be able to timely pay key vendors and others.\nWe regularly maintain cash balances that are not insured or are in excess of the FDIC’s insurance limit. Any delay in our\nability to access our cash, cash equivalents and investments (or the loss of some or all of such funds) or to timely pay\nkey vendors and others could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cause us to need to seek additional\ncapital sooner than planned.\nOur operations and financial results could be adversely impacted by public health pandemics, such as COVID-19 and other\nrelated outbreaks in the United States and the rest of the world.\nDisruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our productivity, resulted in increased operational\nexpenses, certain adjustments to the operations of our clinical trial, delays in the enrollment of new patients at our\nclinical trial site, and delays in certain supply chain activities and collecting and analyzing data from patients in our\nclinical trial.\nTo the extent we may experience any disruptions directly or indirectly through our contractors or partners as a result of\nany ongoing pandemic, outbreaks or other public health emergencies or disruptions, including any resurgence in COVID-19\ncases in the future, that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n37\nTable of Contents\n● further delays or difficulties in enrolling and retaining patients in our clinical trials or those conducted by third\nparties and further incurrence of additional costs as a result of preclinical study and clinical trial delays and\nadjustments;\n● challenges related to ongoing and increased operational expenses related to pandemics or public health\nemergencies or disruptions;\n● delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and\nclinical site staff;\n● delays, difficulties or increased costs to comply with COVID-19 or other public health related protocols at our\nleased facilities and clinical sites;\n● diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals\nserving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of clinical trials;\n● interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel\nimposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n● delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n● delays in preclinical and clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials;\n● interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials, such as investigational\ndrug product used in our clinical trials;\n● changes in regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies or\ndisruptions which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, or to\ndiscontinue the clinical trials altogether, or which may result in unexpected costs;\n● delays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and\ncontractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government or contractor personnel;\n● refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States; and\n● increased competition for contract research organizations (CROs), suppliers and vendors.\nAdditionally, certain third parties with whom we engage, including our collaborators, contract organizations, third-\nparty manufacturers, suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators and other third parties with whom we conduct business may\nadjust their operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies. If these third parties\nexperience shutdowns or continued business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the\ntimelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted. For example, we experienced delays in trial\ninitiation for our Phase 1 clinical trial of sevasemten and switched from an international third-party manufacturer to a\nthird-party manufacturer based in the United States to minimize manufacturing supply chain disruptions as a result of\nCOVID-19. Changing our third-party manufacturer could result in delays in our manufacturing supply chain which\ncould delay or otherwise impact our development of sevasemten and result in increased costs related to sevasemten.\nAdditionally, certain preclinical studies for our discovery research programs are conducted by CROs, which could be\ndiscontinued or delayed as a result of the pandemic. We could also experience delays if our suppliers are delayed in\ndelivering raw materials to our third-party manufacturers. For example, we experienced delays in enrolling patients for\nour Phase 1 clinical trial for sevasemten. In addition, our clinical trial sites could experience delays in collecting,\nreceiving, and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our\n38\nTable of Contents\nclinical trial for sevasemten due to limited staff at such sites, limitation or suspension of on-site visits by patients, or\npatients’ reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. As a result, research and development expenses\nand general and administrative expenses may vary significantly if there is an increased impact from COVID-19 or other\npublic health emergencies on the costs and timing associated with the conduct of our clinical trial and other related\nbusiness activities.\nIn the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 or other public health emergencies, we could be required to develop and\nimplement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from such diseases. During\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related guidance documents for sponsors and\nmanufacturers, many of which have expired or were withdrawn with the expiration of the COVID-19 public health\nemergency declaration on May 11, 2023, although some COVID-19 related guidance documents continue in effect.\nAny continued and prolonged public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material negative\nimpact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies or outbreaks adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks\ndescribed in this “Risk Factors” section.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, sevasemten. If we are unable to complete further\ndevelopment of, obtain approval for and commercialize sevasemten for one or more indications in a timely manner, our business\nwill be harmed.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to timely and successfully complete clinical trials, obtain marketing\napproval for and successfully commercialize sevasemten, our lead product candidate. We are investing the majority of\nour efforts and financial resources in the research and development of sevasemten. Sevasemten is in advanced clinical\ntrials in patients with Becker, Duchenne, and Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophies as well as McArdle Disease.\nSevasemten will require additional clinical development, expansion of manufacturing capabilities, marketing\napproval from government regulators, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we can generate\nany revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote sevasemten, or any other product candidate\nbefore we receive marketing approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never\nreceive such marketing approvals.\nThe success of sevasemten will depend on several factors, including the following:\n● the successful and timely completion of our ongoing nonclinical studies and clinical trial of sevasemten;\n● the initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials of sevasemten on a\ntimely basis;\n● maintaining and establishing relationships with CROs and clinical sites for the clinical development of\nsevasemten;\n● the frequency and severity of adverse events in clinical trials;\n● demonstrating efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA, EMA or any\ncomparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;\n39\nTable of Contents\n● the timely receipt of marketing approvals for sevasemten from applicable regulatory authorities;\n● maintaining the ODD and RPDD for sevasemten;\n● the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n● the maintenance of existing or the establishment of new supply arrangements with third-party drug product\nsuppliers and manufacturers for clinical development and, if approved, commercialization of sevasemten;\n● obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the\nUnited States and internationally;\n● protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n● our ability to expand sevasemten into multiple indications;\n● the successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval;\n● a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;\n● the actual market-size, ability to identify patients and the demographics of patients eligible for our product\ncandidates, which may be different than expected;\n● commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors, particularly since the\nproduct candidates we develop may be novel;\n● our ability to compete or combine with other therapies; and\n● addressing any delays, necessary adjustments and additional costs in nonclinical study and clinical trials\nresulting from factors related to public health pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe do not have complete control over many of these factors, including certain aspects of clinical development and\nthe regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing,\ndistribution and sales efforts of any future collaborator. If we are not successful with respect to one or more of these\nfactors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize\nsevasemten, which would materially harm our business. If we do not receive marketing approvals for sevasemten, we\nmay not be able to continue our operations.\nIn addition to sevasemten, our prospects depend in part upon developing and commercializing EDG -7500 and product\ncandidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and discovering, developing and commercializing product\ncandidates in future programs, which may fail or suffer delays that adversely affect their commercial viability.\nOur future operating results are dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and\ncommercialize EDG-7500, product candidates from our research program currently focused on cardiometabolic\nindications, or EDG-003, and our lead product candidate, sevasemten. EDG-7500 is currently in a multipart Phase 2 trial.\nHowever, research and development related to novel therapeutics is inherently risky. A product candidate can\nunexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical and/or clinical development. The historical failure rate for product\ncandidates is high due to risks relating to safety, efficacy, clinical execution, changing standards of medical care and\nother unpredictable variables. The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not\nbe predictive of the results that will be obtained in later stage clinical trials of the product candidate.\n40\nTable of Contents\nThe success of other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following:\n● generating sufficient data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n● obtaining regulatory permission to initiate clinical trials;\n● contracting with the necessary parties to conduct clinical trials;\n● successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, clinical trials on a timely basis;\n● the timely manufacture of sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n● adverse events in clinical trials; and\n● addressing any delays in our research programs resulting from factors related to public health pandemics,\nincluding the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEven if we successfully discover and advance any other product candidates into clinical development, their success\nwill be subject to all of the clinical, regulatory and commercial risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval of,\ncommercialize, or generate significant revenue from any product candidates.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. The clinical trials of our product\ncandidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities or otherwise produce positive results and the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be\npredictive of future results. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to\ncomplete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nAlthough we have announced positive results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, our product\ncandidates’ risk of failure is high and it is impossible to predict when or if sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from\nour EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program or any other product candidate that we develop will prove effective or safe\nin humans or will receive marketing approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from the FDA, EMA or other\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical\ndevelopment and extensive clinical trials to demonstrate with substantial evidence the safety and efficacy of such\nproduct candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and its ultimate\noutcome is uncertain. We cannot guarantee that any of our clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on\nschedule, or at all. Clinical trials can fail at any stage of testing and failure may result from a multitude of factors,\nincluding, among other things, flaws in study design, dose selection issues, placebo effects, patient enrollment criteria\nand failure to demonstrate favorable safety or efficacy traits. The outcome of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical\ntrials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. For example, our product candidates may fail to show\nthe desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies or having\nsuccessfully advanced through initial clinical trials. We may also discover that the half-life of our product candidates\nrenders them unsuitable for the therapeutic applications we have chosen. As a result, we cannot assure you that any\nclinical trials that we conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to support marketing approval.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage\nclinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials, and we cannot\nbe certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying\ninterpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in\npreclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain\n41\nTable of Contents\nmarketing approval of their drugs. Furthermore, the failure of any of our product candidates to demonstrate safety and\nefficacy in any clinical trial could negatively impact the perception of our other product candidates and/or cause the\nFDA or other regulatory authorities to require additional testing before approving any of our product candidates.\nWe have experienced delays in completing our ongoing clinical trial and may experience additional delays in\ninitiating or completing additional clinical trials including delays as a result of COVID-19. We may also experience\nnumerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent receipt of marketing\napproval or our ability to commercialize our product candidates, including:\n● receipt of feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n● clinical trial observations or results that require us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n● negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon\ncertain drug development programs;\n● obtaining approval from one or more institutional review boards (IRB);\n● the number of patients required for clinical trials being larger than anticipated, enrollment in these clinical\ntrials being slower than anticipated or participants dropping out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than\nanticipated;\n● any failure or delay in reaching an agreement with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be\nsubject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n● the suspension or termination of our clinical trials for various reasons, including non-compliance with\nregulatory requirements or a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other\nunexpected characteristics or risks;\n● changes to clinical trial protocol;\n● clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n● the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than anticipated;\n● the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our\nproduct candidates being insufficient or inadequate;\n● subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n● selection of clinical end points that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting\ndata;\n● a facility manufacturing our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMPs,\nregulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the\nmanufacturing process;\n● any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n● third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not\nperforming our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good\nclinical practices (GCP) or other regulatory requirements;\n42\nTable of Contents\n● third-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n● third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other\ngovernment or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to\nfind a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such\ncontractors in support of our marketing applications; and\n● regulators revising the requirements for approving our product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that\nwe currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other\ntesting in a timely manner, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there\nare safety concerns, we may incur unplanned costs, be delayed in seeking and obtaining marketing approval, if we\nreceive such approval at all, receive more limited or restrictive marketing approval, be subject to additional post-\nmarketing testing requirements or have the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nMoreover, in the future, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants\nto us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we\nmay be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA\nor comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal\ninvestigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable\nforeign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site\nand the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our\nmarketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately\nlead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the\ncommercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any\nof these product candidates will be delayed. Moreover, our product development costs will also increase if we\nexperience delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether\nany of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on\nschedule, or at all. We may also determine to change the design or protocol of one or more of our clinical trials, which\ncould result in increased costs and expenses and/or delays. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our\ncosts, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence\nproduct sales and generate revenues.\nIn addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the\ncommencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a\nproduct candidate. Any delays to our clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we may\nhave the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and our competitors may be able to bring products to\nmarket before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced. Any of\nthese occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nOur product candidates may cause serious adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used alone or in\ncombination with other approved products or investigational new drugs that may result in a safety profile that could prevent\nregulatory approval, prevent market acceptance, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nWe are developing novel biologically active small molecules for muscle related diseases. As a result, there is\nuncertainty as to the safety profile of product candidates we may develop. In addition, our product candidates may be\nused in combination with certain other therapies, including corticosteroids, which may have undesirable side effects. If\nour product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics in preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials when used alone or in combination with other approved products or\n43\nTable of Contents\ninvestigational new drugs we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more\nnarrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less\nsevere or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient\nrecruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of\nthese occurrences may prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate\nand may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nPatients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials may in the future suffer other adverse events or other side effects\nnot observed in our preclinical studies or previous clinical trials. For example, in the single ascending dose (SAD) trial\nfor sevasemten, dose limiting somnolence was observed at the 135 mg level. In addition, in the multiple ascending dose\n(MAD) trial for sevasemten, the most common adverse events were dizziness and somnolence, all of which were mild\nand transient. In the ARCH trial of sevasemten in adults wit Becker, the most common adverse events were dizziness,\nfall, and arthralgia, which were mild and transient. Sevasemten or other product candidates may be used in pediatric\npopulations for which safety concerns may be particularly scrutinized by regulatory agencies. In addition, if sevasemten\nis studied in combination with other therapies, it may exacerbate adverse events associated with the therapy. Patients\ntreated with sevasemten or our other product candidates may also be undergoing other therapies which can cause side\neffects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidate but may still impact the success of our clinical\ntrials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events\ndue to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients’ illnesses,\nwhich could occur either during the course of our clinical trials or after participating in such clinical trials.\nIf further serious adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we\nmay have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials, patients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to\nabandon the trials or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, EMA, other\ncomparable regulatory authorities or an IRB may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various\nreasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side\neffects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in\nearly-stage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side\neffects do not preclude the product candidate from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects\nmay inhibit market acceptance due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially\nharm our business, financial condition and prospects. Further, if any of our product candidates obtains marketing\napproval, toxicities associated with such product candidates previously not seen during clinical testing may also develop\nafter such approval and lead to a requirement to conduct additional clinical safety trials, additional contraindications,\nwarnings and precautions being added to the drug label, significant restrictions on the use of the product or the\nwithdrawal of the product from the market. We cannot predict whether our product candidates will cause toxicities in\nhumans that would preclude or lead to the revocation of regulatory approval based on preclinical studies or early stage\nclinical trials.\nThe outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and the\nresults of our clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities.\nWe will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product\ncandidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek marketing approvals for their\ncommercial sale. Success in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future clinical trials will\nbe successful. Although we have announced positive results from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we do not\nknow whether sevasemten or EDG-7500 will perform in current or future clinical trials as sevasemten has performed in\npreclinical studies or earlier clinical trials, nor do we know whether any product candidate in our EDG-003\ncardiometabolic discovery program will perform in current or future preclinical studies or future clinical trials as it has\nin prior preclinical studies. Product candidates in clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to\nthe satisfaction of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities despite having progressed through\npreclinical studies. Regulatory authorities may also limit the scope of later-stage trials until we have demonstrated\nsatisfactory safety, which could delay regulatory\n44\nTable of Contents\napproval, limit the size of the patient population to which we may market our product candidates, or prevent regulatory\napproval.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials\nof the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type\nof the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dose and dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the\nrate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Patients treated with our product candidates may also be undergoing\nother therapies and may be using other approved products or investigational new drugs, which can cause side effects or\nadverse events that are unrelated to our product candidates. As a result, assessments of efficacy can vary widely for a\nparticular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical trial. This subjectivity can increase the\nuncertainty of, and adversely impact, our clinical trial outcomes.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and\nsafety sufficient to obtain approval to market any of our product candidates.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our regulatory\nsubmissions or receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and\nenroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to such trial’s conclusion as required by the\nFDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of\nclinical trials. Our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we\nanticipate.\nFor sevasemten trials, we completed our open-label ARCH trial and completed enrollment of the DUNE Phase 2\nexercise challenge study at a single clinical trial site and our CANYON Phase 2 clinical trial at multiple sites. All other\nPhase 2 clinical trials are also being conducted at multiple sites. We have initiated an industry-sponsored, global,\nprospective registry investigating the natural history of adults with Becker aged 18 years and older. However, we may\nnot be successful in achieving our goal of establishing natural history reference data points and identifying future\neligibility for recruitment into our planned registrational trial in Becker. In addition, we completed the Phase 1 trial with\nEDG-7500 in healthy subjects and the Part A single-dose arm of the multipart Phase 2 Cirrus-CM trial in patient with\noHCM. However, we may experience difficulty with enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in the ongoing\nenrollment of Part B and Part C of the Phase 2 trial.\nWe are developing product candidates for severe muscle diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for\nclinical trials. Such trials may be difficult to enroll and the lack of data on these patients may negatively impact the\napprovability of sevasemten. We also may encounter difficulties in identifying and enrolling subjects with a stage of\ndisease appropriate for our planned clinical trials and monitoring such subjects adequately during and after treatment.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible\nsubjects to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In addition,\nthe process of finding and diagnosing subjects may prove costly. Further, the treating physicians in our clinical trials\nmay also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to\ntry alternative therapies.\nWe expect patient enrollment to be affected because our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for programs that\nare under development for the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible\nfor our clinical trials could instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors’ programs. Patient enrollment for our\ncurrent or any future clinical trials may be affected by other factors, including:\n● size and nature of the patient population;\n● perceived risks and benefits of novel, unproven approaches;\n● severity of the disease under investigation;\n45\nTable of Contents\n● availability and efficacy of approved drugs for the disease under investigation;\n● patient eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol;\n● perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n● clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in\nrelation to other available therapies, including any new products that may be approved or other product\ncandidates being investigated for the indications we are investigating;\n● patient referral practices of physicians;\n● the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n● the activities of key opinion leaders (KOLs) and patient advocacy groups;\n● proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and\n● the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion or, because they may\nhave an advanced disease, will not survive the full terms of the clinical trials.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may\nrequire us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in\nincreased development costs for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to obtain marketing approval for the\nsale of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical\ntrials, we may have difficulty maintaining participation in our clinical trials through the treatment and any follow-up\nperiods.\nWe have limited resources and are currently focusing the majority of our efforts on developing sevasemten and EDG-7500 for\nparticular indications. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on other indications or product candidates that may ultimately have\nproven to be more profitable.\nWe are currently focusing the majority of our resources and efforts on developing sevasemten and EDG-7500. As a\nresult, because we have limited resources, we may forgo or delay the pursuit of opportunities for other indications or\nwith other product candidates that may have greater commercial potential, including product candidates from our EDG-\n003 cardiometabolic discovery program. In addition, while we currently have multiple compounds in our programs, we\nare focusing our efforts on select product candidates from each of these programs to develop as lead product candidates\nin each program. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or\nprofitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development activities for sevasemten,\nEDG-7500 and our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program may not yield any commercially viable products. If we\ndo not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target markets for sevasemten, EDG-7500 or the product\ncandidates we are currently researching, such as those from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program, we may\nrelinquish valuable rights to our product candidates or programs through collaboration, licensing or other strategic\narrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and\ncommercialization rights to such product candidate or program.\nWe face significant competition and if our competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than we do or\nthat are more effective, safer or less expensive than the products we develop, our commercial opportunities will be negatively\nimpacted.\nThe biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense\ncompetition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. Our competitors have\ndeveloped, are developing or may develop products, product candidates and processes\n46\nTable of Contents\ncompetitive with our product candidates. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will\ncompete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that a significant\nnumber of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the\ntreatment of conditions for which we may attempt to develop product candidates.\nWe have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical\ncompanies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, emerging and start-up\ncompanies, universities and other research institutions. We also compete with other organizations to recruit\nmanagement, scientists and clinical development personnel, which could negatively affect our level of expertise and our\nability to execute our business plan. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling subjects\nfor clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nWith sevasemten, we expect to face competition from existing products and products in development.\nApproximately 70% of patients with Duchenne are treated with corticosteroids to manage the inflammatory component\nof the disease. Deflazacort and prednisone are FDA-approved corticosteroids and are marketed by multiple companies.\nIn October 2023, the FDA granted Agamree (vamorolone) approval in Duchenne patients aged 2 years and older and\nCatalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced commercialization of this product in the United States in March 2024\nfollowing its North America exclusive license deal with Santhera. In addition, there are four exon skipping drugs which\nare marketed under an accelerated approval pathway from the FDA: EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen), AMONDYS 45\n(casimersen) and VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen), which are naked phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs)\napproved for the treatment of Duchenne patients amenable to Exon 51, Exon 45 and Exon 53 skipping, respectively, and\nare marketed by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., and VILTEPSO (vitolarsen), a naked PMO approved for the treatment of\nDuchenne patients amenable to Exon 53 skipping, which is marketed by Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. In May 2024,\nNippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. announced that no statistical significance was observed between the treatment group and the\nplacebo group in VILTEPSO’s confirmatory study. This result may affect VILTEPSO’s accelerated FDA approval. In\nJune 2022, PTC Therapeutics presented new topline results with Translarna (ataluren), for patients with nonsense\nmutation Duchenne, a subset of the disease that impacts between 10% and 15% of patients. It remains unclear if the data\nwill lead to FDA approval of Translarna, for which the company resubmitted the NDA in July 2024. Translarna has been\nconditionally approved in the European Union and Brazil for ambulatory patients aged 2 years and older with Duchenne\nresulting from a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. However, in January and June 2024, the Committee for\nMedicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA delivered negative opinions on the re-examination procedure for the\nconditional marketing authorization of Translarna. This is expected to result in the withdrawal of Translarna from the\nEMA markets. In June 2023, the FDA approved Sarepta’s Biologics License Application seeking accelerated approval of\ntheir microdystrophin gene therapy, Elevidys (delandistrogene moxeparvovec), for the treatment of ambulant individuals\nwith Duchenne between the ages of four to five years. In June 2024, the FDA granted Elevidys full approval for the\ntreatment of ambulatory individuals aged 4 years and older, and accelerated approval for the treatment of non-\nambulatory individuals aged 4 years and older. Other companies focused on developing genetic based therapies for\nDuchenne that target dystrophin mechanisms include Solid Biosciences Inc., Genethon, PepGen, Dyne Therapeutics,\nAvidity Biosciences, REGENXBIO, Wave Life Sciences, and Entrada Therapeutics. In June 2024, Pfizer announced its\ngene therapy Phase 3 study failed to meet the primary and key secondary endpoints and is no longer under development.\nGene editing treatments that are in preclinical development are also being pursued by Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics.\nWe are also aware of several companies targeting non-dystrophin mechanisms for the treatment of Duchenne. In\nJune 2022, Italfarmaco announced positive topline data from its completed Phase 3 trial with givinostat, a histone\ndeacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in boys with Duchenne. In March 2024, the FDA approved Duvyzat (givinostat) for the\ntreatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients aged six years and older. Moreover, in June 2021, Italfarmaco\nreleased top line Phase 2 data for givinostat in Becker. Givinostat did not show a significant difference in the primary\nendpoint compared to placebo. The future of this program in Becker is uncertain.\nWith EDG-7500, we expect to face competition from existing products and products in development. Current\npharmaceutical treatment is intended to improve diastolic filling in both obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n47\nTable of Contents\n(oHCM) and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (nHCM) and reduce left ventricular outflow tract gradient in\noHCM patients only. The goal of current therapies is to achieve meaningful symptom relief. Non-vasodilating beta blockers\nand non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the first-line therapies for symptomatic oHCM and nHCM patients.\nCommonly prescribed beta-blockers are atenolol, propranolol, and metoprolol. Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel\nblockers used in the treatment of symptomatic oHCM and nHCM. For oHCM patients who remain symptomatic,\ndisopyramide (either Norpace, marketed by Pfizer, or a generic form marketed by several companies) or Camzyos\n(mayacamten) may also be added.\nIn the field of emerging treatments intended to treat HCM, competitors include Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS),\nCytokinetics, Imbria Pharmaceuticals, and Celltrion. Cytokinetics is developing a CMI, aficamten (CK-274), for which\npositive topline Phase 3 oHCM trial results were reported in December 2023. In June 2023, Cytokinetics initiated another\nPhase 3 active-comparator clinical trial of aficamten compared to metoprolol in symptomatic oHCM patients (MAPLE trial).\nIn the second quarter of 2024, BMS and Cytokinetics initiated a study of mavacamten and aficamten, respectively, in pediatric\npopulation with symptomatic oHCM. BMS and Cytokinetics are also exploring their respective CMIs in ongoing Phase 3\nnHCM clinical trials, and both are also developing next generation CMIs for the treatment of symptomatic HCM, CK-271 and\nMYK-224, respectively. A Phase 2 oHCM clinical trial of MYK-224 is currently ongoing.\nNon-CMI targeting drugs in development include IMB-101(Imbria Pharmaceuticals), a prodrug of a 3-ketoacyl CoA\nthiolase enzyme inhibitor, CT-G20 (Celltrion), an anti-arrhythmic cibenzoline succinate, and trientine dihydrochloride (Univar\nSolutions), a selective copper II chelator. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals announced plans to investigate sotagliflozin, an SGLT1\nand SGLT2 inhibitor, in a Phase 3 study of obstructive and non-obstructive HCM patients. In March 2024, the results of a\nPhase 2 trial in nHCM of IMB-101 were published. We have limited knowledge of CT-G20’s Phase 1 oHCM trial status,\nwhile the trientine Phase 2 oHCM clinical trial is ongoing. A gene therapy approach, TN-201, a myosin binding protein C3-\ntargeting gene therapy candidate being developed by Tenaya Therapeutics for genetic HCM, is currently in Phase 1b. We are\naware of several preclinical HCM programs including: JN-210, a microRNA activating gene therapy approach being\ndeveloped by Jaan Biotherapeutics; HTX-001, an antisense oligonucleotide approach being developed by Haya Therapeutics;\nCDR348T and CDR641L, both are non-coding RNA-based therapies being developed by Cardior Pharmaceuticals (acquired\nby Novo Nordisk in May 2024). We are also aware of several early-stage preclinical HCM assets being developed by\nDiNAQOR in collaboration with BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMN-293/DINA-001) and Lexeo Therapeutics (LX2022), both\nare gene therapy approaches for genetic HCM. In April 2024, BioMarin announced the discontinuation of the development of\nBMN-293.\nMany of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing,\ndrug development, technical and human resources and commercial expertise than we do. Large pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals,\nrecruiting patients and manufacturing biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research\nand marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of\ndevelopment, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions.\nEstablished pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and\ndevelopment of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we\ndevelop obsolete. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through\ncollaborative arrangements with large and established companies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary\nto, or necessary for, our programs. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval\nfrom the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and\ncommercializing products in our field before we do.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products\nthat are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more\neffectively, are more widely reimbursed or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors\nalso may obtain marketing approval from the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their\nproducts more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong\nmarket position before we are able to enter the market. Even if the product candidates we develop achieve marketing\napproval, they may be priced at a significant premium over competitive\n48\nTable of Contents\nproducts if any have been approved by then, resulting in reduced competitiveness. Technological advances or products\ndeveloped by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not\neconomical. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of our products\nwe may develop, if approved, could be adversely affected.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change as more patient data\nbecomes available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from our clinical trials. For\nexample, on April 15, 2024, we announced positive two-year topline results from the ARCH open label trial of\nsevasemten in adults with Becker and on September 19, 2024, we announced positive topline data from the Phase 1 trial\nof EDG-7500 in healthy subjects and the Part A single-dose arm of the Phase 2 multipart CIRRUS-HCM trial in patients\nwith oHCM. These interim updates are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related\nfindings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the\nparticular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of\ndata, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the\ntopline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or\nconsiderations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also\nremain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the\npreliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are\navailable. In addition, we may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than all endpoints. Interim data\nfrom clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially\nchange as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available. Adverse changes between interim data\nand final data could significantly harm our business and prospects. Further, additional disclosure of interim data by us or\nby our competitors in the future could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates,\ncalculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact\nthe value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or\nproduct and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular\nstudy or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we\ndetermine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the preliminary or topline data\nthat we report differ from late, final or actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the\nconclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates\nfrom our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program or any other product candidates may be harmed, which could\nharm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to develop a proprietary drug discovery platform to build a pipeline of product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to leverage our proprietary drug discovery platform and our ability to design small\nmolecule inhibitors of fast skeletal myosin to expand our pipeline of product candidates. We are leveraging our\nproprietary drug discovery platform and capabilities to create precision medicines for muscle diseases with high levels\nof unmet need. In order to do so, we must continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery platform and\ndevelopment capabilities. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in a pipeline of product\ncandidates, these product candidates may not be safe and effective. In addition, although we expect that our proprietary\ndrug discovery platform will allow us to develop a diverse pipeline of product candidates across multiple therapeutic\nareas, we may not prove to be successful at doing so. Furthermore, we may also find that the uses of our proprietary\ndrug discovery platform are limited because alternative uses of our therapeutics prove not to be safe or effective. Even if\nwe are successful in building our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for\nclinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side\n49\nTable of Contents\neffects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval or\nachieve market acceptance. Further, because our product candidates and development programs are based on our\nproprietary drug discovery platform, adverse developments with respect to one of our programs may have a significant\nadverse impact on the actual or perceived likelihood of success and value of our other programs.\nIn addition, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our approach. If we fail to\nstay at the forefront of technological change in utilizing our proprietary drug discovery platform to create and develop\nproduct candidates, we may be unable to compete effectively. Our competitors may render our approach obsolete or\nlimit the commercial value of our product candidates, by advances in existing technological approaches or the\ndevelopment of new or different approaches, potentially eliminating the advantages in our drug discovery process that\nwe believe we derive from our research approach and proprietary technologies. By contrast, adverse developments with\nrespect to other companies that attempt to use a similar approach to our approach may adversely impact the actual or\nperceived value of our proprietary drug discovery platform and potential of our product candidates. If any of these\nevents occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations.\nWe may develop sevasemten and potentially other programs in combination with other therapies, which would expose us to\nadditional risks.\nWe may develop sevasemten and potentially other programs, in combination with one or more currently approved\ntherapies or therapies in development. Patients may not be able to tolerate sevasemten or any other product candidates in\ncombination with other therapies or dosing of sevasemten in combination with other therapies may have unexpected\nconsequences. Even if any of our product candidates were to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use\nin combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA, EMA or other\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with any of our\nproduct candidates, or safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies. In\naddition, it is possible that existing therapies with which our product candidates are approved for use could themselves\nfall out of favor. This could result in the need to identify other combination therapies for our product candidates, or our\nown products being removed from the market or being less successful commercially.\nWe may also evaluate our product candidates in combination with one or more other therapies that have not yet\nbeen approved for marketing by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to\nmarket and sell any product candidate in combination with any such unapproved therapies that do not ultimately obtain\nmarketing approval.\nIf the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve or revoke their approval of\nthese other therapies, or if safety, efficacy, commercial adoption, manufacturing or supply issues arise with the therapies\nwe may choose to evaluate in combination with sevasemten or any other product candidate, we may be unable to obtain\napproval of or successfully market any one or all of the product candidates we develop.\nAdditionally, if the third-party providers of therapies or therapies in development used in combination with our\nproduct candidates are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization of our product\ncandidates, or if the cost of combination therapies are prohibitive, our development and commercialization efforts would\nbe impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth\nprospects.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe manufacture of drugs is complex, and our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If any of our\nthird-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide adequate supply of our product candidates for\nclinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or prevented.\nManufacturing drugs, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies.\nEach lot of an approved drug product must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency.\nManufacturing drugs requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, as well as sophisticated\nquality assurance and quality control procedures. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including\nfilling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures or product\nrecalls. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, we may be required to provide preclinical and clinical\ndata showing the comparable quality and efficacy of the products before and after such changes. If our third-party\nmanufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization as a result of these\nchallenges, or otherwise, our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nChanges in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates progress through preclinical and clinical trials to marketing approval and commercialization,\nit is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are\naltered along the way in an effort to optimize yield and manufacturing batch size, minimize costs and achieve consistent\nquality and results. For example, we may explore alternate sevasemten formulations for use with pediatric patients,\nparticularly Duchenne patients, who may have difficulty taking adult formulations. Such changes carry the risk that they\nwill not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause our product candidates to perform\ndifferently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered\nmaterials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of\none or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates and jeopardize our\nability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and generate revenue.\nOur product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others\nin the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain adequate market acceptance among\nphysicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of\nour approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n● the efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials compared to alternative treatments;\n● the timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which a product candidate is approved;\n● restrictions on the use of product candidates in the labeling approved by regulatory authorities, such as boxed\nwarnings or contraindications in labeling, or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, if any, which may not be\nrequired of alternative treatments and competitor products;\n● the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n● the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n● the availability of an approved product candidate for use as a combination therapy;\n51\nTable of Contents\n● relative convenience and ease of administration;\n● the willingness of the target patient population or their caregivers to try new therapies and of physicians to\nprescribe these therapies;\n● the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government\nauthorities;\n● patients’ willingness to pay for these therapies in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n● the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n● support from KOLs and patient advocacy groups;\n● unfavorable publicity relating to our product candidates; and\n● the approval of other new therapies for the same indications.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians,\nhospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate\nand our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe patient population suffering from Duchenne, Becker and Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is small and has not\nbeen established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve\nprofitability may be adversely affected. Because the target patient populations of our programs are small and the addressable\npatient population may be even smaller, we must be able to successfully identify patients and capture a significant market share\nto achieve profitability and growth.\nDuchenne and Becker are rare, genetic neuromuscular disorders. We estimate that Duchenne occurs in\napproximately 35,000 patients in the US, EU (5) and Japan. Becker has a much lower incidence of approximately 1 in\nevery 18,450 live male births. We estimate that Becker occurs in approximately 12,000 patients in the US, EU (5) and\nJapan. The approximate global prevalence of LGMDs as a group is estimated to be from 0.56 to 5.75 per 100,000. Our\nestimates of the size of these patient populations are based on published studies. Given the small number of patients who\nhave the diseases that we are targeting, it is critical to our ability to grow and become profitable that we continue to\nsuccessfully identify patients with these rare diseases. The effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in\nearly stages, and we cannot accurately predict the number of patients for whom treatment might be possible. Various\nfactors may decrease the market size of our product and product candidates, including the severity of the disease, patient\ndemographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our product candidates. If the results of these studies or\nour analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be\ninaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability.\nThe effort to identify patients with diseases we seek to treat is in early stages and we cannot accurately predict the\nnumber of patients for whom treatment might be possible. A newborn screening initiative was put into place with the\ngoal of identifying and providing care for every child born with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and achieving\nRecommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) status. An Ohio newborn screening (NBS) program was announced in\nApril 2024 in which all newborns in the state of Ohio are screened for Duchenne. A newborn screening pilot program in\nNew York State tested this and other aspects of a comprehensive newborn screening program at a large scale. The pilot\nwas completed in October 2021 and screened more than 36,000 babies born in New York State over two years. Four\nbabies were confirmed to have Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, and one baby was identified as a carrier female.\nTwo other pilot programs have been successfully conducted. In June 2022, Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, a\nnonprofit organization leading the fight to end Duchenne, announced that the organization submitted a nomination\npackage to add Duchenne to the RUSP to the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children\n(ACHDNC), initiating the review process. The review process\n52\nTable of Contents\ntypically takes more than a year and requires two key votes of experts in NBS to move forward. In February 2023, the\nfirst key vote took place and the ACHDNC decided that more information was needed before proceeding to the second\nvote. Work is ongoing to provide the required additional information. However, the ACHDNC may decide that the\nalgorithm developed for accurately detecting muscular dystrophy is not scalable or cost-effective, thus not appropriate\nfor national and state level implementation. In addition, the ACHDNC may decide not to add Duchenne to the RUSP for\nother reasons. Furthermore, even if Duchenne is added to the RUSP, states may not be able to effectively implement a\nNBS program. This could reduce the identifiable patient population for the diseases we seek to treat and result in our\ntherapies not being able to be initiated early in the course of the disease.\nAdditionally, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or\nmay not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to\nidentify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Further, even if we\nobtain significant market share for our product candidates, because the potential target populations are very small, we\nmay never achieve profitability despite obtaining such significant market share.\nWe may not be successful in augmenting our product pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe intend to evaluate select external opportunities to strategically expand our pipeline. While we plan to leverage\nour leadership team’s prior business development experience as we evaluate potential in-licensing and acquisition\nopportunities to expand our portfolio, we may not be able to identify suitable licensing or acquisition opportunities, and\neven if we do, we may not be able to successfully secure such licensing and acquisition opportunities. The licensing or\nacquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may\npursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or\nnecessary. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater\nclinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may\nbe unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual\nproperty rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. If we are unable\nto successfully license or acquire additional product candidates to expand our portfolio, our pipeline, competitive\nposition, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be materially harmed.\nAny product candidates we develop may become subject to unfavorable third-party coverage and reimbursement practices, as\nwell as pricing regulations.\nThe availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors including government\nhealth administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party\npayors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. The initial targets in our pipeline are\nindications with small patient populations. For product candidates that are designed to treat smaller patient populations\nto be commercially viable, the reimbursement for such product candidates must be higher, on a relative basis, to account\nfor the lack of volume. Accordingly, we will need to implement a coverage and reimbursement strategy for any\napproved product candidate that accounts for the smaller potential market size.\nSales of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval will depend substantially, both in the United\nStates and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of such product candidates will be covered and reimbursed by\nthird-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to\nsuccessfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount\nmay not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize an adequate return on our\ninvestment. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which\nwe obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to\nlimited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved\nproducts. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically\n53\nTable of Contents\nmade by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services (HHS). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under\nMedicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a\nsubstantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not\nassure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate or at the same level of reimbursement. As a\nresult, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. This process will require us to provide\nscientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that\ncoverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nIncreasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from\nlist prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging\nthe price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There\nmay be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party\npayors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not\ninclude all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic\nstudies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Nonetheless, our product candidates\nmay not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will\nbe available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement\nwill be.\nOutside the United States, the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental\nprice controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in\nEurope, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such\nas our product candidates. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union (EU), medical product\nprices are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing\nnegotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a product receives marketing approval. To\nobtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that\ncompares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. In general, product prices under\nsuch systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices\nfor products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing\nregulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets\noutside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may\nbe insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nIf we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for any product candidates from\nthird-party payors, the adoption of those products and sales revenue will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could\nadversely affect the ability to market or sell those product candidates, if approved. Coverage policies and third-party\npayor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for\none or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement\nrates may be implemented in the future.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and if we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, such\ninability could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If product liability lawsuits are brought against us,\nwe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing\nand marketing of therapeutic treatments. We currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for\nour stage of development and may need to obtain higher levels prior to marketing any of our product candidates, if\napproved. Any insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities.\nFurthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be\nunable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims\nthat could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Also, our insurance policies may have various\nexclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for\n54\nTable of Contents\nwhich we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that\nexceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain,\nsufficient capital to pay such amounts. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to\nindemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nWe may be sued if any of our product candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise\nunsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing, or sale post-approval. Any such product liability claims\nmay include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the\nproduct, negligence, strict liability, or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer\nprotection laws. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial\nliabilities or be required to limit testing and commercialization of our products. Even successful defense would require\nsignificant financial and management resources.\nRegardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n● delays in the development of our product candidates;\n● FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our\nmanufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs;\n● decreased or interrupted demand for our products;\n● injury to our reputation;\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● costs to defend the related litigation;\n● a diversion of management’s time and our resources;\n● substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n● product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions;\n● loss of revenue;\n● exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n● the inability to commercialize any products.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time\nconsuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we\nwill be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\nOur product candidates are and will continue to be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among\nother things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting,\nlabeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous\npreclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process must be successfully\n55\nTable of Contents\ncompleted in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be approved for marketing.\nObtaining approval by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities is costly, unpredictable,\ntypically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including\nthe type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the\ntype and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s\nclinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to\napprove an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to\naccept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical,\nclinical or other data. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval for our product candidates,\nthe FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may approve our product candidates for a more\nlimited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested or may impose other prescribing\nlimitations or warnings that limit the product’s commercial potential. We have not submitted for, or obtained, regulatory\napproval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our product candidates will ever obtain regulatory\napproval. Further, development of our product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond\nour control. We cannot provide any assurance that any product candidate we may develop will progress through required\nclinical testing and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them.\nWe have not conducted, managed or completed large-scale or pivotal clinical trials nor managed the regulatory\napproval process with the FDA or any other regulatory authority. Applications for our product candidates could fail to\nreceive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n● the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design,\nimplementation or results of our clinical trials;\n● the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates\nare not safe and effective, are only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects,\ntoxicities or other characteristics that preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial\nuse;\n● the population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and\nsafety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n● the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data\nfrom preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our\nproduct candidate’s risk-benefit ratio for its proposed indication is acceptable;\n● the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing\nprocesses, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract\nfor clinical and commercial supplies; and\n● the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may\nsignificantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our\nfailing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our\nbusiness, results of operations and prospects. Any delay or failure in seeking or obtaining required approvals would have\na material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from any particular product candidates we are\ndeveloping and for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be\nsubject to significant limitations on the approved uses or indications for which we may market, promote and advertise\nthe drug or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and\nMitigation Strategy (REMS) plan as part of approving an NDA, or after approval, which may impose further\nrequirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. These requirements or restrictions might\ninclude limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone\n56\nTable of Contents\nspecialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to\nenroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may significantly limit the size of the market for the drug and\naffect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of\nclinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign\nregulatory approval process varies among countries, and generally includes all of the risks associated with FDA and\nEMA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign\njurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nThe FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from trials conducted in locations\noutside of their jurisdiction.\nOur ongoing clinical trials are being undertaken in the United States. We may choose to conduct additional clinical\ntrials internationally. The acceptance of study data by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority\nfrom clinical trials conducted outside of their respective jurisdictions may be subject to certain conditions. In cases\nwhere data from United States clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the foreign\ncountries outside the United States, the standards for clinical trials and approval may be different. There can be no\nassurance that any United States or foreign regulatory authority would accept data from trials conducted outside of its\napplicable jurisdiction. If the FDA, EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it\nwould result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our\nbusiness plan, and which may result in our product candidates not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization\nin the applicable jurisdiction.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be\nsuccessful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that\nwe will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA or\nEMA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must\nalso approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of the product candidate in those\ncountries. Complying with new requirements and changes in other foreign regulations that apply to clinical trials and\ndrug development activities can delay our clinical trials and regulatory approval timelines in the EU and other foreign\njurisdictions. For example, the Clinical Trials Regulation EU No. 536/2014 entered into application on January 31, 2022\nand is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance in EU.\nComplying with such new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive,\nresulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nHowever, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the\nregulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and\nadministrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or\nclinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other\njurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement\nbefore it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products\nis also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory\nrequirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction\nof our products in certain countries. If we or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in\ninternational markets or fail to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability\nto realize the full market potential of our potential product candidates will be harmed.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe regulatory approval processes for product candidates that target rare diseases, including Duchenne, Becker and LGMD are\nuncertain.\nDue to the lack of precedent, broad discretion of regulatory authorities, and a multitude of unique factors that\nimpact the regulatory approval process, the likelihood of the approval of any of our product candidates that target rare\ndiseases, such as Duchenne, Becker and LGMD is uncertain, and we may not be able to anticipate, prepare for or satisfy\nrequests or requirements from regulatory authorities, including completing and submitting planned Investigational New\nDrug (IND) and NDA for our product candidates, in a timely manner, or at all. For example, Duchenne is a rare disease\nfor which there are only two FDA approved therapeutics. In addition, no therapies are currently approved for Becker in\nthe United States or the EU. Further, the FDA may determine, after evaluation of our data and analyses, that such data\nand analyses do not support an NDA submission, filing or approval. Due to this lack of predictability, we may not have\nthe resources necessary to meet regulatory requirements and successfully complete a potentially protracted, expensive\nand wide-ranging approval process for commercialization of product candidates for rare diseases.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they will be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory\nrequirements and oversight.\nAny regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will require the submission of reports to\nregulatory authorities and on-going surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, may contain\nsignificant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications,\nand may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements and regulatory inspection. For\nexample, the FDA may require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for\na medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as\nrestricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or foreign\nregulatory authorities approve our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution,\nadverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates\nwill be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and\nother post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as on-going compliance with cGMPs and GCPs for\nany clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are\nsubject to continual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for\ncompliance with cGMP regulations and standards. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems\nwith a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the\nproduct is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us,\nincluding requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. In addition,\nfailure to comply with FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may subject our company to\nadministrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n● delays in or the rejection of product approvals;\n● restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or\nplanned trials;\n● restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process;\n● warning or untitled letters;\n● civil and criminal penalties;\n● injunctions;\n● suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n● product seizures, detentions or import bans;\n● voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements;\n58\nTable of Contents\n● total or partial suspension of production; and\n● imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product\ncandidates, if approved, and generate revenue. Furthermore, non-compliance by us or any future collaborator with\nregulatory requirements, including safety monitoring and with requirements related to the development of products for\nthe pediatric population can also result in significant financial penalties.\nFurther, the FDA’s or other ex-U.S. regulators’ policies may change, and additional government regulations may be\nenacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court\noverruled the Chevron doctrine, which gives deference to regulatory agencies’ statutory interpretations in litigation against\nfederal government agencies, such as the FDA, where the law is ambiguous. This landmark Supreme Court decision may\ninvite more companies and other stakeholders to bring lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and\npolicies of the FDA, including FDA’s statutory interpretations of market exclusivities and the “substantial evidence”\nrequirements for drug approvals, which could undermine the FDA's authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt\nthe FDA's normal operations, any of which could delay the FDA’s review of our regulatory submissions. We cannot predict\nthe full impact of this decision, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government\nregulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in\nexisting requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance,\nwe may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and\nability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates\nand, even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, from\napproving competing products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, may designate drugs for\nrelatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as\nan orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient\npopulation of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000\nin the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from\nsales in the United States. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain orphan designations for\nour product candidates.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant\nfunding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug\ndesignation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is\nentitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in the United States provides that the FDA may not approve\nany other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in\nlimited circumstances. The applicable exclusivity period is 10 years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be\nreduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently\nprofitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nThe FDA granted sevasemten Fast Track designation for the treatment of Duchenne in February 2024, and ODD for\nthe treatment of Duchenne and Becker and RPDD for the treatment of Duchenne in November 2023. The FDA\npreviously granted Fast Track designation for the investigation and development of sevasemten for the treatment of\nBecker. EMA granted ODD for sevasemten for the treatment of Becker and Duchenne in April 2024. We may seek\norphan drug designation for other product candidates. Even after obtaining orphan drug designation, we may not be able\nto obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for that product candidate. We may not be the first to obtain marketing\napproval of any product candidate for which we have obtained orphan drug designation for the orphan-designated\nindication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing\nrights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated\nindication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for\n59\nTable of Contents\ndesignation was materially defective or if we are unable to ensure that we will be able to manufacture sufficient\nquantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, even after obtaining\norphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because\ndifferent drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is\napproved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the\nFDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major\ncontribution to patient care or the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is unable to maintain sufficient\nproduct quantity. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug\nnor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process or entitles the product\ncandidate to priority review. In view of the court decision in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir.\n2021), in January 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies\nwith the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to\nmatters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug\nexclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a\ndrug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been\napproved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the\nscope of the orphan drug exclusivity.\nWhere appropriate, we plan to secure approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities through the use of\naccelerated registration pathways. If we are unable to obtain such approval, we may be required to conduct additional preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, and delay the receipt\nof, necessary marketing approvals. Even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, if our confirmatory trials do not verify\nclinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, the FDA may seek to withdraw accelerated\napproval.\nWhere possible, we plan to pursue accelerated development strategies in areas of high unmet need. We may seek an\naccelerated approval pathway for our one or more of our product candidates. Under the accelerated approval provisions\nin the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the FDA’s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated\napproval to a product candidate designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful\ntherapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate\nendpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a\nclinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as\nirreversible morbidity or mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a\nlaboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit,\nbut is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be\nmeasured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on\nirreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in\nwhich the advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage but is a clinically\nimportant improvement from a patient and public health perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is usually\ncontingent on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to\nverify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit,\nthe FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act reformed the accelerated\napproval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting\nforth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval\nrequirements.\nPrior to seeking such accelerated approval, we will seek feedback from the FDA and will otherwise evaluate our\nability to seek and receive such accelerated approval. There can be no assurance that after our evaluation of the feedback\nand other factors we will decide to pursue or submit an NDA for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited\ndevelopment, review or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance that after subsequent FDA feedback we will\ncontinue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval,\neven if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we decide to submit an application for\n60\nTable of Contents\naccelerated approval or under another expedited regulatory designation (e.g., breakthrough therapy designation), there\ncan be no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted or that any expedited development, review or\napproval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities could\nalso require us to conduct further studies prior to considering our application or granting approval of any type. A failure\nto obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval for our product\ncandidate would result in a longer time period to commercialization of such product candidate, could increase the cost\nof development of such product candidate and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation.\nExisting regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent,\nlimit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of\ngovernment regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or\nabroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or\npolicies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have\nobtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future\nlegislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of\nthe current U.S. administration may impact our business and industry, which could impose significant burdens on, or\notherwise materially delay, the FDA’s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as\nimplementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It\nis difficult to predict how current and future legislation, executive actions, and litigation, including the executive orders\nreferenced below, will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact our business, our clinical development,\nand the FDA’s and other agencies’ ability to exercise their regulatory authority, including FDA’s pre-approval inspection\nand timely review of any regulatory filings or applications we submit to the FDA. If these executive actions impose\nconstraints on FDA’s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course or constraints on\nour business operations, including operations of our contractors, our business may be negatively impacted.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health\nCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), was passed, which substantially changed the\nway healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S.\npharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of\nthe ACA. In June 2021, the United States Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to\nchallenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the\nACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, or healthcare\nmeasures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for\npurposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs\ncertain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare,\nincluding among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work\nrequirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through\nMedicaid or the ACA. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and\nexpensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was\nenacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year,\neffective April 1, 2013, which will remain in effect through 2032, unless additional congressional action is taken. In\nJanuary 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things,\nreduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to\nrecover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in\n61\nTable of Contents\nadditional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers\nfor our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers\nset prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted\nfederal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the\nrelationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement\nmethodologies for drug products. For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 eliminated the statutory cap on\nMedicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs. Elimination of this cap may\nrequire pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a\nmaterial impact on our business. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting\nCompetition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at increasing competition for prescription\ndrugs. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug\nprovisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including\nallowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs,\nimposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements,\nrequiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase\nfaster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries,\namong other changes. Various industry stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, have initiated lawsuits against the federal\ngovernment asserting that the price negotiation provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional. The\nimpact of these judicial challenges as well as future judicial challenges in view of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturn of the\nChevron doctrine, and other legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and\nagency rules implemented by the government on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The\nimplementation of cost containment measures, including the prescription drug provisions under the Inflation Reduction\nAct, as well as other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or\ncommercialize our product candidates if approved.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control\npharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain\nproduct access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage\nimportation from other countries and bulk purchasing. A number of states are considering or have recently enacted state\ndrug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to\ngreater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of\nour products. For example, FDA recently authorized the state of Florida to import certain prescription drugs from\nCanada for a period of two years to help reduce drug costs, provided that Florida’s Agency for Health Care\nAdministration meets the requirements set forth by the FDA. Other states may follow Florida. We are unable to predict\nthe future course of federal or state healthcare measures in the United States directed at broadening the availability of\nhealthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory\nframework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could also have a material and adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result\nin more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved\nproduct. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction\nin payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may\nprevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and\npromotional activities for biotechnology products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be\nenacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes\non the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny\n62\nTable of Contents\nby Congress of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us\nto more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and personal information security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and\nis likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign government\nbodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations limiting, or laws and regulations\nregarding, the collection, distribution, use, disclosure, storage, security and other processing of personal information.\nAdditionally, the collection and use of health data and other personal data is governed in the EU by the General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), which extends the geographical scope of EU data protection law to entities and\noperations outside of the EU under certain conditions and imposes substantial obligations upon companies and new\nrights for individuals, and by certain EU member state-level legislation. Failure to comply with the GDPR may result in\nfines up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is\nhigher, and other administrative penalties. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and liability in relation to\napplicable personal data that we or our CROs and other contractors and service providers may process, and we may be\nrequired to put in place additional measures in an effort to comply with the GDPR and with other laws and regulations\nin the EU, including those of EU member states, relating to privacy and data protection. These efforts may require\nsubstantial efforts and incurring significant costs. If our efforts to comply with the GDPR or other applicable EU laws\nand regulations are not successful, or are perceived to be unsuccessful, it could adversely affect our business in the EU.\nFurther, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which had enabled\nthe transfer of personal data from the EU to the U.S. for companies that had self-certified to the Privacy Shield in July\n2020. The CJEU decision also raised questions about the continued validity of one of the primary alternatives to the EU-\nU.S. Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses (SCCs), and EU regulators have\nissued additional guidance regarding considerations and requirements that we and other companies must consider and\nundertake when using the SCCs. EU regulators have released updated standard contractual clauses that are required to\nbe implemented. The CJEU’s decision and other regulatory guidance or developments otherwise may impose additional\nobligations with respect to the transfer of personal data from the EU, United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland to the U.S.,\nand we may be required to engage in additional contractual negotiations relating to the new SCCs or otherwise, each of\nwhich could restrict our activities in those jurisdictions, limit our ability to provide our products and services in those\njurisdictions, or increase our costs and obligations and impose limitations upon our ability to efficiently transfer\npersonal data from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the U.S.\nFurther, the exit of the UK from the EU has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK.\nThe UK has implemented legislation similar to the GDPR, referred to as the UK GDPR, which provides for fines of up\nto the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission issued an\nadequacy decision in respect of the UK’s data protection framework, allowing personal data transfers from EU member\nstates to the UK to continue without requiring additional contractual or other measures in order to lawfully transfer\npersonal data between the territories. This decision is subject to renewal after four years, however, and may be revisited\nby the European Commission at any time. In the medium and longer terms, however, the relationship between the UK\nand EU in relation to aspects of data protection law remains unclear, which exposes us to further compliance risk. The\nUK also has issued its own standard contractual clauses that are required to be implemented. We may incur liabilities,\nexpenses, costs, and other operational losses relating to the GDPR, the UK GDPR, and other laws and regulations in the\nEU and UK relating to privacy and data protection, including those of applicable EU member states in connection with\nany measures we take to comply with them.\nIn the United States, a broad variety of data protection laws and regulations may apply to our activities such as state\ndata breach notification laws, state personal data privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of\n2018 (CCPA)), state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. A range of\nenforcement agencies exist at both the state and federal levels that can enforce these laws and regulations. For example,\nthe CCPA requires covered businesses that process personal information of California residents to disclose their data\ncollection, use and sharing practices. Further, the CCPA provides California residents with certain data privacy rights\n(including the ability to opt out of certain disclosures of personal data),\n63\nTable of Contents\nimposes operational requirements for covered businesses, provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private\nright of action for data breaches and statutory damages (that is expected to increase data breach class action litigation\nand result in significant exposure to costly legal judgements and settlements). Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation\nand enforcement remain uncertain. In addition, the CCPA was expanded on January 1, 2023, when the California\nPrivacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) became operative. The CPRA, among other things, gives California residents the\nability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, establishes restrictions on the retention of personal\ninformation, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, provides for increased\npenalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establishes a new California\nPrivacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new legislation. Although there are limited exemptions for\nclinical trial data under the CCPA, the CCPA and other similar laws could impact our business activities, depending on\ntheir interpretation. Additionally, other state legislatures have enacted or are currently contemplating, and may pass,\ntheir own data privacy and security laws, with potentially greater penalties and more rigorous compliance requirements\nrelevant to our business. Many of these laws are comprehensive privacy statutes that impose obligations similar to the\nCCPA. For example, Colorado has enacted a Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) in June 2021 that went into effect on July 1,\n2023, with enforcement commencing on the same date. The Colorado Attorney General released its rules implementing\nthe CPA on March 15, 2023. Connecticut, Utah and Virginia have also enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and the\nCPA that have taken effect in 2023; Florida, Montana, Oregon and Texas have enacted similar legislation that has taken,\nor will take effect in 2024; Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nebraska and Tennessee have\nenacted similar legislation that will take effect in 2025; and Indiana, Kentucky and Rhode Island have enacted similar\nlegislation that will take effect in 2026.\nAdditionally, state and foreign laws may apply generally to the privacy and security of information we maintain,\nand may differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts and potentially requiring us to\nundertake additional measures to comply with them. With the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, CPA and other laws, regulations\nand other obligations relating to privacy and data protection imposing new and relatively burdensome obligations, and\nwith substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these and other obligations, we may face\nchallenges in addressing their requirements and in making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may\nincur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors or\nservice providers, violate applicable laws or regulations or our policies, such violations may also put our or our\ncustomers’ data at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us or\nour service providers to comply with our applicable policies or notices relating to privacy or data protection, our\ncontractual or other obligations to third parties, or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy or data\nprotection, may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims and other proceedings,\nharm our reputation, and could result in significant liability. Further, other states have enacted laws that cover certain\naspects of the collection, use, disclosure, and/or other processing of health information, such as Washington’s My\nHealth, My Data Act, which, among other things, provides for a private right of action.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key\nleadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner\nor otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely,\nwhich could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including\ngovernment budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and\nstatutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result.\nIn addition, government funding of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other government agencies\non which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the\npolitical process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including delays or disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other\npublic health emergencies, travel restrictions, staffing shortages, may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be\nreviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example,\nin 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory\n64\nTable of Contents\nagencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If any prolonged\ngovernment shutdown or disruption occurs, including due to any public health emergencies, resurgence in COVID-19\ncases, travel restrictions, or COVID-19-related policies, staffing shortages, it could significantly impact the ability of the\nFDA and other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and provide feedback on\nour clinical development plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our anticipated\ntimelines. Further, future government shutdowns or disruptions to normal operations could impact our ability to access\nthe public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nOur relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs and third-party payors in connection with our\ncurrent and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws,\ntransparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose us to\nsignificant losses, including, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from\ngovernmental healthcare programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare\nprofessionals, clinical investigators, CROs, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud\nand abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and\nrelationships through which we research, as well as market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain\nmarketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the\nfollowing:\n● the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and\nwillfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to\ninduce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or\nrecommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid;\n● the federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens\nthrough civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or\nentities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government,\nclaims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an\nobligation to pay money to the federal government;\n● the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), prohibits, among other\nthings, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false\nstatements relating to healthcare matters;\n● HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)\nand their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on\ncovered entities, which are health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers, as those\nterms are defined by HIPAA, and their respective business associates and their subcontractors, with respect to\nsafeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n● the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices,\nbiologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s\nHealth Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments\nand other transfers of value made to covered recipients, including physicians (defined to include doctors,\ndentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as\nnurse practitioners and physician assistants, among others), and teaching hospitals as well as information\nregarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians; and\n65\nTable of Contents\n● analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply\nto sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-\ngovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies\nto comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance\nregulations promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information\nrelated to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing\nexpenditures, or drug pricing; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and\nmedical representatives; state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some\ncircumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by\nHIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable\nhealthcare and data privacy laws and regulations will involve substantial ongoing costs and may require us to undertake\nor implement additional policies or measures. We may face claims and proceedings by private parties, and claims,\ninvestigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities, relating to allegations that our business practices do\nnot comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other\nhealthcare laws and regulations, and it is possible that courts or governmental authorities may conclude that we have not\ncomplied with them, or that we may find it necessary or appropriate to settle any such claims or other proceedings. In\nconnection with any such claims, proceedings, or settlements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil,\ncriminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in\ngovernment funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations,\ncontractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of\nour operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial\nand personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought\nagainst us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with\nwhom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal,\ncivil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and\nvendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and\nrequirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators,\nprincipal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities.\nMisconduct by these parties could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the\nFDA, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, accurately report financial\ninformation or data or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, research, sales, marketing and business\narrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud,\nmisconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a\nwide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other\nbusiness arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the\ncourse of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted\na code of conduct but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by these parties, and the precautions we\ntake to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in\nprotecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with\nthese laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves\nor asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of\nsignificant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment,\nexclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity\noversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and\nthe curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\n66\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or\nincur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing\nlaboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our\noperations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our\noperations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these\nmaterials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of\ncontamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting\ndamages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or\ncriminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to\ninjuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate\ncoverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that\nmay be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including\nchemicals and biological materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and\nsafety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or\ncommercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines,\npenalties or other sanctions.\nOur business activities may be subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption\nlaws of other countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws\nand regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to\nliability if we violate them.\nOur business activities are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the U.S.\ndomestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption\nlaws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit companies and their\nemployees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from, directly or indirectly,\noffering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to recipients in\nthe public or private sector in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. Our business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S.\ngovernments. Additionally, in many other countries, hospitals are owned and operated by the government, and doctors\nand other hospital employees would be considered foreign officials under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and DOJ have\nincreased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nWe sometimes leverage third parties to assist with the conduct of our business abroad. We, our employees, agents,\nrepresentatives, business partners and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with\nofficials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the\ncorrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party\nintermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees,\nagents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries will not take actions in violation of applicable\nlaw for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks\nunder these laws may increase.\nThese laws also require that we make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nof the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls and compliance\nprocedures designed to prevent violations of anti-corruption laws. There is no certainty that all of our employees,\nagents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries, or those of our affiliates, will comply with\napplicable laws and regulations, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\n67\nTable of Contents\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in whistleblower complaints, fines, severe civil or criminal\nsanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of\nexport privileges, disgorgement, and other remedial measures and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including\nour ability to offer our products in one or more countries. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in\na materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other\nprofessional fees. As a general matter, investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions could damage our reputation,\nour brand, our international activities, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating\nresults and financial condition.\nIn addition, our products may be subject to U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and\nregulations. Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required\nimport or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect\nour revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create\ndelays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products\nto some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of\ncertain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply\nwith export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or\ndenial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting\napproaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or products targeted by such\nregulations, including the impact of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration, could result in decreased\nuse of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to, existing or potential customers with\ninternational operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products\nwould likely adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Our Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers and employees.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management\npersonnel, and we face significant competition for experienced personnel. We are highly dependent on the principal\nmembers of our management and scientific and medical staff, particularly Alan Russell, our Co-Founder and Chief\nScientific Officer. Additionally, wage inflation may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel. If we do not\nsucceed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect\nour ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. In particular, the loss of one or more of our\nexecutive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. We do not\nmaintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or other employees. We could in the future have difficulty\nattracting and retaining experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our\nemployee recruitment and retention efforts.\nMany of the other biotechnology companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial\nand other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide higher\ncompensation, more diverse opportunities and better prospects for career advancement. Some of these characteristics\nmay be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and\nretain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize our product\ncandidates will be limited and the potential for successfully growing our business will be harmed.\nAdditionally, we rely on our scientific founders and other scientific and clinical advisors and consultants to assist\nus in formulating our research, development and clinical strategies. These advisors and consultants are not our\nemployees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their\navailability to us. In addition, these advisors and consultants typically will not enter into non-compete agreements with\nus. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services.\nFurthermore, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing\nproducts or technologies that may compete with ours. In particular, if we are unable to\n68\nTable of Contents\nmaintain consulting relationships with our scientific founders or if they provide services to our competitors, our\ndevelopment and commercialization efforts will be impaired and our business will be significantly harmed.\nIf we are unable to establish sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our\nproduct candidates, we may not be able to successfully sell or market our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval.\nWe currently do not have and have never had a marketing or sales team. In order to commercialize any product\ncandidates, if approved, we must build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or\nmake arrangements with third parties to perform these services for each of the territories in which we may have approval\nto sell or market our product candidates. We may not be successful in accomplishing these required tasks.\nEstablishing an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to\ncommercialize our product candidates will be expensive and time-consuming and will require significant attention of\nour executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and\ndistribution capabilities could adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain\napproval to market, if we do not have arrangements in place with third parties to provide such services on our behalf.\nAlternatively, if we choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have\ndirect sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems\nor in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems, we will be required to negotiate and enter into arrangements\nwith such third parties relating to the proposed collaboration and such arrangements may prove to be less profitable than\ncommercializing the product on our own. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed, on acceptable\nterms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory\napproval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. If we are unable to successfully\ncommercialize our approved product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third\nparties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses.\nIn order to successfully implement our plans and strategies, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may\nexperience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 108 full-time employees. Of these employees, 84 are engaged in research or\nproduct development and clinical activities. In order to successfully implement our development and commercialization\nplans and strategies, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other\npersonnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n● identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n● managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA, EMA and other comparable\nforeign regulatory agencies’ review process for sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003\ncardiometabolic discovery program and any other product candidates, while complying with any contractual\nobligations to contractors and other third parties we may have; and\n● improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to successfully develop and, if approved, commercialize\nsevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and other product\ncandidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also\nhave to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial\namount of time to managing these growth activities.\n69\nTable of Contents\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent\norganizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including key aspects of our research and\ndevelopment, clinical development and manufacturing. We cannot assure you that the services of independent\norganizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can\nfind qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality\nor accuracy of the services provided by third-party service providers is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials\nmay be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of sevasemten, EDG-\n7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and any other product candidates or\notherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our existing third-party service\nproviders or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and/or engaging additional third-\nparty service providers, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and\ncommercialize sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and\nother product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nOur computer systems, or those of any of our CROs, manufacturers, other contractors or consultants or potential future\ncollaborators, may fail or suffer security or data privacy breaches or incidents or other unauthorized or improper access to, use\nof, or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or personal data, which could result in additional costs,\nloss of revenue, significant liabilities, harm to our brand and material disruption of our operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures in an effort to protect systems that store our information, given\ntheir size and complexity and the increasing amounts of information maintained on our internal information technology\nsystems, and those of our third-party CROs, other contractors (including sites performing our clinical trials) and\nconsultants, these systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other damage or interruption from service\ninterruptions, system malfunction, technical errors, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and\nelectrical failures, as well as security breaches and incidents from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees,\ncontractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties\n(including supply chain cyber-attacks or the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks,\nsocial engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability\nof information), which may compromise our system infrastructure or availability or lead to the loss, destruction,\nalteration, prevention of access to, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data\n(including trade secrets or other confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information, and\npersonal information) or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets, which could result in\nfinancial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, in 2019, one of our CROs experienced a\ncybersecurity breach which resulted in unauthorized access to certain of our preclinical data. Additionally, in 2023, one\nof our CROs experienced a cyber-attack for which an investigation found that no unauthorized access to Edgewise data\noccurred in connection with this event. We have received phishing attacks, and companies have, in general, experienced\nan increase in phishing and social engineering attacks from third parties in connection with remote working, which has\nincreased these and other cybersecurity risks. Additionally, cybersecurity researchers have warned of heightened risks of\ncyberattacks in connection with Russia’s war with Ukraine, and war and instability in Israel and the surrounding region.\nAny disruption or security incident resulting in any loss, destruction, unavailability, alteration, disclosure, disruption or\ndissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our applications, any other data processed or maintained on our\nbehalf or other assets, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, could cause us to incur costs,\nliability, and other financial harm and reputational damage and could contribute to delays in the development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment\nin information technology, or the efforts or investments of CROs, consultants or other third parties, will prevent\nsignificant breakdowns in systems or will prevent, or have prevented, other cyber incidents that could disrupt our\nprograms and operations and the development of our product candidates or result in loss, destruction, unavailability,\nalteration or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our systems and data and other data processed or\nmaintained on our behalf or other assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon\n70\nTable of Contents\nour reputation, business, operations or financial condition. Any such event that leads to loss, damage, or unauthorized\naccess to, or use, alteration, or disclosure, dissemination, or other processing of, personal information, including\npersonal information regarding our clinical trial subjects or employees, or the perception that any such event has\noccurred, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and\nforeign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, cause us to incur costs, and otherwise subject us to\nliability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in\nsignificant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nNotifications and follow-up actions related to a security breach or incident could impact our reputation and cause us\nto incur significant costs, including legal expenses and remediation costs. For example, the loss, corruption or\n(temporary or permanent) unavailability of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in\ndelays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the impacted data.\nWe expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security breaches and incidents, and we may face\nincreased costs and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach\nor incident. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and for other purposes, and similar\nevents relating to their infrastructure and systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such\ndisruption in or, failure or security breach or incident of or impacting our systems or third-party systems where\ninformation important to our business operations or commercial development is stored. In addition, such insurance may\nnot be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all\nclaims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could\nbe costly and divert management attention.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist activity,\npandemics and other events beyond our control, which could harm our business.\nOur facilities are located in Boulder, Colorado. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential\nconsequences to our business and financial results from a major flood, blizzard, fire, earthquake, power loss, terrorist\nactivity, pandemics or other disasters and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, we do not carry\nsufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses from interruption of our business that may occur, and any losses\nor damages incurred by us could harm our business. Also, our contract development and manufacturing organizations’\n(CDMOs) and suppliers’ facilities are located in multiple locations where other natural disasters or similar events which\ncould severely disrupt our operations, could expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial\ncondition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations\ndirectly or indirectly. A variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with business operations we conduct internationally, as well as indirect\nimpacts from our relationships with collaborators, partners, or contractors who conduct business internationally. We may\nseek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will\nbe subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n● differing regulatory requirements and reimbursement regimes in foreign countries, including changes in\nexisting regulatory requirements and implementation of new regulatory requirements or policies that impact our\nclinical development and business operations in foreign countries;\n71\nTable of Contents\n● foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of our clinical trials or\nour interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● approval policies or regulations of foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner\nrendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n● unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n● economic weakness, including inflation, change in political condition, including as a result of the upcoming\nchange in the U.S. presidential administration, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n● compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n● foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n● foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and\nother obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n● difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n● workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n● potential liability under the FCPA or comparable foreign regulations;\n● challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that\ndo not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n● impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health concerns on our ability to produce our product\ncandidates and conduct clinical trials in foreign countries;\n● production or supply shortages or other disruptions resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or\nmanufacturing capabilities abroad, including, but not limited to, impacts due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia\nwar, addition of certain suppliers or companies to the Unverified List or other export restrictions under the\nExport Administration Regulations, implementation of other export controls, restrictions or sanctions, including\nimpact of the upcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration, that can impact the supply chain, our\nbusiness, or business operations of our suppliers, contractors or partners; and\n● business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine\nand war and instability in Israel and the surrounding region, other regional or geo-political conflicts, and\nterrorism.\nIn particular, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and\nvarious other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other\nlimitations on cross-border operations. The U.S. government has and continues to make significant additional changes in\nU.S. trade policy and may continue to take future actions, including the impact of the upcoming change in the U.S.\npresidential administration, that could negatively impact U.S. trade. For example, legislation has been introduced in\nCongress to limit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by\nselect Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing executive branch\nauthorities to limit those Chinese service providers’ ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what\nactions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United\n72\nTable of Contents\nStates and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what actions may be\ntaken by the other countries in retaliation. If we are unable to obtain or use services from existing service providers or\nbecome unable to export or sell our products to any of our customers or service providers, our business, liquidity,\nfinancial condition, and/or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to\nattain or maintain profitable operations.\nInflation in the global economy could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nGeneral inflation in the United States, Europe and other geographies has risen to levels not experienced in recent\ndecades. General inflation, including rising prices for our trial drug supply, CROs, CDMOs and rising salaries\nnegatively impact our business by increasing our operating expenses. To the extent general inflation results in rising\ninterest rates and has other adverse effects on the market, it may continue to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret\nprotection for our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses as well as our ability to operate without\ninfringing upon the proprietary rights of others. We generally seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent\napplications in the United States and abroad related to our product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses\nthat are important to our business. We also seek to protect our proprietary position by acquiring or in-licensing relevant\nissued patents or pending applications from third parties.\nPending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such\napplications unless, and until, patents issue from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover\nthe technology. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or the patent applications of any licensor will\nresult in additional patents being issued or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with\nsimilar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or\ninvalidated by third parties.\nEven issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings\ninstituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for our and any\nlicensor’s proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our\nrights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. These uncertainties and/or limitations in our ability to\nproperly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that the claims in our U.S. pending patent applications, corresponding international patent\napplications and patent applications in certain foreign territories, or that of any licensor, will be considered patentable\nby the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), courts in the United States or by the patent offices and\ncourts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that issued claims will not be found invalid or unenforceable if\nchallenged.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we\nor any of our potential future collaborators will be successful in protecting our product candidates by obtaining and\ndefending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n● the USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural,\ndocumentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process, the noncompliance\n73\nTable of Contents\nwith which can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, and partial or complete loss of\npatent rights in the relevant jurisdiction;\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n● patents may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable or\notherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n● our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made\nsignificant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will\nlimit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our potential product candidates;\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the\nscope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove\nsuccessful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by\nU.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product\ncandidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is also expensive and time-consuming, and we and any licensor may not be able to\nfile and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all\njurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we or any licensor will fail to\nidentify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nIn addition, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to\npatentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators,\nCROs, third-party manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach such\nagreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent\nprotection.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates,\npatents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result,\nour intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products\nsimilar or identical to ours.\nIf the scope of any patent protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to\nprevent our competitors from commercializing similar or identical product candidates would be adversely affected.\nThe patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and\nfactual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity,\nenforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent\napplications and those of any licensor may not result in patents being issued which protect our product candidates or\nwhich effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive product candidates.\nMoreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and\nits scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we own or in-license currently or in the future\nissue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors\nor other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that\nwe own or in-license may be challenged or circumvented by third parties or may be narrowed or invalidated as a result\nof challenges by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether our\n74\nTable of Contents\nproduct candidates will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other\nthird parties may be able to circumvent our patents or the patents of any licensors by developing similar or alternative\ntechnologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents or\nthe patents of any licensor may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be\nsubject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation,\nrevocation, reexamination, post-grant review (PGR) and inter partes review (IPR), or other similar proceedings\nchallenging our owned patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could\nreduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our\nproduct candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or\ncommercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, our patents or the patents of any licensor\nmay become subject to post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge\nour priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our patents and patent applications and those of\nany licensor. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed,\ninvalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or\nidentical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. Such\nproceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if\nthe eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and\npatent applications or the patents and patent applications of any licensor is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it\ncould dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product\ncandidates.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property\nrights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage.\nFor example:\n● others may be able to develop products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the\nclaims of the patents that we own or license;\n● we or any licensor or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the patent\napplications that we own or license;\n● we or any licensor or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of\nour inventions;\n● others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies\nwithout infringing our intellectual property rights;\n● it is possible that the pending patent applications we own or license will not lead to issued patents;\n● our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent\nrights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our\nmajor commercial markets;\n● we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n● the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n75\nTable of Contents\n● we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third-party may\nsubsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, it could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary\nrights of third parties. Claims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or\nprevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third\nparties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe\nor otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Other entities may\nhave or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our\nproduct candidates and products that may be approved in the future, or impair our competitive position. There is a\nsubstantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual\nproperty rights in the biopharmaceutical industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, oppositions, reexaminations,\nIPR proceedings and PGR proceedings before the USPTO and/or corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous third-\nparty U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications exist in the fields in which we are developing\nproduct candidates. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations,\nmethods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates.\nThere are numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third-parties in the\nfields in which we are developing our product candidates. Because patent applications are maintained as confidential for\na certain period of time, until the relevant application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may\nbe infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates, and we cannot be certain that we were the first to\nfile a patent application related to a product candidate or technology. Moreover, because patent applications can take\nmany years to issue, there may be currently-pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our\nproduct candidates may infringe. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our\ntechnology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents,\nincomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. There is also no assurance that there\nis not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe is relevant to our business, which may, nonetheless,\nultimately be found to limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our products that may be approved in\nthe future, or impair our competitive position. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that\nuse of our technologies infringes upon these patents. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would\nbe time consuming and could:\n● result in costly litigation that may cause negative publicity;\n● divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n● cause development delays;\n● prevent us from commercializing any of our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held\nfinally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n● require us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n● subject us to significant liability to third parties; or\n● require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all, or which might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining\naccess to the same technology.\n76\nTable of Contents\nAlthough no third-party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this periodic report,\nothers may hold proprietary rights that could prevent our product candidates from being marketed. For example, we are\naware of an issued patent that claims a method of treatment based upon a general mode of action. These claims could be\nalleged to cover sevasemten in certain treatment indications. While we believe that these patents are difficult to enforce\nand that we would have valid defenses to these claims of patent infringement, we cannot be certain that we would\nprevail in any dispute and we cannot be certain how an adverse determination would affect our business.\nIt is possible that a third party may assert a claim of patent infringement directed at any of our product candidates.\nAny patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our\nproducts, treatment indications, or processes could subject us to significant liability for damages, including treble\ndamages if we were determined to willfully infringe, and require us to obtain a license to manufacture or market our\nproduct candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and\nwould be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail\nin any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially\nacceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, even if we or our future strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights\nmay be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. In addition,\nwe cannot be certain that we could redesign our product candidates, treatment indications, or processes to avoid\ninfringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our product candidates,\nwhich could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, intellectual property litigation,\nregardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us from marketing or otherwise\ncommercializing our product candidates and technology.\nParties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than\nwe can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery\nrequired in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our\nconfidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation\nand continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may in the future pursue invalidity proceedings with respect to third-party patents. The outcome following legal\nassertions of invalidity is unpredictable. Even if resolved in our favor, these legal proceedings may cause us to incur\nsignificant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In\naddition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or\ndevelopments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial\nadverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and\nreduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We\nmay not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such proceedings adequately. Some of these third parties\nmay be able to sustain the costs of such proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial\nresources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent proceedings could compromise our\nability to compete in the marketplace. If we do not prevail in the patent proceedings the third parties may assert a claim\nof patent infringement directed at our product candidates.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-\nlicenses.\nMany pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions may have patents and patent\napplications potentially relevant to our business. We may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses to such patents\nfrom such third-party intellectual property holders, for example, in order to avoid infringing these third-party patents.\nWe may also require licenses from third parties for certain technologies for use with future product candidates. We may\nbe unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or\n77\nTable of Contents\nother third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates.\nThe licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more\nestablished companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may\nconsider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their\nsize, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that\nperceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or\nacquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our\ninvestment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or\nmaintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program\nor product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or any licensor’s patents, which could be expensive, time\nconsuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents or any licensor’s patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if\nchallenged in court.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property rights. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we may be\nrequired to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in a patent infringement\nproceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own or in-license is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed.\nIf we or any of our potential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a\npatent directed at one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent or the patent of any\nlicensor is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant\ncounterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an\nalleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, lack of sufficient\nwritten description, non-enablement, or obviousness-type double patenting. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion\ncould include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from\nthe USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution.\nThird parties may also raise similar invalidity claims before the USPTO or patent offices abroad, even outside the\ncontext of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, PGR, IPR, derivation proceedings, and equivalent\nproceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity\nand/or unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that\nthere is no invalidating prior art, of which we, any licensor, and the patent examiners are unaware during prosecution.\nThere is also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the\nvalidity or enforceability of a claim in our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of any\nlicensor, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. If a third-party\nwere to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the\npatent protection on our technology or proprietary drug discovery platform, or any product candidates that we may\ndevelop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications or the patents\nand patent applications of any licensor is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license,\ndevelop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may\ncause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim\nproceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a\nsubstantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase\nour operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or\ndistribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings\nadequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively\nthan we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of\npatent litigation or other proceedings could\n78\nTable of Contents\ncompromise our ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery\nrequired in connection with intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property\nrights, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of\nlitigation or other proceedings.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may\nhave blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented\ntechnology.\nIn Europe, as of June 1, 2023, European applications and patents may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Unified\nPatent Court (UPC). Also, European applications now have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent\nwhich is subject to the jurisdiction of the UPC. This may be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a\nnew court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. As a single court system can\ninvalidate a European patent, we, where applicable may opt out of the UPC, and as such, each European patent would need to\nbe challenged in each individual country.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our\ncommon shares to decline.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of\nthe litigation as well as results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If\nsecurities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our existing products,\nprograms or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of shares of our common stock\nmay decline. Such announcements could also harm our reputation or the market for our future products, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nDerivation proceedings may be necessary to determine priority of inventions, and an unfavorable outcome may require us to\ncease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party.\nDerivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to\ndetermine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of any licensor. An\nunfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the\nprevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially\nreasonable terms. Our defense of derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs\nand distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with such proceedings could\nhave a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our\nresearch programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development or manufacturing\npartnerships that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law, or laws in other countries, could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our\nability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property,\nparticularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve a high degree of\ntechnological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming\nand inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States\nand other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may increase the uncertainties and costs\nsurrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict\nthe breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. In addition, Congress or\nother foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us.\nFor example, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope\nof patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In\naddition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this\n79\nTable of Contents\ncombination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on\ndecisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the\nlaws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new\npatents or to enforce our existing patent and the patents we might obtain or license in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees or other third parties have an ownership interest in our\npatents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging\ninventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may\nlose valuable intellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if\nwe are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distraction to\nmanagement and other employees.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration\nof a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available,\nbut the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are\nobtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount\nof time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such\ncandidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may\nnot provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or\nmore of our U.S. patents or those of any licensor may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price\nCompetition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Amendments). The Hatch- Waxman Amendments\npermit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and\nthe FDA regulatory review process. A maximum of one patent may be extended per FDA approved product as\ncompensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend\nthe remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims\ncovering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent\nterm extension may also be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nHowever, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines,\nfailing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover,\nthe applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to\nobtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors\nmay obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly\nmaterially. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by\nreferencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive,\nand our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the\nUnited States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same\nextent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from\npracticing our inventions in all countries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our\ninventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may\n80\nTable of Contents\nuse our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and,\nfurther, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not\nas strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents, the\npatents of any licensors, or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from\ncompeting.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in\nforeign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many foreign countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or any future\nlicensors’ patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our\npatent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other\naspects of our business, could put our patents or the patents of any licensors at risk of being invalidated or interpreted\nnarrowly and our patent applications or the patent applications of any licensor at risk of not issuing and could provoke\nthird parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other\nremedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual\nproperty that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to\nthird parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government\ncontractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value\nof such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our\ncompetitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be\nadversely affected.\nGeo-political actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding\nthe prosecution or maintenance of our patent applications or those of any current or future licensors and the maintenance,\nenforcement or defense of our issued patents or those of any current or future licensors. For example, the United States and\nforeign government actions related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which could be subject to change as a result of the\nupcoming change in the U.S. presidential administration, may limit or prevent filing, prosecution and maintenance of patent\napplications in Russia. Government actions may also prevent maintenance of issued patents in Russia. These actions could\nresult in abandonment or lapse of our patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in\nRussia. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a decree was\nadopted by the Russian government in March 2022, allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned\nby patentees that have citizenship or nationality in, are registered in, or have predominately primary place of business or\nprofit-making activities in the United States and other countries that Russia has deemed unfriendly without consent or\ncompensation. Consequently, we would not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from\nselling or importing products made using our inventions in and into Russia. Accordingly, our competitive position may be\nimpaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn Europe, as of June 1, 2023, European applications and patents may be subjected to the jurisdiction of the Unified\nPatent Court (UPC). Also, European applications now have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent\nwhich is subject to the jurisdiction of the UPC. This may be a significant change in European patent practice. As the UPC is a\nnew court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. As a single court system can\ninvalidate a European patent, we, where applicable may opt out of the UPC, and as such, each European patent would need to\nbe challenged in each individual country.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment\nand other requirements imposed by regulations and governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or\neliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or\napplications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our\n81\nTable of Contents\npatents and/or applications and those of any licensors. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we\nrely on our outside patent annuity service to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign\npatent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions\nduring the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in\nmany cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules\napplicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in\nabandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the\nrelevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our\nmarkets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to use registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names to brand and market ourselves and our\nproducts. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined\nto be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we\nneed to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors\nmay adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought\nby owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered\ntrademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks\nand trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. Our\nefforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or\nother intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could\nadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other\nproprietary information to maintain our competitive position. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets\nand unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential\ninformation and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that\nall such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our\nproprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and\ntime-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less\nwilling or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information\nindependently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with\nus. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets, the value of this information\nmay be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to\nsuch publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other\nconfidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be\njeopardized.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or\ntrade secrets.\nWe have entered into and may enter in the future into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect the\nproprietary positions of third parties, such as outside scientific collaborators, CROs, third-party manufacturers,\nconsultants, advisors, potential partners, lessees of shared multi-company property and other third parties. We may\nbecome subject to litigation where a third-party asserts that we or our employees inadvertently or otherwise\n82\nTable of Contents\nbreached the agreements and used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to the third parties.\nDefense of such matters, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and be a substantial\ndiversion of employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions.\nMoreover, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us\nfrom marketing or otherwise commercializing our product candidates and technology. Failure to defend against any such\nclaim could subject us to significant liability for monetary damages or prevent or delay our developmental and\ncommercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in defending against\nthese claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team and other\nemployees.\nParties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more\neffectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial\namount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our\nconfidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation\nand continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have\nwrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to our employees, we engage the services of consultants\nto assist us in the development of our product candidates. Many of these consultants, and many of our employees, were\npreviously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to, other\npharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that\nwe, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other information\nproprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against\nthese claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable\nintellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in\ndefending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team\nand other employees.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates may be subject, in part, to the terms and\nconditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe may enter into license agreements in the future to advance our research or allow commercialization of product\ncandidates. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in\nall relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and\nproducts in the future.\nIn addition, subject to the terms of any such license agreements, we may not have the right to control the\npreparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of patents and patent applications covering the\ntechnology that we license from third parties. In such an event, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent\napplications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced, and defended in a manner consistent with the best\ninterests of our business. If any licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and defend such patents, or lose rights to\nthose patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our right to develop\nand commercialize any of our products that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nAny licensor may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that\nany licensor are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership\nrights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could\nmarket competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position,\nbusiness, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n83\nTable of Contents\nIt is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at\nall. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same\ntechnologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our\ntechnology, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology,\nall of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to\ndevelop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which\nmight be enforced against our current technology, manufacturing methods, product candidates, or future methods or\nproducts resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or future sales, or, with respect to our future sales,\nan obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be\nsignificant.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third\nparties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with any licensors, we could lose license rights that are\nimportant to our business.\nDisputes may arise between us and future licensors or potential licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a\nlicense agreement, including:\n● the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n● whether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor\nthat is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n● our right to sublicense patents and other rights to third parties;\n● our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n● our right to transfer or assign the license;\n● the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of\nintellectual property by any licensors and us and our partners; and\n● the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are\ncomplex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any\ncontract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the\nrelevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under\nthe relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our\nability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to\nsuccessfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn spite of our best efforts, any licensor or potential licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our\nlicense agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to develop and\ncommercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if\nthe underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory\napproval of, and to market, products identical to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive\nposition, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates may be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents\nrelating to our product candidates, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for patents relating to\nour product candidates are controlled by any licensors or collaboration partners. If any licensors or collaboration\npartners fail to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best\ninterests of our business, including by payment of all applicable fees for patents covering our product candidates, we\ncould lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, our ability to develop and\ncommercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from\nmaking, using and selling competing products. In addition, even where we have the right to control patent prosecution\nof patents and patent applications we have licensed to and from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or\nprejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensees, any licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date upon\nwhich we assumed control over patent prosecution.\nIntellectual property discovered through government funded programs may be subject to federal regulations such as “march-in”\nrights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for U.S.-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit\nour exclusive rights and limit our ability to contract with non-U.S. manufacturers.\nWe have in-licensed patent applications that were generated through the use of U.S. government funding or grants,\nand may acquire or license in the future intellectual property rights that have been generated through the use of U.S.\ngovernment funding or grants. Pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, the U.S. government has certain rights in\ninventions developed with government funding. These U.S. government rights include a non-exclusive, non-\ntransferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S.\ngovernment has the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or\nnon-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third-party if it determines that: (1) adequate steps have not been\ntaken to commercialize the invention; (2) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or\n(3) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (also referred to as\n“march-in rights”). If the U.S. government exercised its march-in rights in our future intellectual property rights that are\ngenerated through the use of U.S. government funding or grants, we could be forced to license or sublicense intellectual\nproperty developed by us or that we license on terms unfavorable to us, and there can be no assurance that we would\nreceive compensation from the U.S. government for the exercise of such rights. The U.S. government also has the right\nto take title to these inventions if the grant recipient fails to disclose the invention to the government or fails to file an\napplication to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a\ngovernment funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to\nexpend substantial resources. In addition, the U.S. government requires that any products embodying any of these\ninventions or produced through the use of any of these inventions be manufactured substantially in the United States.\nThis preference for U.S. industry may be waived by the federal agency that provided the funding if the owner or\nassignee of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses\non similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that\nunder the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for U.S. industry may limit\nour ability to contract with non-U.S. product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform\nsatisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research and studies, which may harm our\nbusiness.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our clinical trials. We currently rely on third parties, such as\nCROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct our current\nand planned clinical trials of sevasemten and EDG-7500 and we expect to continue to rely upon third parties to conduct\nadditional clinical trials for sevasemten, EDG-7500 and other product candidates. Third parties have a significant role in\nthe conduct of our clinical trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not our\nemployees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third\n85\nTable of Contents\nparties, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that any such third-party will devote to our\nclinical trials. The third parties we rely on for these services may also have relationships with other entities, some of\nwhich may be our competitors. Some of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we\nneed to enter into alternative arrangements with a third-party, it would delay our drug development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for such drug development activities will reduce our control over these activities\nbut will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each\nof our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial.\nMoreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GCP standards, regulations for conducting, recording and reporting the\nresults of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are reliable and accurate and that the rights, integrity and\nconfidentiality of trial participants are protected. The EMA also requires us to comply with similar standards.\nRegulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal\ninvestigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data\ngenerated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory\nauthorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot\nassure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our\nclinical trials substantially comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product\nproduced under current cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical\ntrials, which would delay the marketing approval process.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our\nclinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may\nbe delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in\nour efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe also expect to rely on third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance\nfailure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates\nor commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe contract with third parties for the production of sevasemten and EDG-7500 for our ongoing clinical trials and the\nproduction of product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program for our ongoing preclinical studies, and\nexpect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials, preclinical studies and ultimately for commercialization. This reliance on\nthird parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quality and quantities of our product candidates or such quantities\nat an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates\nfor use in development and commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for\nthe production of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of our\norganization. We will be relying on a single third-party manufacturer and we currently have no alternative manufacturer\nin place. Changing our third-party manufacturer could result in delays in our manufacturing supply chain which could\ndelay or otherwise impact our development of sevasemten, EDG-7500, and product candidates from our EDG-003\ncardiometabolic discovery program and result in increased costs related to sevasemten, EDG-7500, and product candidates\nfrom our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program. We do not have long-term supply agreements, and we purchase\nour required drug product on a purchase order basis, which means that aside from any binding purchase orders we have\nfrom time to time, our supplier could cease supplying to us or change the terms on which it is willing to continue\nsupplying to us at any time. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of sevasemten, EDG-7500, product\ncandidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program or any other product candidates for any reason, whether\nas a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions\nor terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials and preclinical studies.\n86\nTable of Contents\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product\ncandidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements\nwith third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-\nparty manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n● the failure of the third-party to manufacture our product candidates according to our schedule and\nspecifications, or at all, including if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other\nproducts over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the\nagreements between us and them;\n● the termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is\ncostly or inconvenient for us;\n● the breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\n● the failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including cGMPs;\n● the failure of the third-party to manufacture our product candidates according to our specifications;\n● the mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active\ndrug or placebo not being properly identified;\n● clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug\nsupplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\n● the misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of our CDMOs and are dependent\non these CDMOs for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active pharmaceutical ingredients\n(API) and finished drug products. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product\ncandidates and intend to put in place framework agreements under which CDMOs will generally provide us with\nnecessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. As we\nadvance our product candidates through development, we will consider our lack of redundant supply for the API and\ndrug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions. However, we may be\nunsuccessful in putting in place such framework agreements or protecting against potential supply disruptions.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements\noutside of the United States. If our CDMOs cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our\nspecifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or\nmaintain marketing approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of\nour CDMOs to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA, EMA or a\ncomparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates\nor if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we will need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, and those\nnew facilities would need to be inspected and approved by FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authority prior to\ncommencing manufacturing, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or\nmarket our product candidates, if approved. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with\napplicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays,\nsuspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating\nrestrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product\ncandidates or drugs and harm our business and results of operations.\n87\nTable of Contents\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may\nadversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive\nmarketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nOur reliance on third parties may require us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will\ndiscover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we currently rely on third parties in the course of our business, we may share our proprietary technology\nand confidential information, including trade secrets, with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology, in part,\nby entering into confidentiality agreements, and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, collaborative research\nagreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and\nconsultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights\nof the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information. Despite the contractual provisions employed when\nworking with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such\ntrade secrets become known by our competitors, are intentionally or inadvertently incorporated into the technology of\nothers or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on\nour know-how and trade secrets and despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, a competitor’s discovery of our\nproprietary technology and confidential information or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our\ncompetitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand prospects.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders,\ncause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate various acquisition opportunities and strategic partnerships, including licensing or\nacquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies or businesses. Any potential acquisition or\nstrategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n● increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n● the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n● the issuance of our equity securities;\n● assimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties\nassociated with integrating new personnel;\n● the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing programs and initiatives in pursuing such a\nstrategic merger or acquisition;\n● retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business\nrelationships;\n● risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that\nparty and their existing products or product candidates and marketing approvals; and\n● our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in\nundertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions or pursue partnerships in the future, we may issue dilutive securities,\nassume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in\nsignificant future amortization expense.\n88\nTable of Contents\nIf we decide to establish collaborations, but are not able to establish those collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we\nmay have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require\nsubstantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may seek to selectively form collaborations to expand our capabilities,\npotentially accelerate research and development activities and provide for commercialization activities by third parties.\nIn addition, we intend to explore strategic partnering and collaboration opportunities to out-license rights to our research\nprograms and drug candidates for indications in which we are unlikely to pursue development and commercialization. In\nparallel, we will also evaluate select external opportunities to strategically expand our portfolio. Any of these\nrelationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures,\nissue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business.\nWe would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-\nconsuming and complex. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things,\nupon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed\ncollaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or\nresults of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the\npotential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such\nproduct candidate to patients, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our\nownership of intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The potential collaborator may also\nconsider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on\nand whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Further, we may\nnot be successful in our efforts to establish a collaboration or other alternative arrangements for product candidates\nbecause they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may\nnot view them as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nIn addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical\ncompanies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we are successful in entering\ninto a collaboration, the terms and conditions of that collaboration may restrict us from entering into future agreements\non certain terms with potential collaborators.\nIf and when we seek to enter into collaborations, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis,\non acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate,\nreduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential\ncommercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake\ndevelopment or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund\ndevelopment or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be\navailable to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop\nour product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If those\ncollaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nIf we enter into any collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the\namount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product\ncandidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ abilities and\nefforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Collaborations involving our\nproduct candidates would pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n● collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to, and the\nmanner in which they perform their obligations under, these collaborations and may not perform their\nobligations as expected;\n89\nTable of Contents\n● collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or\nmay elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results,\nchanges in the collaborators’ strategic focus, including as a result of a business combination or sale or\ndisposition of a business unit or development function, or available funding or external factors such as an\nacquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n● collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical\ntrial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a\nproduct candidate for clinical testing;\n● collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or\nindirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to\nbe successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than\nours;\n● a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources\nto the marketing and distribution of our product relative to other products;\n● we may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n● collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights or may use\nour proprietary information and intellectual property in such a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual\nproperty related proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information and intellectual\nproperty or expose us to potential litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings;\n● disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research,\ndevelopment or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that\ndiverts management attention and resources;\n● collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue\nfurther development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n● collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most\nefficient manner or at all;\n● collaborators may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding development progress and\nactivities under the collaboration or may limit our ability to share such information, which could adversely\nimpact our ability to report progress to our investors and otherwise plan our own development of our product\ncandidates;\n● collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our\ncollaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize\nsuch intellectual property; and\n● a collaborator’s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable\nlaws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nWe also collaborate with a network of experts who advise and support our development efforts. In the future, such\nexperts may not collaborate with us which could affect our ability to develop our product candidates and proprietary\ndrug discovery platform as such experts potentially provide us with access to ideas to address the needs of muscle\ndiseases.\n90\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market may not continue to be developed or sustained for our common stock and as a result\nit may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nPrior to our initial public offering (IPO), no market for shares of our common stock existed. The trading market for\nour common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market was previously limited and an active trading market for our\nshares may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares.\nFurthermore, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and\nmay impair our ability to enter into strategic collaborations or acquire companies, technologies or other assets by using\nour shares of common stock as consideration.\nThe price of our stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide\nfluctuations in response to various factors, some of which we cannot control. The stock market in general, and\npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that\nhave often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nBroad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our\nactual operating performance. In addition to the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this\nperiodic report, these factors include:\n● the timing and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, those conducted by\nthird parties or those of our competitors;\n● the success of competitive products or announcements by potential competitors of their product development\nefforts;\n● regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors’ products;\n● actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n● regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n● developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n● the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n● announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures,\ncollaborations or capital commitments;\n● actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by\nsecurities analysts;\n● fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n● market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector;\n● changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n● share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n91\nTable of Contents\n● announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n● sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n● the impact of any natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n● general economic, political, industry and market conditions including the impact of the change in the U.S.\npresidential administration and the impact of increasing inflation.\nThe realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this\n“Risk Factors” section, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause\nour operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us\nto predict our future operating results. From time to time, we may enter into license or collaboration agreements or\nstrategic partnerships with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone\npayments and/or royalties, which may become an important source of our revenue. These upfront and milestone\npayments may vary significantly from period to period and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our\noperating results from one period to the next.\nIn addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the\naward, based on the fair value of the award as determined by our board of directors, and recognize the cost as an\nexpense over the employee’s requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards\nchange over time, including our underlying stock price and stock price volatility, the magnitude of the expense that we\nmust recognize may vary significantly.\nFurthermore, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our\ncontrol and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\n● the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our current\nproduct candidates and any future product candidates and research-stage programs, which will change from\ntime to time;\n● our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials and the timing of enrollment;\n● the cost of manufacturing our current product candidates and any future product candidates, which may vary\ndepending on FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority guidelines and requirements, the\nquantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;\n● expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies or\nother assets;\n● the timing and outcomes of clinical trials or preclinical studies (as applicable) for sevasemten, EDG-7500, and\nour EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and any of our other product candidates, or competing\nproduct candidates;\n● the need to conduct unanticipated clinical trials or trials that are larger or more complex than anticipated;\n● competition from existing and potential future products that compete with sevasemten, EDG-7500, product\ncandidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic discovery program and any of our other product candidates\n92\nTable of Contents\nor programs, and changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our\ncompetitors or partners;\n● any delays in regulatory review or approval of sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003\ncardiometabolic discovery program or any of our other product candidates;\n● the level of demand for sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic\ndiscovery program and any of our other product candidates, if approved, which may fluctuate significantly and\nbe difficult to predict;\n● the risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to our product candidates, if approved,\nand existing and potential future products that compete with sevasemten and any of our other product\ncandidates;\n● our ability to commercialize sevasemten, EDG-7500, product candidates from our EDG-003 cardiometabolic\ndiscovery program and any of our other product candidates, if approved, inside and outside of the United\nStates, either independently or working with third parties;\n● our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\n● our ability to adequately support future growth;\n● potential unforeseen business disruptions that increase our costs or expenses;\n● future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;\n● the changing and volatile global economic and political environment, including as a result of the upcoming\nchange in the U.S. presidential administration; and\n● increased impact from COVID-19 on the costs and timing associated with the conduct of our clinical trial and\nother related business activities.\nThe cumulative effect of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and\nannual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful.\nInvestors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and\nunpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for\nany period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts\nwe may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or\ninvestors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when\nwe have met any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide.\nOur affiliated principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert\nsignificant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our executive officers, directors, affiliated holders of 5% or more of our capital stock\nand their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 22.7% of our outstanding common stock. These\nstockholders, acting together, may be able to control matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be\nable to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of\nassets or other major corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership control may delay, discourage or prevent a\nchange of control, including unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in\nyour best interest as one of our stockholders, entrench our management and board of directors or delay or prevent a\nmerger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire. The\ninterests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your\n93\nTable of Contents\ninterests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not\nnecessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the\nprevailing market price for our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. On May\n10, 2024, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR that allows us to undertake various equity\nand debt offerings and entered into the Leerink Sales Agreement under which we may offer and sell shares of common\nstock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $175,000,000 from time to time, through the Leerink ATM.\nMoreover, certain holders of our common stock have rights, subject to conditions, to require us to file registration\nstatements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or\nother stockholders. Registration of these shares, under the Securities Act, would result in the shares becoming freely\ntradeable in the public market, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates. In addition, shares\nregistered under Form S-8 to register shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our equity compensation\nplans become available for sale in the public market subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting arrangements and\nthe exercise of such options and, in the case of our affiliates, the restrictions of Rule 144. If any of these shares are sold,\nor if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. If\nour stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amount of our common\nstock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe are currently an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced\nreporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our common stock\nless attractive to investors.\nWe are currently an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012\n(JOBS Act). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of exemptions\nfrom various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth\ncompanies, including:\n● being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited\ninterim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in our periodic reports;\n● not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, as amended (Sarbanes-Oxley Act);\n● not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing\nadditional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n● reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\nand\n● exemptions from the requirements of holding nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive\ncompensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards\nuntil such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from\nnew or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards\nas other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial\n94\nTable of Contents\nstatements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of\npublic company effective dates.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions.\nIf some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our\ncommon stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company until December 31, 2024. We will\ntransition to a “large accelerated filer” status with effect as of January 1, 2025, because the aggregate market value of\nour common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of June 30, 2024. As a large accelerated filer, we will\nhave to provide more expansive disclosure regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and be subject to\nshorter filing deadlines, which will require additional time and expense. We will also be required to comply with the\nauditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or if they publish adverse or misleading research or reports,\nregarding us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry\nanalysts publish about us, our business or our market. We currently have research coverage from a limited number of\nsecurities or industry analysts. If no or few new securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the stock price\nmay be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who cover us issue adverse or misleading research or reports\nregarding us, our business model, our intellectual property, our stock performance or our market, or if our operating\nresults fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts\ncease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in\nturn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAdditionally, if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on\na timely basis could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We are\nsubject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform\nand Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC\n(Nasdaq). Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nMoreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and makes\nsome activities more time-consuming and costly, which has increased our operating expenses. For example, these rules\nand regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we\nhave been required to incur substantial costs to maintain sufficient coverage, particularly in light of recent cost increases\nrelated to coverage. We cannot accurately predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to\nrespond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and\nretain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, we are required to incur additional costs and obligations in order to comply with SEC rules that\nimplement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, as a result of our ceasing to be an emerging growth company\nand being deemed a large accelerated filer as of January 1, 2025, commencing with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe year ending December 31, 2024, we will be required to include an attestation report on internal control over\nfinancial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section\n404 within the prescribed period, we have engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal\nresources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of\nour internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate\nthrough testing that controls are designed and operating\n95\nTable of Contents\neffectively, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial\nreporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed\nstandards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or\ndeficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nOur internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s\nobjectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud\nwill be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we are unable to\nmaintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements.\nIf that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations\nby the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and\nprocedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act\nis accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal\ncontrols and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the facts that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns\ncan occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some\npersons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the\ninherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility\nin the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. This risk is especially relevant\nfor us because biotechnology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years and we may\nbe the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and\ndivert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, so any returns will be limited to the value of\nour common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will\nretain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or\npaying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to any\nappreciation in the value of their stock.\n96\nTable of Contents\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might\ndiscourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contains provisions that\ncould depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our\ncompany or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. In addition,\nbecause our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may\nfrustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more\ndifficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. These provisions, among other things:\n● establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n● permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n● provide that directors may only be removed “for cause” and only with the approval of two-thirds of our\nstockholders;\n● authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder\nrights plan (also known as a “poison pill”);\n● eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n● prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting\nof our stockholders;\n● prohibit cumulative voting;\n● authorize our board of directors to amend the bylaws;\n● establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that\ncan be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings; and\n● require a super-majority vote of stockholders to amend or repeal specified provisions of our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (DGCL), prohibits a publicly-\nheld Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person\nwhich together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of\nthree years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business\ncombination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware\nlaw that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to\nreceive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to\npay for our common stock.\n97\nTable of Contents\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of\nthe United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could\nlimit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of\nChancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of\nDelaware) is the exclusive forum for the following (except for any claim as to which such court determines that there is\nan indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the\npersonal jurisdiction of such court within 10 days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive\njurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction):\n● any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n● any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty;\n● any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n● any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any\nother claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America\nwill be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us\nand our directors, officers and other employees. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in\nany of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. There is uncertainty as to\nwhether a court would enforce such provisions, and the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other\ncompanies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings. It is possible that a court could find these types\nof provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable, and if a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our\namended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated\nwith resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could seriously harm our business.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nNone.\nUse of Proceeds from Public Offering of Common Stock\nOn March 25, 2021, our registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC for our initial public\noffering of common stock. We began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 26, 2021 and the IPO formally\nclosed on March 30, 2021. In connection with our IPO, we issued and sold an aggregate of 12,650,000 shares of our common\nstock at a price of $16.00 per share, including 1,650,000 shares of our common stock issued and sold in connection with the\nfull exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The gross proceeds from the\noffering for shares sold in our IPO was $202.4 million. The joint book-running managers for the\n98\nTable of Contents\ninitial public offering were J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and SVB Leerink LLC. After deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs paid or payable by us of approximately $16.3 million, the net\nproceeds from the offering were approximately $186.1 million. No payments were made by us to directors, officers or persons\nowning ten percent or more of our common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates, other than payments in the ordinary\ncourse of business to officers for salaries and to non-employee directors pursuant to our director compensation policy.\nThere has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO as described in our final prospectus filed\nwith the SEC on March 26, 2021 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4). We invested the funds received in marketable securities as\ndescribed in more detail in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report until such time the funds are\nrequired for use in operations.\nUse of Proceeds from Follow-On Offering\nOn September 16, 2022, we completed a follow-on offering and issued 13,372,093 shares of our common stock at a price\nto the public of $10.32 per share, including 1,744,186 shares of common stock issued in connection with the full exercise by\nthe underwriters of their options to purchase additional shares of common stock. The aggregate gross proceeds from the\nfollow-on offering were $138.0 million. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $8.3 million and offering\ncosts of $0.5 million, the net proceeds from the follow-on offering were approximately $129.2 million.\nThere has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds in our follow-on offering as described in our final\nprospectus filed with the SEC on September 14, 2022 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). We invested the funds received in interest-\nbearing investment-grade securities.\nUse of Proceeds from the ATM Program\nOn June 16, 2023, we entered into a Sales Agreement with BofA Securities under which we may offer and sell shares of\ncommon stock, having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $125,000,000 from time to time, through an ATM Program. On\nJanuary 19, 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to suspend the ATM Program. Through the suspension of the ATM\nprogram, we sold 7,560,068 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $7.93 per share. The gross proceeds were\n$59.9 million, and the net proceeds were $59.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.2\nmillion and offering expenses of $0.3 million.\nThere has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from the ATM Program as described in our final\nprospectus filed with the SEC on June 16, 2023 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). We invested the funds received in interest-bearing\ninvestment-grade securities.\nUse of Proceeds from Underwritten Registered Direct Offering\nOn January 23, 2024, we closed an underwritten registered direct offering of 21,818,182 shares of common stock at a\npublic offering price of $11.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the underwritten registered direct offering were\n$240.0 million, and the net proceeds were $231.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $7.5\nmillion and offering expenses of $0.6 million.\nThere has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds in our January 2024 Offering as described in our final\nprospectus filed with the SEC on January 19, 2024 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5). We invested the funds received in interest-\nbearing investment-grade securities.\nRepurchase of our Common Stock\nNone.\n99\nTable of Contents\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDirector and Officer Trading Arrangements\nA portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, directors and officers\nengage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other securities of\nours, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised, and for diversification or other\npersonal reasons.\nTransactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading\npolicy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading\nwhile in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense\nthat enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating\ntransactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.\nThe following table describes, for the third quarter of 2024, each trading arrangement for the sale or purchase of our\nsecurities adopted by our directors and officers that is either (1) a contract, instruction or written plan intended to satisfy the\naffirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c), which we refer to as a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or (2) a “non-\nRule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K):\nAction Taken Type of trading Nature of Trading Duration of Trading Aggregate Number\nName (Title) (Date of Action) Arrangement Arrangement Arrangement of Securities\nKevin Koch (Chief Executive Adoption (September Rule 10b5-1 trading\nOfficer & Director) 30, 2024) arrangement Sale (1) (1)\nAlan Russell (Chief Scientific Adoption (September Rule 10b5-1 trading\nOfficer & Director) 30, 2024) arrangement Sale (2) (2)\nR.
