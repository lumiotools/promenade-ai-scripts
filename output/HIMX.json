We believe this will create new\nrevenue streams for Himax and make a significant contribution to our total revenue and profit\nin the coming years,” concluded Mr. Jordan Wu.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nHimax net revenues registered $222.4 million, a decrease of 7.2% sequentially, yet\nsignificantly exceeded its guidance range of a 12% to 17% decrease. Gross margin came in at\n30.0%, in-line with its guidance of around 30%, but down from 32.0% in the previous quarter\nand 31.4% in the same period last year. The sequential decline was a result of unfavorable\nproduct mix. Q3 profit per diluted ADS was 7.4 cents, considerably above the guidance range\nof 1.5 cents to 4.5 cents due to better-than-expected revenues.\nRevenue from large display drivers came in at $30.7 million, reflecting a sequential decrease\nof 21.2%. The decrease was primarily attributed to weaker monitor and TV IC sales due to\ncustomers’ de-stocking amid challenging market conditions following substantial Q2\nreplenishment for shopping festivals. In contrast, notebook IC sales increased notably,\nresulting from rush orders for legacy products from leading panel customers. Sales of large\npanel driver ICs accounted for 13.8% of total revenues for the quarter, compared to 16.3%\nlast quarter and 18.3% a year ago.\nSmall and medium-sized display driver segment totaled $155.4 million, a decline of 2.2%\nsequentially but significantly better than guidance of a low-teens decline, thanks to stronger-\nthan-expected sales in the automotive and tablet markets. In Q3, automotive driver sales,\nwhich include both traditional DDIC and TDDI, experienced a mid-single digit decrease, yet\nlargely outperformed Company’s expectation of a high teens decline. This better-than-\nexpected result was primarily fueled by rush orders from Chinese panel customers shortly\nafter Himax’s last earnings call on the backdrop of the Chinese government's renewed trade-\nin stimulus announcement made in mid-August, as part of their efforts to further boost\nautomobile consumption. Himax’s automotive business, comprising drivers, Tcon, and OLED\n2\nsales, remained the largest revenue contributor in the third quarter, representing nearly half\nof total sales. Meanwhile, Q3 tablet IC sales also exceeded guidance of a sequential decline,\nwith sales slightly up from last quarter, fueled by rush orders from leading end customers.\nQ3 smartphone IC sales increased a decent double-digit sequentially, thanks to new product\nlaunches of leading phone makers. The small and medium-sized driver IC segment\naccounted for 69.9% of total sales for the quarter, compared to 66.3% in the previous\nquarter and 67.6% a year ago.\nThird quarter revenues from its non-driver business reached $36.3 million, a decline of\n13.1% from the previous quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by a double-digit\nsequential decline in Tcon sales, particularly for monitor application, as customers pulled\nforward their inventory purchases in the prior quarter anticipating strong sales during the\nshopping festivals. However, automotive Tcon sales saw an impressive sequential increase of\nover 30%, as Himax’s solutions, especially the market leading local dimming Tcon, continue\nto be rapidly adopted by major panel manufacturers, Tier 1 suppliers, and automotive\nmanufacturers worldwide. In the third quarter, Himax’s Tcon business accounted for over\n9% of total sales, with notable contributions from automotive Tcon, representing almost half\nof Tcon sales, supported by steady growth with well over one hundred secured design-win\nprojects. Non-driver products accounted for 16.3% of total revenues, as compared to 17.4%\nin the previous quarter and 14.1% a year ago.\nOperating expenses for the third quarter were $60.8 million, an increase of 28.4% from the\nprevious quarter and a decline of 4.7% from a year ago. The sequential increase stemmed\nprimarily from the expense for annual bonus compensation which the Company awards\nemployees at the end of September each year, typically resulting in higher Q3 employee\ncompensation expense compared to other quarters of the year. The year-over-year decrease\nwas mainly due to a decline in employee bonus compensation as the amortized portion of\nprior year’s bonuses for last year was higher than that for this year. As a reminder, Himax\ngrants annual bonuses to employees at the end of September each year, including RSU and\ncash awards based on the expected profit for the full year. Himax’s annual bonus\ncompensation grant for 2024 was $12.5 million, in line with guidance, out of which $11.2\nmillion, was immediately vested and expensed in the third quarter. In comparison, the annual\nbonuses for 2023 and 2022 were $10.4 million and $39.6 million respectively, of which $9.7\nmillion and $18.5 million were vested and expensed immediately. To further elaborate,\nHimax’s Q3 bonus expense includes two portions. First, $11.2 million was the allocation for\nthe immediately vested and recognized portion of the current year's bonus grant. Second,\n$2.7 million was expensed for the amortized tranches of prior years' bonuses, compared to\n$2.8 million last quarter and $6.2 million a year ago. Amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges,\nHimax is strictly enforcing budget and expense controls, with full-year 2024 OPEX projected\nto decline mid-single digit compared to last year.\nQ3 operating income was $5.9 million or 2.6% of sales, compared to 12.2% last quarter and\n4.6% of sales for the same period last year. The sequential decrease, aside from lower sales\nand a contraction in gross margin, primarily reflected the difference in annual employee bonus\ncompensation, totaling $11.2 million or 5.1% of sales, the immediately vested and expensed\nportion of this year’s new grant. The year-over-year decrease in operating margin was mainly\ndriven by a decline in sales and lower gross margins. Third-quarter after-tax profit was $13.0\nmillion, or 7.4 cents per diluted ADS, compared to $29.6 million, or 16.9 cents per diluted ADS\nlast quarter, and $11.2 million, or 6.4 cents in the same period last year. In calculating the Q3\nafter-tax profit, Himax made a favorable income tax adjustment to rectify overestimated tax\nexpenses for preceding quarters this year, hence the sequential increase in after-tax profit.\n3\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nHimax had $206.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets at the end of\nSeptember 2024, compared to $253.8 million a quarter ago and $155.4 million at the same\ntime last year. The sequential decrease in cash balance was mainly the result of a $50.7\nmillion payment for annual dividends. Operating cash outflow for the third quarter was\napproximately $3.1 million, compared to an inflow of $26.9 million in Q2. The outflow was\nprimarily due to $30.1 million paid to employees for their bonuses, which included $10.8\nmillion for the immediately vested portion of this year’s award and $19.3 million for vested\nawards granted over the past three years. Operating cashflow excluding employee bonus\nwas a $27.0 million inflow during the quarter. Himax had $36.0 million of long-term\nunsecured loans as of the end of the third quarter, of which $6.0 million was the current\nportion.\nThe Company’s inventories as of September 30, 2024 were $192.5 million, lower than the\n$203.7 million last quarter and $259.6 million in the same period last year, indicating a well-\nmanaged and balanced inventory level from quarter to quarter. Accounts receivable at the\nend of September 2024 was $224.6 million, down from $242.4 million last quarter and $248.5\nmillion a year ago. DSO was 92 days at the quarter end, as compared to 99 days last quarter\nand 95 days a year ago. Third quarter capital expenditures were $2.6 million, versus $4.6\nmillion last quarter and $2.6 million a year ago. The third quarter capex was mainly for R&D\nrelated equipment for Company’s IC design business.\nOutstanding Share\nAs of September 30, 2024, Himax had 175.0 million ADS outstanding, little changed from last\nquarter. On a fully diluted basis, the total number of ADS outstanding for the third quarter\nwas 175.0 million.\nQ4 2024 Outlook\nLooking ahead to Q4, the macro environment remains challenging. Panel customers are\nreducing production to stabilize panel prices in response to the current market conditions. At\nthe same time, end brands are also taking a cautious approach to panel procurement and\nmaintaining low inventory levels. Taken together, these factors have suppressed IC demand,\nleading to Himax’s conservative outlook for the fourth quarter.\nAgainst this backdrop, Himax continues to strictly manage expenses and implement various\ncost optimization measures, including enhancing manufacturing and operational efficiency, as\nwell as leveraging a diverse range of vendors in foundries and backend suppliers. Looking\nahead, while the global economy still looks uncertain, Himax is confident in the business\noutlook of several key areas, namely automotive, AI, WLO, and OLED, and expect these\nproduct lines to drive significant growth of Himax’s business.\nOn the automotive sector, Himax’s primary revenue contributor. Himax remains optimistic in\nits long-term outlook as the automotive display market continues to expand through\ninnovation and technological advancements. Himax’s confidence also stems from its\ncomprehensive offering and leading position in the market, particularly in the areas of LCD\nTDDI, OLED, and Tcon, all of which are relatively new and cutting-edge technologies for\n4\nautomotive display. These technologies are expected to see continued adoption, providing\nHimax with sustainable long-term growth opportunities.\nIt's worth noting that there have been significant fluctuations in automotive market demands\nin recent quarters, particularly from the Chinese market, which accounts for over 30% of\nglobal vehicle sales. Government policies, subsidies, and aggressive discount campaigns by car\nmanufacturers have made supply and demand less predictable, creating new challenges for\nautomotive IC suppliers. Automotive ICs, unlike consumer electronics products, feature\nrigorous safety and reliability standards, resulting in longer production lead time, which poses\ngreater challenges in handling customers’ rush orders. However, thanks to Himax’s dominant\nmarket share and substantial shipment volume in the automotive sector, Himax is well-\nequipped to navigate these market fluctuations. In fact, Himax’s ability to respond to these\nlast-minute demands for automotive ICs was instrumental in Company’s better than expected\nthird quarter financial results, with final revenues exceeding the midpoint of Himax’s guidance\nby as much as 7%. The higher revenues were driven primarily by rush orders that arose after\nHimax’s last earnings call held in the middle of the third quarter. Indeed, being able to quickly\nrespond to changing customer needs has become a crucial competitive advantage in the\nautomotive IC sector for Himax.\nIn terms of WLO business, Himax is confident in its collaboration with FOCI on the LPO/CPO\nbusiness where I am pleased to share that Himax is making decent progress in the initial small-\nscale production of the first-generation solution. Demand for high-speed optical\ncommunication technology is surging, driven by advancements in high-performance\ncomputing and artificial intelligence. Moreover, Himax and FOCI, along with world-leading AI\nsemiconductor companies and foundry partner, have begun new technology development for\nfuture generation products. Himax believes this will create new revenue streams for the\nCompany and make a significant contribution to Himax’s total revenue and profit in the\ncoming years.\nDisplay Driver IC Businesses\nLDDIC\nIn Q4 2024, Himax anticipates a double-digit sequential sales decrease for large display\ndriver ICs due to soft holiday shopping demand expectations, ongoing customers destocking\nsince Q2, and intensified China local competition. Panel manufacturers are strategically\nreducing production to safeguard panel prices while end brands are enforcing strict\nprocurement control in response to soft demand and maintaining low inventory levels.\nLooking ahead in the notebook sector, the emergence of AI PC is prompting display\nupgrades towards OLED displays and displays equipped with touch features. Through\nstrategic collaborations with leading panel makers in Korea and China, Himax is well\npositioned to capitalize on this trend, offering a comprehensive range of notebook IC\nproducts including DDIC, Tcon, and touch controller for OLED displays and TDDI and Tcon for\nLCD display. First on TDDI for LCD, Himax is pioneering in-cell touch TDDI for notebook LCD\ndisplay. Himax’s state-of-the-art in-cell touch TDDI solution features a proprietary\narchitecture where the touch controller is embedded inside the TDDI chip with the display\nportion of the TDDI taking advantage of the conventional display driver configuration to\nconvey Tcon data to drive the panel. This allows customers to maintain the existing Tcon\nadoption, substantially reducing their product development effort and enhancing production\nflexibility. Additionally, the TDDI features high integration, multi-chip cascade, and increased\n5\nchannel output, enabling higher resolution of up to 4K and larger screen of up to 16 inches,\nwith compact PCB and narrower bezel designs, making it suitable for both mainstream and\nhigh-end LCD laptops. In the third quarter, Himax’s newly introduced in-cell touch TDDI\nsuccessfully entered mass production for a prominent brand's first AI PC. Several projects\nare also in progress with other brands for their upcoming notebook models.\nThe second area of focus is OLED, which is seeing increasing adoption in premium laptops. In\naddition to Himax’s OLED DDIC and Tcon solutions, Himax is also pioneering on-cell touch\ncontrol technology on notebook OLED display. Multiple projects with top panel and laptop\nleaders are underway. Finally, Himax is developing the next generation eDP 1.5 display\ninterface for Tcon, applicable to both LCD and OLED panels, supporting high frame rates, low\npower panel replay, adaptive sync, and high-resolution. Himax aims to launch eDP 1.5 Tcon\nin the second half of 2025. Himax is confident that, with these initiatives, Himax will be the\nfrontrunner for next-gen AI PCs and premium notebooks. With several projects slated for\nmass production starting in 2025, Himax believes its LCD and OLED notebook solutions will\nact as growth catalysts for Himax’s notebook IC business for the coming years.\nSMDDIC\nQ4 SMDDIC revenue is expected to be flat sequentially. Automotive IC revenue in Q4 is\nexpected to resume growth and increase single digit sequentially, mainly supported by\nongoing China market promotional events and the Chinese government’s renewed trade-in\nstimulus policies. Notably, Himax’s automotive driver IC sales for the full year 2024 are\nprojected to grow high-teens year-over-year, significantly outperforming global automotive\ngrowth, primarily driven by continued expansion of TDDI adoption among all major end\ncustomers worldwide. In the automotive TDDI sector, Himax continues to strengthen\nHimax’s market dominance with cumulative shipments already exceeding 70 million units,\nfar surpassing those of Company’s competitors. With nearly 500 design-in projects secured\nand only about 30% currently in mass production, Himax continues to see substantial growth\npotential ahead. Remarkably, Himax’s Q4 automotive TDDI sales are set to surpass DDIC\nsales for the first time, highlighting the widespread adoption of Himax’s solutions\nworldwide, along with growing demand for more intuitive, interactive, and cost competitive\ntouch panel features enabled by TDDI solutions. While Himax’s full year 2024 traditional\nautomotive DDIC sales are expected to decline as they are partially replaced by TDDI, the\nCompany’s shipping quantity for DDIC is set to see a modest increase. This is indicative of\nthe product’s long-life cycle as many of our customers’ legacy models will not be retired for\nyears, and many displays, such as cluster display, HUD, or rear- and side-view mirrors, do not\nrequire touch feature. Himax remains the leader of the automotive DDIC market, with\napproximately 40% global market share.\nMeanwhile, an emerging market trend shows more customers are opting for Himax’s TDDI\nor LTDI, coupled with Himax’s local dimming Tcon, as their standard development platforms\nfor new automotive displays across various sizes and applications. This growing platform\nadoption of more of Himax’s automotive IC offerings not only reflects strong customer\nloyalty to Himax’s technologies and services but also signifies the increase in content value\nfor Himax on a per-panel basis. Himax is widely recognized as the leader in the automotive\ndisplay IC market, offering the industry's broadest range of products with leading market\nshare in each of the product areas. The diverse range of offerings allows Himax to address\ndifferent customer needs and adapt to changing market trends, thereby strengthening\nHimax’s market presence and boosting potential revenue. Himax’s newly introduced TED\n(Tcon Embedded Driver IC) solution, which combines TDDI with local dimming Tcon into a\n6\nsingle chip, exemplifies its commitment to providing customers with more competitive,\nflexible and broader options. This solution is ideal for smaller panels that typically require\nonly 1 to 2 ICs for cost consideration, while still offering advanced touch and local dimming\nfeatures. Production is set to begin in early 2025 with several projects and engagements\ncurrently underway with major customers. Meanwhile, Himax is actively collaborating with\nautomotive Tier 1 partners to develop more advanced, innovative and/or cost optimized\nsolutions tailored to various market needs. This not only underscores Himax’s customers'\nconfidence in its technology leadership but also reflects their commitment to engaging with\nHimax in future roadmap collaborations.\nOn smartphone IC sales, Himax anticipates Q4 to slightly decline sequentially with ongoing\nshipment to key customers. Q4 tablet IC sales are projected to decline low teens sequentially,\nas end customers are extending their replacement cycles due to challenging economic\nconditions.\nOn OLED business. In the automotive OLED market, Himax has formed strategic partnerships\nwith leading panel manufacturers in Korea, China, and Japan. As OLED technology gains\ntraction beyond premium car models, Himax is well-positioned as the preferred partner,\nthanks to Himax’s strong presence and proven track records in the LCD automotive display\nsector. Leveraging Himax’s first-mover advantage, Himax looks to capitalize on the growing\nadoption of OLED in automotive displays by offering a comprehensive range of OLED solutions,\nincluding DDIC, Tcon, and on-cell touch controller. Himax believes this positions the Company\nas the primary beneficiary of the growing adoption of OLED display in automotive. For instance,\nHimax’s advanced OLED on-cell touch controllers are setting new industry standards with an\nimpressive touch signal-to-noise ratio of over 45 dB, ensuring reliable performance under\nchallenging conditions such as glove-wearing or wet-finger operations. Himax’s OLED on-cell\ntouch controller for automotive applications entered production last quarter and adoption is\nexpanding across the board. With additional projects starting mass production next year,\nHimax expects this segment’s contribution to its revenues to increase starting in 2025.\nBeyond the automotive sector, Himax has made notable advances in the tablet and notebook\nsectors with top OLED panel manufacturers in Korea and China. Himax’s comprehensive OLED\nproduct offerings, encompassing DDIC, Tcon, and touch controllers, have led to several new\nprojects that are on track to enter mass production during Q4 and as the Company moves into\n2025. Regarding smartphone OLED, Himax expects mass production to commence next year.\nCurrently, Himax is making good progress in collaborations with customers in Korea and China\non several verification and partnership projects. Additionally, Himax is building strong, long-\nterm partnerships with leading OLED players to enhance Himax’s market position.\nNon-Driver Product Categories\nQ4 non-driver IC revenues are expected to increase mid-teens sequentially.\nTiming Controller (Tcon)\nHimax anticipates Q4 Tcon sales to increase mid-teens sequentially, driven by automotive and\na one-time ASIC Tcon product shipment to a leading projector customer. Automotive Tcon\nbusiness is expected to achieve high-teens growth sequentially, driven by the shipment of\nsecured design wins. For the full year, Himax’s automotive Tcon business is projected to grow\nover 80% compared to last year, contributing to nearly 4% of Himax’s total sales.

(Nasdaq: HIMX) (“Himax” or\n“Company”), a leading supplier and fabless manufacturer of display drivers and other\nsemiconductor products, announced its financial results for the second quarter 2024 ended\nJune 30, 2024.\n“Given the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, end customers remain conservative\ncausing panel makers to take a cautious stance and strictly control production to maintain low\ninventory levels. This is adversely impacting IC demand, leading to our conservative third\nquarter forecast,” said Mr. Jordan Wu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Himax.\n“During the second quarter in the automotive market, car makers initially anticipated a sales\nboost due to promotional activities and government subsidies especially in China.\nConsequently, we saw a major uptick in the second quarter IC sales along with the aggressive\ndiscount campaigns of car makers. However, these intense campaigns did not generate the\nanticipated sales growth and may have even triggered consumers to hesitate in purchasing\nnew cars, leading to disappointing car sales in China for the second quarter and resulting in\nexcessive inventories throughout the supply chain. As a result, our panel customers have\nbegun to scale back their IC procurement in Q3 to manage inventory levels. In comparison,\nthe automotive markets in Europe and the U.S. have remained relatively stable since last year,\nwithout experiencing the dramatic fluctuations seen in China. As the leader of the automotive\ndisplay ICs, we serve a diverse range of brands worldwide, with sales evenly distributed across\nall major markets. However, since China is the world’s largest automotive market,\ncommanding over 30% of the global sales, fluctuations in China do have a substantial impact\non our business. Despite the recent challenges, we remain optimistic about our automotive\nIC business and are committed to the long-term innovation and development of our\nautomotive products. The automotive display market remains on solid footing with a positive\ngrowth trajectory driven by versatile innovations and technology advancements. Advanced\nand fancier displays are increasingly becoming a major selling point for car makers, driving the\nautomotive display market towards a megatrend of expanding quantities, sizes, and\nsophistication,” concluded Mr. Jordan Wu.\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nHimax net revenues registered $239.6 million, an increase of 15.5% sequentially, exceeding\nguidance range of an 8% to 13% increase. Gross margin came in at 32.0%, in line with guidance\nrange of 31.5% to 33.5%, up from 29.3% of the previous quarter and 21.7% same period last\nyear. The sequential growth was driven by cost improvements and a favorable product mix,\nalong with increased sales in the automotive IC and Tcon product lines, both of which have\nhigher than corporate average gross margins. The substantial improvement in gross margin\nfrom the same period last year was primarily due to the one-time early termination expense\npaid to foundry partners which eliminated minimum fulfillment requirement constraints and\nhigh wafer costs set during the severe industry capacity shortage. Consequently, Himax’s new\nwafer starts are no longer bound by these restrictive terms. Additionally, Himax can now\nleverage diverse foundry sources for optimal operational efficiency and a significantly\nimproved cost structure, thereby maintaining the Company’s product competitiveness. Q2\n2\nprofit per diluted ADS was 16.9 cents, at the top end of the guidance range of 13.0 cents to\n17.0 cents.\nRevenue from large display drivers came in at $39.0 million, reflecting a sequential increase\nof 24.7%. The increase was predominantly driven by customer restocking in TV and monitor\nICs after several quarters of muted demand, as well as increased orders in preparation for\nshopping festivals. Both TV and monitor ICs sales posted substantial double-digit increases\nquarter over quarter. In contrast, Q2 notebook IC sales declined slightly following strong\nrestocking in the previous quarter. Sales of large panel driver ICs accounted for 16.3% of total\nrevenues for the quarter, compared to 15.1% last quarter and 19.3% a year ago.\nSmall and medium-sized display driver revenue reached $158.8 million, marking a sequential\nincrease of 10.1% and surpassing the guidance due to stronger-than-anticipated sales in the\nTDDI products for automotive, smartphone and tablet. In Q2, automotive driver sales,\nencompassing both traditional DDIC and TDDI, increased by a decent high-teens sequentially\nand more than 50% year-over-year. Despite expectations of weakening electric vehicle\ndemand, both automotive DDIC and TDDI sales experienced sequential growth in Q2 thanks\nto the Company’s robust design-win pipeline in TDDI and customers’ continuous restocking\nmomentum in DDIC since end of Q1. Himax’s automotive business, comprising drivers, Tcon,\nand OLED sales, remained the largest revenue contributor in the second quarter,\nrepresenting over 47% of total sales. Meanwhile, Q2 tablet IC sales slightly increased\nsequentially, surpassing guidance of a decline, fueled by leading customers' new model\nramp-ups. Conversely, smartphone driver sales declined as expected during a subdued\nfestival season characterized by sluggish demand. The small and medium-sized driver IC\nsegment accounted for 66.3% of total sales for the quarter, compared to 69.5% in the\nprevious quarter and 63.9% a year ago.\nSecond quarter revenues from its non-driver business reached $41.8 million, up 30.6% from\nthe previous quarter, due to a resurgence in orders for its Tcon products for TV, monitor,\nautomotive as well as OLED tablet. Himax’s automotive local dimming Tcon, where Himax\ndominates the market, has been swiftly adopted by major panel makers, Tier 1 suppliers,\nand car manufacturers worldwide, boasting well over one hundred design-win projects with\nonly a small number of design awards having commenced mass production. This momentum\nis further fueled by the rapid expansion of project awards across continents, positioning\nHimax for strong growth, mirroring the success Himax has achieved in automotive TDDI.\nTcon business represented over 10% of its total sales in the second quarter. Non-driver\nproducts accounted for 17.4% of total revenues, as compared to 15.4% in the previous\nquarter and 16.8% a year ago.\nOperating expenses for the second quarter were $47.3 million, a decrease of 6.7% from the\nprevious quarter and a decline of 11.1% from a year ago. The sequential decrease was\nprimarily driven by decreases in tape-out expenses. The year-over-year decrease was\nprimarily due to reduced tape-out expenses and a decline in the annual bonuses for the\namortized tranches of the previous years’ bonuses. Amid ongoing macroeconomic challenges,\nthe Company is strictly enforcing budget and expense controls to manage these conditions.\nQ2 operating income was $29.3 million or 12.2% of sales, compared to -0.9% of sales for the\nsame period last year and 4.8% of sales last quarter. Both the sequential and year-over-year\nincreases were primarily due to higher sales and an improved gross margin. Second-quarter\nafter-tax profit was $29.6 million, or 16.9 cents per diluted ADS, compared to $12.5 million,\nor 7.1 cents per diluted ADS last quarter, and $0.9 million, or 0.5 cents in the same period last\n3\nyear. The after-tax profit for the first half was $42.1 million, or 24.1 cents per diluted ADS, a\nsignificant increase from $15.8 million, or 9.1 cents, for the same period last year.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nHimax had $253.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets at the end of\nJune 2024, compared to $277.4 million a quarter ago and $219.5 million at the same time\nlast year. The sequential decrease in cash balance was primarily due to customer refunds for\ntheir deposits made during the industry-wide capacity shortage, along with a strategic\ninvestment of approximately $16 million in FOCI through private placement. The cash\nbalance reduction was partially offset by an operating cash inflow of $26.9 million during the\nquarter. Compared to the operating cash inflow of $56.7 million in Q1, the sequential\ndecrease was mainly attributable to reduced sales over the preceding two quarters, leading\nto lower receivables. Additionally, the increase in accounts payable in Q2 was a result of\nhigher Q1 wafer orders, as the Company anticipated larger shipment volumes in Q2. Other\nsignificant operating cash outflows in Q2 included annual income tax payments. Looking\nahead to Q3, Himax anticipates a decline in cash, cash equivalents, and other financial\nassets, primarily due to a payment of $50.7 million for annual dividends to shareholders.\nHimax also expects to distribute a total of approximately $30.7 million for employee bonus\nawards at the end of this quarter, which includes around $11.3 million for the immediately\nvested portion of this year’s awards, with the actual amount subject to the final Board\ndecision, and $19.4 million for vested awards granted over the past three years.\nThe Company’s inventories as of June 30, 2024 were $203.7 million, similar to $201.9 million\nlast quarter, indicating a well-managed and balanced inventory level. Accounts receivable at\nthe end of June 2024 was $242.4 million, up from $212.3 million last quarter and $239.0\nmillion a year ago. DSO was 99 days at the quarter end, as compared to 93 days last quarter\nand 90 days a year ago. Second quarter capital expenditures were $4.6 million, versus $2.7\nmillion last quarter and $2.9 million a year ago. The second quarter capex was mainly for R&D\nrelated equipment and in-house tester for the Company’s IC design business.\nOutstanding Share\nAs of June 30, 2024, Himax had 174.7 million ADS outstanding, unchanged from last quarter.\nOn a fully diluted basis, the total number of ADS outstanding for the second quarter was 175.1\nmillion.\nQ3 2024 Outlook\nGiven the prevailing macroeconomic uncertainty, end customers remain conservative causing\npanel makers to take a cautious stance and strictly control production to maintain low\ninventory levels. This is adversely impacting IC demand, leading to Himax’s conservative third\nquarter forecast.\nDuring the second quarter in the automotive market, car makers initially anticipated a sales\nboost due to promotional activities and government subsidies especially in China.\nConsequently, Himax saw a major uptick in the second quarter IC sales along with the\naggressive discount campaigns of car makers. However, these intense campaigns did not\ngenerate the anticipated sales growth and may have even triggered consumers to hesitate in\npurchasing new cars, leading to disappointing car sales in China for the second quarter and\nresulting in excessive inventories throughout the supply chain. As a result, Himax’s panel\n4\ncustomers have begun to scale back their IC procurement in Q3 to manage inventory levels.\nIn comparison, the automotive markets in Europe and the U.S. have remained relatively stable\nsince last year, without experiencing the dramatic fluctuations seen in China. As the leader of\nthe automotive display ICs, Himax serves a diverse range of brands worldwide, with sales\nevenly distributed across all major markets. However, since China is the world’s largest\nautomotive market, commanding over 30% of the global sales, fluctuations in China do have\na substantial impact on its business. Moving forward, Himax will navigate the current\nchallenging business environment through close collaborations with panel makers and Tier 1\nsuppliers, meticulously managing its wafer starts and closely monitoring customer demands.\nThe automotive IC business is Himax’s largest revenue contributor, accounting for over 47%\nof our total revenues in Q2, significantly higher than peers.\nDespite the recent challenges, Himax remains optimistic about its automotive IC business\nand is committed to the long-term innovation and development of its automotive products.\nThe automotive display market remains on solid footing with a positive growth trajectory\ndriven by versatile innovations and technology advancements. Advanced and fancier\ndisplays are increasingly becoming a major selling point for car makers, driving the\nautomotive display market towards a megatrend of expanding quantities, sizes, and\nsophistication. As the leading player in the automotive display IC market, Himax is well-\npositioned to be the key beneficiary of the trend. Himax commands a 40% global market\nshare in traditional automotive DDIC and holds an even larger share in both the automotive\nTDDI and local dimming Tcon markets. In addition to offering the most comprehensive range\nof automotive IC products for LCD panels, Himax is actively expanding into the automotive\nOLED panel market, forming strategic partnerships with major leading panel makers in\nKorea, China and Japan to develop comprehensive solutions encompassing DDIC, Tcon, and\ntouch controller ICs. This proactive approach positions Himax to navigate industry shifts and\ncapitalize on the anticipated wide-spread adoption of OLED displays in the high-end vehicles,\nfurther solidifying its market leadership.\nDuring the quarter, Himax announced two substantial strategic investments. First, in an effort\nto strengthen the long-term partnership with FOCI, Himax, as a strategic investor, acquired a\n5.3% equity stake through private placement. The partnership integrates Himax’s Wafer Level\nOptics (“WLO”) expertise and FOCI's optical fiber know-how to create innovative, world-\nleading Linear-drive Pluggable Optics (“LPO”) and Co-Packaged Optics (“CPO”) solutions for\nadvanced Multi-Chip Modules (“MCMs”) required for the fast-growing cloud AI and high-\nspeed computing markets. This collaboration not only highlights the application versatility of\nthe WLO technology and Himax’s market leadership but also underscores the significant\npotential of Himax’s WLO in advancing LPO/CPO technology, which is vital for the\nadvancement of cloud AI and high-speed computing. Separately, Himax invested in the U.S.-\nbased Obsidian Sensors, whose revolutionary high-resolution thermal imaging sensors meet\nthe growing demand of thermal imaging across various industries, including automotive,\nsecurity, surveillance, drones, and military. This investment broadens the Company’s portfolio\nof imaging sensors, which, when meshed with Himax’s ultralow power WiseEye AI, enable\nenhanced sensor fusion possibilities for endpoint AI applications. The Obsidian investment\npositions Himax at the forefront of machine vision AI applications, delivering high\neffectiveness particularly in harsh environments and completely dark scenarios.\nAs the Company looks ahead, Himax’s focus remains on enhancing profitability, strengthening\noperational resilience, and improving adaptability to the evolving market. Himax continues to\noptimize the Company’s cost structure and reinforce its supplier diversification strategies for\nfoundries as well as backend packaging and testing. At the same time, Himax remains\n5\ncommitted to stringent expense control, set to further reduce operating expenses compared\nto last year. For reference, Himax achieved a 4% year-over-year reduction in operating\nexpenses in 2023.\nDisplay Driver IC Businesses\nLDDIC\nIn Q3 2024, Himax anticipates a double-digit sequential revenue decrease for large display\ndriver ICs, primarily due to subdued monitor and TV IC sales, set to decline double digit and\nsingle digit respectively, following substantial order replenishment in preparation for\nshopping festivals in the previous quarter. Procurements from Himax’s leading panel\ncustomers have become more conservative due to sluggish market conditions driven by\nworse-than-expected shopping festival sales. However, notebook IC sales are poised for a\ndecent increase, bolstered by robust order replenishment from the Company’s leading panel\ncustomers.\nLooking ahead in the notebook sector, Himax has made a strategic effort to position the\nCompany to capitalize on the anticipated rising demands for two new market areas, namely\nLCD displays equipped with touch features and OLED displays, both expected to enjoy\ndecent penetration in premium notebook and the upcoming AI PC markets. Leveraging\nHimax’s industry leadership in TDDI solutions for tablet market, it is working closely with LCD\npanel customers in the development of in-cell TDDI and new generation Tcon solutions for\nLCD displays. Concurrently, Himax has made significant strides in OLED technology for\nnotebook in strategic partnerships with leading panel manufacturers in Korea and China,\ndeveloping state-of-the-art touch controllers, DDIC and Tcon solutions. Some of the projects\nabove, including in-cell TDDI for mainstream LCD notebooks and Tcon and DDIC for OLED\nnotebooks, are slated for mass production in the second half of this year with leading panel\ncustomers. The Company is optimistic that the notebook segment will act as a strong growth\ncatalyst for Himax as it moves into 2025.\nSMDDIC\nQ3 SMDDIC revenue is expected to decline low teens sequentially. Impacted by customers’\ndestocking measures, especially for the Chinese market, automotive revenue in Q3 is\nexpected to decrease high teens sequentially, following high-teens growth of both DDIC and\nTDDI in Q2. That being said, through the first 9 months of the year, Himax’s automotive\ndriver IC sales are still set to grow mid-teens year-over-year, driven by continued expansion\nof TDDI adoption across all major end customers. Himax has secured over 450 TDDI design-\nwin projects, with only approximately 30% currently in mass production, indicating\nsignificant growth potential going forward. Meanwhile, a trend is emerging where more\ncustomers are opting for Himax’s TDDI or LTDI, along with its local dimming Tcon, as their\nstandard development platform for creating new automotive displays of various sizes. This\ngrowing adoption of more of Himax’s automotive IC offerings also signifies an increase in\ncontent value for Himax on a per-panel basis. Himax is widely recognized as the leader in the\nautomotive display IC market, offering the industry's broadest range of products, from\ntraditional DDIC and TDDI to advanced technologies such as local dimming Tcon, LTDI, and\nOLED. Himax is committed to continuously enhancing Himax’s product portfolio to meet\ncustomers diverse and evolving needs. Himax’s newly introduced TDDI incorporating local\ndimming Tcon in one chip exemplifies this commitment to providing customers with more\n6\noptions, as the new solution is ideal for smaller panels that usually require only 1 to 2 ICs for\ncost considerations while still equipped with advanced touch and local dimming features.\nOn Q3 smartphone IC sales, the Company expects a decent double-digit increase\nsequentially thanks to new product launches by key customers during the quarter. In\ncontrast to the positive outlook in smartphone business, Q3 tablet sales are projected to\ndecline sequentially, as end customers prolong their replacement cycles in response to\nchallenging economic conditions.\nFor the automotive OLED market, Himax has formed strategic alliances with leading panel\nmanufacturers in Korea, China and Japan. Leveraging Himax’s leadership in automotive LCD\ntechnology and OLED design expertise, these partnerships further strengthen the Company’s\npresence in the market. The Company offers a comprehensive suite of OLED solutions for\nautomotive, including DDIC, Tcon, and on-cell touch controllers, ensuring complete coverage\nof customer requirements. Notably, the Company’s meticulously engineered OLED on-cell\ntouch controllers set a new standard, boasting an industry-leading touch signal-to-noise ratio\nof over 45 dB, greatly enhancing sensitivity. This allows automotive displays to maintain\nproper functionality under challenging conditions, such as glove-wearing and wet finger\noperations. Himax is pleased to share that its OLED on-cell touch controller for automotive\nhas entered production this quarter. With additional projects set for mass production soon,\nthe Company anticipates sales of its OLED on-cell touch controller to further bolster\nCompany’s revenues starting 2025.\nBeyond Himax’s automotive OLED sector, the Company has made notable advances in the\ntablet and notebook sectors with top OLED panel manufacturers in Korea and China. Himax’s\ncomprehensive OLED product offerings, encompassing DDIC, Tcon, and touch controllers,\nhave led to several new projects that are on track to enter mass production later in the year.\nRegarding smartphone OLED, the current market drawdown of Himax’s customers has\nprompted it to revise Company’s production timeline to next year. Despite these challenges,\nHimax is actively collaborating with customers in Korea and China and have several\nverification and partnership projects currently in progress.\nNon-Driver Product Categories\nTiming Controller (Tcon)\nHimax anticipates a double-digit sequential decline in Q3 Tcon sales as customers pulled\nforward their inventory purchases during the prior quarter particularly for monitor application.\nHowever, Himax’s automotive Tcon business is expected to achieve a decent double-digit\ngrowth in Q3, despite the current headwinds in the automotive market, fueled by the\nshipment of new projects from previously secured design-wins. Since only a small portion of\nthe secured design-wins are currently in mass production, Himax anticipates significant\ngrowth potential for its automotive Tcon business in the coming years.\nWhile ongoing weak macroeconomic conditions continue to subdue demand in consumer\nelectronics, some of its newly developed Tcon ICs for OLED tablets and ePaper displays are\nstarting to show promising results. In the tablet segment, Himax is expanding its product\nlineup and strengthening its position in the high-value-added OLED market, building on\nHimax’s early success in the tablet OLED market. For the rapidly growing ePaper market,\nHimax recently made a joint announcement with E Ink, the global leader in ePaper market, to\nunveil T2000, a state-of-the-art, next-generation color ePaper Tcon. ePaper stands out for its\n7\nenergy efficiency, consuming power only during screen updates. Leveraging Himax’s decades\nof expertise in image display processing and Tcon design, the T2000 Tcon accelerates screen\nupdates for a better viewing experience while greatly reducing power consumption of the\nePaper display. Additionally, the T2000 features an exclusive handwriting processing\naccelerator, enabling seamless, nearly lag-free handwriting while boosting prompt display\nresponsiveness on ePaper displays without requiring a SoC. It also enables richer and more\nvibrant colors, enhancing the display’s visual appeal across a broad spectrum of E Ink’s color\nePaper platforms. The collaboration opens new possibilities for color ePaper applications in\neReaders, ePaper, digital signages, and more.\nWiseEyeTM Ultralow Power AI Sensing\nHimax’s WiseEye™ Ultralow Power AI Sensing is a cutting-edge endpoint AI integration\nsolution featuring proprietary ultralow power AI processors, always-on CMOS image sensors,\nand advanced CNN-based AI algorithm.

Himax sees growing traction and extensive engineering activities for this\ncontactless biometric authentication solution that can authenticate an individual's identity in\nunder 100 milliseconds while consuming just a few milliwatts of power. This represents a\nsignificant breakthrough in security technology by enabling biometric authentication in\nbattery-powered devices. With outstanding accuracy and robust liveness check capabilities,\npalm vein authentication significantly reduces the risk of duplication or spoofing compared to\nconventional fingerprint or face recognition, making it an ideal choice for indoor security, login\nauthentication, and other access control applications. WiseEye PalmVein upholds robust\nsecurity standards while offering best-in-class power efficiency, making it the only solution\nsuitable for battery-powered devices. Himax is collaborating with vendors across various\nsectors globally, including door lock, access control, notebook and automotive. While just\nlaunched at the beginning of the year, WiseEye PalmVein has already been successfully\nadopted by a U.S. customer for smart security and is set to commence mass production\nstarting the end of this year. The Company believes WiseEye PalmVein will profoundly impact\nthe security industry and unlock new opportunities for battery-powered devices across\nvarious use cases.\nTo broaden WiseEye AI’s market reach and shorten customer development cycles, Himax also\nprovides seamlessly integrated plug-and-play WiseEye Modules and no-code/low-code AI\ndevelopment platforms, featuring diverse context-aware AI algorithms that customers can\nreprogram or fine-tune with minimal effort for real-world use cases. Himax’s recent\n8\nannouncement with NVIDIA TAO exemplifies this approach whereby its WiseEye Module\ncustomers targeting AI deployment on resource-constrained endpoint devices can easily\noptimize and quantize deep learning models with pretrained enterprise-ready AI models and\ntools offered by NVIDIA. This facilitates rapid democratization of endpoint AI applications\nusing cost-effective, production-ready AI modules for various use cases.\nAdditionally, in response to growing AI-driven demand towards machine-vision across various\nenvironments, Himax recently made a strategic investment in Obsidian Sensors, a San Diego-\nbased company renowned for its revolutionary, high-resolution, low-cost thermal sensors,\noffering unmatched versatility by detecting heat differences even in complete darkness,\nmeasuring temperature, and identifying distant objects. This investment expands Himax’s\nimage sensor portfolio beyond optical sensors to include thermal sensors, a valuable\ncomplement to Himax’s product suite which is now widened to cover harsh sensing conditions\nsuch as heavy fog or complete darkness. Moreover, this strategic investment promises\nsynergy of the two companies with Himax’s WiseEye AI aggregating data from both optical\nand thermal imaging sensors for a truly holistic view of the environment beyond human vision.\nIn addition, Himax is engaged in ongoing engineering collaborations that leverage Himax’s IC\ndesign resources and know-how. Himax believes by integrating the strength of Himax and\nObsidian, the Company can seize new opportunities in the expanding sensor and AI markets\nacross industrial, defense, security, consumer electronics, and automotive sectors. As an\nillustration, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a new rule\nin April 2024, mandating that Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), including Pedestrian AEB\n(PAEB), be implemented starting in 2029. This regulation aims to significantly reduce rear-end\nand pedestrian crashes. Similar rules are increasingly being mandated by regulatory\nauthorities worldwide. The novel ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and AEB system,\nintegrated with Obsidian’s thermal sensors, provides clear vision in low-light and adverse\nweather conditions such as fog, smoke, rain, and snow. This ensures better driving safety and\nsecurity, underscoring the trend and significant potential demand for thermal imaging sensors.\nWafer Level Optics (WLO)\nDuring the second quarter, Himax made a strategic investment in FOCI, a Taiwan-based global\nleader for silicon photonics connector, through a $16 million private placement, resulting in a\n5.3% equity stake. This collaboration highlights the immense potential of Himax’s WLO\ntechnology for LPO/CPO which are crucial for further advancing high-speed AI and HPC\ntechnologies. Company’s partnership integrates FOCI's proprietary LPO/CPO connector\ntechnology with Himax's nano-scale Wafer Level Optics know-how to create an industry-\nleading optical transmission solution catered for the most advanced multi-chip modules,\nwhich demand enhanced bandwidth, improved data rate, minimized signal loss, reduced\nlatency, and lower energy consumption, all for accommodating future-generation needs of\nGenerative AI and HPC. Currently, in close collaboration with world leading AI semiconductor\nplayers and foundry partner, Himax is working closely with FOCI on LPO/CPO development for\nproducts that meet customers’ near-term production goals.\nLPO/CPO technology is crucial for furthering Generative AI and HPC and will continue to evolve\nrapidly to meet the explosive demand in these areas. Himax is committed to advancing the\ntechnology with FOCI, ensuring solutions stay at the cutting edge and align with the multi-year\nroadmaps of roadmaps of our AI chip and foundry partners/customers. The Company believes\nthis will generate new, long-lasting revenue streams for Himax.\n9\nAs FOCI is a company listed on the Taipei Exchange (TPEx), the stock price and resulting “fair\nvalue” reflected on Himax’s books change each day. These fluctuations have been, and will\ncontinue to be, recognized by way of changes in owners’ equity as a balance sheet item, not\naffecting Himax’s profit and loss. As an illustration, based on the close of FOCI’s stock price as\nof the end of June 2024, Himax made a “gain” of $9.6 million on Himax’s $16 million FOCI\ninvestment. However, the said “gain” was not recorded as an investment profit in the\nCompany’s Q2 financial statements and instead was booked as an increase in owners’ equity.\nLikewise, upon disposal, the resulting investment gain or loss will also be recognized as a\nchange of equity, through retained earnings, thus not affecting the Company’s profit and loss\nat the time of the disposal either. The accounting method the Company choses reflects\nHimax’s long-term commitment to the FOCI investment.\nWith over a decade of experience in WLO, Himax has developed diverse designs across a broad\nspectrum, including 3D sensing, AR/VR devices, biomedical inspection, and optical\ncommunication, just to name a few. These technologies have been widely adopted by some\nof the world's most prominent tech companies, with cumulative shipments reaching more\nthan 600 million units. Himax anticipates WLO playing an even more decisive role in the next-\ngeneration optical technology landscape, thanks to its versatile, high-precision, lightweight\nand small form factor characteristics that are not feasible with alternative technologies. In\naddition to the progress made in LPO/CPO, Himax is seeing an increase in engineering projects\nwith globally recognized leaders who are leveraging Himax’s WLO expertise for their upcoming\nAR/VR devices, underscoring the widespread recognition of the Company’s technology.\nFor non-driver IC businesses, Himax expects revenue to decline high teens sequentially in the\nthird quarter.\nThird Quarter 2024 Guidance\nNet Revenue: Decrease 12.0% to 17.0% sequentially\nGross Margin: Around 30%, depending on final product mix\nProfit: 1.5 cents to 4.5 cents per diluted ADS\nAs the Company done historically, Himax will grant employees’ annual bonus, including RSUs\nand cash awards, on or around September 30 this year. The third quarter guidance for profit\nper diluted ADS has taken into account the expected 2024 annual bonus, which, subject to\nBoard approval, is now assumed to be around $12.5 million, out of which $11.3 million will be\nvested and expensed immediately on the grant date. As a reminder, the total annual bonus\namount and the immediately vested portion are Himax’s current best estimates only and the\nactual amounts could vary materially depending on, among other things, its Q4 profit and the\nfinal Board decision for the total bonus amount and its vesting scheme. As is the case for\nprevious years, Himax expects the annual bonus grant in 2024 to lead to higher third quarter\noperating expenses compared to the other quarters of the year. In comparison, the annual\nbonus for 2023 and 2022 were $10.4 million and $39.6 million respectively, of which $9.7\nmillion and $18.5 million vested immediately.\nIn providing Himax’s Q3 financial guidance, the Q3 expense related to employee bonus is\nestimated to be $14.2 million, comprised of $11.3 million, the immediately vested portion of\nthis year’s bonus, and $2.9 million, the amortized portion of the previous years’ unvested\nbonuses. For the sake of completeness, employee bonus expense in each of the last three\nquarters was also around $2.9 million.\n10\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES SECOND QUARTER 2024 EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nDATE: Thursday, August 8, 2024\nTIME: U.S. 8:00 a.m. EDT\nTaiwan 8:00 p.m.\nLive Webcast (Video and Audio): http://www.zucast.com/webcast/HlPPY5TZ\nToll Free Dial-in Number (Audio Only):\nHong Kong 2112-1444\nTaiwan 0080-119-6666\nAustralia 1-800-015-763\nCanada 1-877-252-8508\nChina (1) 4008-423-888\nChina (2) 4006-786-286\nSingapore 800-492-2072\nUK 0800-068-8186\nUnited States (1) 1-800-811-0860\nUnited States (2) 1-866-212-5567\nDial-in Number (Audio Only):\nTaiwan Domestic Access 02-3396-1191\nInternational Access +886-2-3396-1191\nParticipant PIN Code: 1134008 #\nIf you choose to attend the call by dialing in via phone, please enter the Participant PIN Code\n1134008 # after the call is connected.

(Nasdaq: HIMX) (“Himax” or\n“Company”), a leading supplier and fabless manufacturer of display drivers and other\nsemiconductor products, announced its financial results for the first quarter 2024 ended\nMarch 31, 2024.\n“We believe Q1 will be the low point for this year and see sales starting to pick up in Q2,\nespecially in the automotive sector. With several other upcoming demand catalysts on the\nhorizon, including major sporting events and festival shopping seasons, business momentum\nis expected to continue to steadily improve throughout the second half,” said Mr. Jordan Wu,\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of Himax.\n“The automotive display market is experiencing a megatrend of expanding quantities, sizes,\nand sophistication of displays within vehicles as fancy displays are increasingly becoming a\nmajor selling point for car makers. As the leader in the automotive display IC business, Himax\nis poised to benefit from this trend, which implies higher content value per vehicle for display\nsemiconductor vendors such as us, leading to sustainable growth slated for the next few years,”\nconcluded Mr. Jordan Wu.\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nHimax net revenues registered $207.6 million, a decrease of 8.8% sequentially, exceeding its\nguidance range of a 9% to 16% decline. Gross margin came in at 29.3%, outperforming the\nguidance of around 28.5%. Q1 profit per diluted ADS was 7.1 cents, surpassing the guidance\nrange of 2.0 cents to 5.0 cents.\nRevenue from large display drivers decreased 7.0% sequentially to $31.3 million due to\nseasonally soft macroeconomic conditions compounded by ongoing production and inventory\ncontrol measures by Company’s leading panel customers. Consequently, its sales of TV and\nmonitor ICs declined sequentially. However, notebook IC sales saw a nice double-digit\nincrease quarter-over-quarter, as customers accelerated their purchases after several\nquarters of destocking. Sales of large panel driver ICs accounted for 15.1% of total revenues\nfor the quarter, compared to 14.8% last quarter and 21.7% a year ago.\nSmall and medium-sized display driver revenue reached $144.3 million, a sequential decline\nof 11.5%. The better-than-guidance result was fueled by strong sales in DDIC for automotive\nand OLED tablets. Driven by rush orders for traditional DDIC, Q1 automotive driver sales,\nencompassing both traditional DDIC and TDDI, experienced a single-digit decline,\noutperforming the guidance of a mid-teens decline. Meanwhile, automotive TDDI sales\ncontinued to defy the industry downturn and increased sequentially thanks to Company’s\nrobust pipeline of design-win projects. The automotive business, including traditional DDIC,\nTDDI, Tcon, and OLED sales, remained the largest revenue contributor in the first quarter,\nrepresenting around 46% of total sales. Q1 smartphone IC sales declined sequentially but\nexceeded guidance, fueled by rush orders from leading customers. Conversely, tablet driver\nsales declined as expected amidst the typical low season characterized by sluggish demand.\nThe small and medium-sized driver IC segment accounted for 69.5% of total sales for the\nquarter, compared to 71.6% in the previous quarter and 63.3% a year ago.\nFirst quarter revenues from its non-driver business exceeded guidance, reaching $32.0\nmillion, an increase of 3.4% from the previous quarter. The better-than-expected\nperformance is attributable to a resurgence in orders for large-sized display Tcon products.\nIn the realm of automotive Tcon, the adoption of Company’s automotive local dimming Tcon\n2\ncontinues to rapidly expand, as evidenced by increasing number of project awards from\nnumerous Tier-1s for the new vehicle projects of their OEM customers around the world.\nThis sets the stage for robust sales growth in the coming years. Non-driver products\naccounted for 15.4% of total revenues, as compared to 13.6% in the previous quarter and\n15.0% a year ago.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter were $50.7 million, a decrease of 3.1% from the\nprevious quarter and a decline of 0.6% from a year ago. Given the persistent macroeconomic\nheadwinds, Himax continues to be diligent with strict budget and expense control measures.\nQ1 operating income was $10.0 million or 4.8% of sales, compared to 7.2% of sales for the\nsame period last year and 7.3% of sales last quarter. The decreases in operating margin were\nprimarily driven by lower sales. The sequential decrease was also attributed to lower gross\nmargin. However, Q2 gross margin is on track to rebound from Q1. First-quarter after-tax\nprofit was $12.5 million, or 7.1 cents per diluted ADS, compared to $23.6 million, or 13.5 cents\nper diluted ADS last quarter, and $14.9 million, or 8.5 cents per diluted ADS in the same period\nlast year.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nHimax had $277.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets at the end of\nMarch 2024, compared to $223.8 million at the same time last year and $206.4 million a\nquarter ago. The increase in cash balance stemmed primarily from continuous destocking\nefforts across all major product lines. In Q2, however, cash, cash equivalents, and other\nfinancial assets are set to decline primarily due to decreasing sales in the previous two\nquarters resulting in lower Q1 receivables. In addition, accounts payable is expected to\nincrease as a result of rising Q1 wafer orders placed in preparation for higher shipment\nvolume starting in Q2. Other significant Q2 cash outflows include annual income tax\npayments as well as refunds to certain customers for deposits made during the industry-\nwide capacity supply shortage. As of the end of the first quarter, Company had $39.0 million\nin long-term unsecured loans, of which $6.0 million was the current portion.\nThe Company’s inventories as of March 31, 2024 were $201.9 million, lower than $217.3\nmillion last quarter, yet another illustration of Company’s successful destocking efforts.\nAccounts receivable at the end of March 2024 was $212.3 million, down from $235.8 million\nlast quarter and down from $252.2 million a year ago. DSO was 93 days at the quarter end, as\ncompared to 91 days last quarter and 93 days a year ago. First quarter capital expenditures\nwere $2.7 million, versus $15.1 million last quarter and $2.8 million a year ago. The first\nquarter capex was mainly for R&D related equipment and in-house testers of Himax’s IC\ndesign business.\nPrior to today’s call, Himax announced an annual cash dividend of 29.0 cents per ADS, totaling\n$51 million and payable on July 12, 2024, with a payout ratio of 100% of the previous year's\nprofit. The high payout ratio is supported by Himax’s positive business outlook, as it pursues\nits business objectives and strives for sustainable long-term growth and shareholder value\nwhile maintaining a healthy balance sheet.\n3\nOutstanding Share\nAs of March 31, 2024, Himax had 174.7 million ADS outstanding, unchanged from last quarter.\nOn a fully diluted basis, the total number of ADS outstanding for the first quarter was 175.0\nmillion.\nQ2 2024 Outlook\nAmid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, customer behavior in the display market remains\nconservative with panel makers continuing to implement strict output control measures\namidst the cautious end brand panel procurement environment. Given the limited visibility,\ncustomers tend to maintain lean inventory levels and underestimate demand, thereby\nproviding Company with conservative forecasts, accompanied by last-minute order increases.\nThis trend has persisted over the past seven consecutive quarters, including Q1, with\nCompany’s actual sales consistently at the upper end of or exceeding its guidance range. As\nHimax looks ahead to the second half, even with lean inventory levels, Company anticipates\nthis conservative market sentiment will persist, causing customers to continue to prioritize\nagility in response to market dynamics. With that being said, Company believes Q1 will be the\nlow point for this year and sees sales starting to pick up in Q2, especially in the automotive\nsector. With several other upcoming demand catalysts on the horizon, including major\nsporting events and festival shopping seasons, business momentum is expected to continue\nto steadily improve throughout the second half.\nOn the update of the near-term outlook for automotive business, Himax’s largest source of\nrevenues. While many semiconductor vendors and their customers are still going through\npainstaking destocking processes, Company’s inventory position for automotive sector has\nbecome healthy since the end of last year with its panel customers also maintaining low stock\nlevels at present. This is best illustrated by the large quantities of rush orders Company\nreceived from panel customers over the last two months, for which it also had to place rush\norders to Company’s foundry vendors. Therefore, notwithstanding the recent headwinds\nfaced by the global automotive industry, Himax’s outlook for the automotive display IC\nbusiness remains positive for the second half of the year.\nThe automotive display market is experiencing a megatrend of expanding quantities, sizes,\nand sophistication of displays within vehicles as fancy displays are increasingly becoming a\nmajor selling point for car makers. As the leader in the automotive display IC business, Himax\nis poised to benefit from this trend, which implies higher content value per vehicle for display\nsemiconductor vendors such as us, leading to sustainable growth slated for the next few years.\nCompany’s confidence stems from its dominant design-win pipelines in TDDI and local\ndimming Tcon, both relatively new and cutting-edge technologies for automotive displays\nwith accelerating volume, a momentum which is expected to carry on over the next few years.\nThis will further solidify its position in the market where Company is already the leader in the\ntraditional DDIC. Moreover, more customers are adopting Himax’s local dimming Tcon, along\nwith TDDI or LTDI, as an integral part of their development platform for crafting new\nautomotive displays, reflecting strong customer loyalty for Himax’s technology and service.\nAdditionally, Company is implementing cost optimization and supplier diversification\nstrategies to enhance supply flexibility and cost-effectiveness, as exemplified by its recent\nstrategic partnership announced with Nexchip for the automotive market.\nHimax just declared its annual cash dividend with a payout ratio of 100% of last year’s profit.\nCompany’s decision for the high dividend payout ratio this year underscores its unwavering\n4\ncommitment to shareholder value, even in the face of uncertain macroeconomic conditions.\nThis not only recognizes the ongoing support of Company’s shareholders but also\ndemonstrates Company’s confidence in its financial stability.\nDisplay Driver IC Businesses\nLDDIC\nIn Q2 2024, Himax anticipates a mid-teens sequential increase in large display driver IC\nrevenue, primarily bolstered by customer restocking following several quarters of muted\ndemand, as well as increasing orders from customers preparing for the upcoming shopping\nfestivals. Q2 TV and monitor IC sales are expected to increase single digit and nice double\ndigit, respectively, quarter over quarter. In contrast, notebook IC sales are poised for a\ndecline following strong restocking in the previous quarter.\nIn the notebook market, a burgeoning trend of AI PC is emerging, prompting demand for\ndisplay upgrades to include touch-enabled features and/or adoption of OLED displays. Himax\noffers comprehensive offerings in both LCD and OLED technologies, encompassing DDIC,\nTcon, and touch-related products. Look ahead to 2025, the anticipated beginning of\nreplacement cycles, Himax is well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity with\nnumerous in-cell TDDI projects for mainstream LCD notebooks and DDIC and touch\ncontroller for OLED notebooks, some of which poised to enter mass production for leading\nbrands in the second half of this year. Himax believes this will serve as an important growth\ncatalyst for the Company in notebook and elevate its presence in the market.\nSMDDIC\nQ2 SMDDIC revenue is expected to increase single digit sequentially. Automotive IC revenue\nis expected to grow high teens sequentially, with sales for both DDIC and TDDI poised for\nsequential growth, despite recent reports of softening electric vehicle demand. Himax’s\nleadership position in automotive TDDI remains solid, underscored by the rapidly expanding\nadoption as demonstrated by more than 450 secured design-win projects, and a continuous\ninflux of new pipeline and design wins across the board. It’s also important to note that only\napproximately 30% of awarded projects are currently in mass production, as an indication of\nthe potential lucrative growth opportunity Himax believes is yet to be realized. Automotive\nTDDI sales are anticipated to represent more than 40% of total automotive driver sales in\nQ2. In contrast, both smartphone and tablet sales are projected to decline quarter over\nquarter, as consumers prolong their replacement cycles in response to the challenging\neconomic environment. To mitigate these sluggish conditions, Himax has taken steps to\nimprove its cost structure by diversifying its supplier base, to position Himax for a\nresurgence in demand.\nTo elaborate further on automotive IC business, where Himax has more than 40% market\nshare. Himax offers the industry's most comprehensive LCD product lineup, which includes\ntraditional DDIC and TDDI technologies alongside cutting-edge LTDI and local dimming Tcon\nsolutions. Moreover, Company is actively expanding and bolstering its footprint in OLED with\na comprehensive range of products, covering DDIC, Tcon, and on-cell touch controller while\nforming strategic alliances with top panel manufacturers in Korea and China. This proactive\napproach aligns Company with the dynamic transformation of the industry towards\nincreasing adoption of OLED displays for high end vehicles. The inherent flexibility of OLED\ndisplays to cater to foldable or curved shapes, along with Company’s outstanding visual\n5\nperformance and low power consumption, opens new horizons for automotive interior\ndisplays. Notably, Company’s meticulously engineered OLED on-cell touch controller sets a\nnew standard as it boasts an industry-leading touch signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 45 dB\nand offers heightened sensitivity, accommodating challenging user conditions such as glove-\nwearing and wet finger operations.\nHimax’s comprehensive solutions in automotive LCD and OLED displays address a broad\nspectrum of customer preferences and requirements, nurturing robust customer loyalty and\nfostering collaborations with global panel makers, Tier 1 suppliers, and automobile\nmanufacturers. Company anticipates its automotive business will remain a significant\ncatalyst for its growth moving forward.\nOn OLED, Company has made significant progress in providing solutions for automotive OLED\ndisplays, an area with exciting growth potential. Himax is expanding into other OLED\napplications such as tablet, notebook, and monitor, through collaborations with leading panel\nmanufacturers in Korea and China featuring a comprehensive offering, covering DDIC, Tcon,\nand touch controllers. Additional products with new feature enhancements are slated to enter\nmass production in the second half of 2024. Regarding smartphone OLED, the current\nslowdown in smartphone market demand has unfortunately necessitated adjustments to\nCompany’s initial timeline. Nonetheless, collaborations with customers in Korea and China\npersist, with ongoing verification and partnership projects.\nNon-Driver Product Categories\nTiming Controller (Tcon)\nThe Company anticipates a notable sequential increase of more than 40% in Tcon sales in Q2,\npropelled by escalating shipments for Tcon in large-sized displays and automotive. Himax has\nbeen devoted to developing panel driver ICs and timing controllers for decades. Company\nstands as the industry leader in both monitor and automotive Tcons, universally adopted by\nleading panel makers across the board. In the monitor Tcon sector, Himax excels in the high-\nend market, especially in gaming, where intricate designs are required for high resolution,\nhigh refresh rate, and low latency display performance, crucial for achieving immersive\ngaming and entertainment experiences.

The launch of production-ready WiseEye Modules exemplifies this\nbusiness model\nTAINAN, Taiwan – February 6, 2024 – Himax Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: HIMX) (“Himax” or\n“Company”), a leading supplier and fabless manufacturer of display drivers and other\nsemiconductor products, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year\n2023 ended December 31, 2023.\n“Traditionally, business operations in the first quarter decelerate due to the Lunar New Year\nholidays. This year, exacerbated conditions due to sluggish demand are causing panel makers\nto strategically lower factory utilizations, in an attempt to support panel pricing and\nprofitability. In tandem, OEMs and end customers are maintaining their cautious approach\nwith heightened procurement scrutiny, even with inventories now at more manageable levels.\nTo fortify the resilience of our operations, we are actively implementing strategies to optimize\ncosts and diversify suppliers in both foundries and backend sources to enhance supply\nflexibility and cost-effectiveness,” said Mr. Jordan Wu, President and Chief Executive Officer\nof Himax.\n“In addition, our recent presence at CES provided a comprehensive outlook on our strategic\nfocus for the upcoming years, covering automotive, WiseEye AI and optical technologies.\nDriven by accelerating growth in our automotive segment and expansion beyond our core\ndriver business, we are well positioned for sustainable long-term revenue growth and\nprofitability. Furthermore, our automotive, WiseEye, and LCoS product lines have attracted a\nstrong global client base, which significantly extends our reach and strengthens our presence\nin markets worldwide while diversifying regional exposure and adding stability to our\noperations,” concluded Mr. Jordan Wu.\nFourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results\nHimax net revenues registered $227.7 million, a decrease of 4.5% sequentially, but exceeding\nguidance range of a 5.0% to 11.0% decline. Gross margin came in at 30.3%, within guidance\nrange of around 30%, but down from 31.4% last quarter. Q4 profit per diluted ADS was 13.5\ncents, surpassing the guidance range of 9.0 cents to 13.0 cents.\nRevenue from large display drivers was $33.6 million, reflecting a sequential decrease of\n23.1%. This decline was predominantly driven by the prevailing weak macroeconomic\nconditions amidst the traditional peak seasonality in the fourth quarter. Q4 TV IC sales\ndeclined mid-teens sequentially due to ongoing strict production and inventory control\nmeasures of leading customers. Monitor and notebook IC sales both declined double-digit\nquarter-over-quarter, caused by a slowdown in order momentum as customers pulled\nforward their inventory purchases during the prior quarter. Sales of large panel driver ICs\naccounted for 14.8% of total revenues for the quarter, compared to 18.3% last quarter and\n16.6% a year ago.\nSmall and medium-sized display driver revenue was reached $163.1 million, a sequential\nincrease of 1.2%. This was underpinned by outperforming sales particularly in the TDDI\nproducts for automotive and tablet markets. Q4 automotive driver sales, combining both\n2\ntraditional DDIC and TDDI, experienced a slight decline following robust order restocking in\nboth during the third quarter. However, Q4 automotive TDDI sales still increased high teens\nsequentially, bucking the industry downturn thanks to Company’s solid pipeline of design-\nwin projects. Meanwhile, Himax’s industry leading, cutting-edge automotive LTDI product\nstarted mass production for Geely Auto’s NEVs in the third quarter of 2023. Taken together,\nthis not only solidifies Himax’s leadership in next-generation automotive displays, but also\nreflects the robust market demand for advanced display technology. Fourth quarter\nautomotive business, encompassing drivers, automotive Tcon and OLED sales, continued to\nbe its largest revenue contributor at over 45% of total sales. For tablet, Q4 sales grew high\nteens sequentially, exceeding guidance, driven by successful new product launches by\ncustomers during the quarter. Conversely, smartphone driver sales declined as expected\namidst a subdued festival season characterized by sluggish demand. The small and medium-\nsized driver IC segment accounted for 71.6% of total sales for the quarter, compared to\n67.6% in the previous quarter and a year ago.\nFourth quarter revenues from its non-driver business also exceeded guidance with revenue\nof $31.0 million but declined 8.2% from a quarter ago. The better-than-expected\nperformance is attributable to a resurgence in orders for Tcon product line. Adoption of\nHimax’s automotive local dimming Tcon is rapidly expanding, as evidenced by hundreds of\nproject awards across the board. This paves the way for robust growth in the coming years,\nmirroring the success seen in Himax’s automotive TDDI. Non-driver products accounted for\n13.6% of total revenues, as compared to 14.1% in the previous quarter and 15.8% a year\nago.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter were $52.3 million, a decrease of 17.9% from the\nprevious quarter and roughly flat compared to a year ago. The substantial sequential decrease\nwas caused mainly by decreased annual bonus and salary expenses, partially offset by an\nincrease in R&D expenses. Company’s standard practice of granting annual bonuses, including\ncash and RSUs, at the end of September each year, can lead to higher IFRS operating expenses\nin the third quarter compared to other quarters of the year. Amidst prevailing macroeconomic\nheadwinds, Himax is currently exercising strict budget and expense control with full year 2023\nOPEX declining 4.0% compared to the year before.\nQ4 operating income was $16.7 million or 7.3% of sales, compared to 10.5% of sales for the\nsame period last year and 4.6% of sales last quarter. The sequential increase was primarily a\nresult of lower operating expenses from lower annual bonus compensation, partially offset by\ndecreased sales and gross margin in the fourth quarter. The year-over-year decrease was\nprimarily a result of lower sales and gross margin compared to the same period last year.\nFourth quarter after-tax profit was $23.6 million, or 13.5 cents per diluted ADS, compared to\n$11.2 million, or 6.4 cents per diluted ADS last quarter and $42.2 million, or 24.1 cents in the\nsame period last year. It’s worth noting that the favorable after-tax profit exceeding operating\nincome reflects the positive tax adjustments made to rectify overestimated tax expenses for\npreceding quarters this year. As a reminder and for the purpose of year-over-year comparison,\nHimax made a divestiture of long-term assets during Q4 2022, resulting in a non-operating\nincome of around $11 million on an after-tax basis.\nFull Year 2023 Financial Results\nRevenues totaled $945.4 million, reflecting a 21.3% decline compared to 2022. Persistent\nsubdued global demand, coupled with looming recession concerns, presented significant\nchallenges to Himax’s operations throughout 2023. These market dynamics adversely affected\nboth demand and procurement processes of panel customers, particularly in the realm of\n3\nconsumer electronics. Yet, Himax’s optimism in the automotive business remains steadfast as\nautomotive TDDI sales witnessed a remarkable surge of over 50%, reflecting the resilience and\npotential of Company’s largest business segment.\nRevenue from large panel display drivers totaled $175.7 million in 2023, marking a decrease\nof 33.5% year-over-year, and representing 18.6% of total sales, as compared to 22.0% in 2022.\nSmall and medium-sized driver sales totaled $629.2 million, reflecting a decrease of 19.2%\nyear-over-year, and accounting for 66.5% of total revenues, as compared to 64.8% in 2022.\nNon-driver product sales totaled $140.5 million, a decrease of 11.2% year-over-year, and\nrepresenting 14.9% of total sales, as compared to 13.2% a year ago.\nInventory management also presented unique challenges for Himax throughout the sluggish\ndemand environment this year. To navigate these circumstances, Company’s primary\nobjectives were the strategic depletion of excess inventory while also tactically controlling\nCompany’s wafer starts. Following quarters of aggressive destocking, which often involved\nsacrificing short-term gross margin, inventory decreased to near historical norms by end of\n2023. The remaining stocks feature promising customer design-ins and long product life cycles\nthat lay the groundwork for a more stable outlook in 2024.\nGross margin in 2023 was 27.9%, decreasing from 40.5% in 2022. As a reminder, in Q2, the\nCompany strategically terminated high-cost foundry capacity agreements, leading to a\ndepressed Q2 gross margin of just 21.7%. Despite the temporary margin contraction, this\ndecision liberates new wafer starts from minimum fulfillment constraints while positioning\nHimax to capitalize on a turnaround in demand.\nOperating expenses in 2023 were $220.3 million, a decline of 4.0% from 2022, primarily a\nresult of the lower vested portion of the annual bonus compensation awarded to employees\nin 2023 and preceding years, partially offset by increased salaries and R&D expenses. 2023\noperating income was $43.2 million, or 4.6% of sales, a decrease from $257.6 million, or 21.4%\nof sales, in 2022. Net profit for 2023 was $50.6 million, or $0.29 per diluted ADS, as compared\nto $237.0 million, or $1.36 per diluted ADS in 2022.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nHimax had $206.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets as of December\n31, 2023. This compares to $229.9 million at the same time last year and $155.4 million a\nquarter ago. Himax achieved a strong positive operating cash flow of $68.7 million for the\nfourth quarter, a result of the substantial reduction in inventory across major product lines.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Himax had $40.5 million in long-term unsecured loans, with $6.0\nmillion representing the current portion.\nThe Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2023 were $217.3 million, lower than $259.6\nmillion last quarter and $370.9 million at the end of last year. Inventory level has declined\nsteadily over the last five quarters and reached a healthy level by the end of 2023. Accounts\nreceivable at the end of December 2023 was $235.8 million, a decline from $248.5 million last\nquarter and down from $261.1 million a year ago. DSO was 91 days at the quarter end, as\ncompared to 95 days last quarter and 79 days a year ago. Fourth quarter capital expenditures\nwere $15.1 million, versus $2.6 million last quarter and $2.3 million a year ago. Fourth quarter\ncapex was mainly allocated to in-house testers for IC design business, in addition to other R&D\nrelated equipment. Total capital expenditures for 2023 were $23.4 million as compared to\n$11.8 million in 2022.\n4\nOutstanding Share\nAs of December 31, 2023, Himax had 174.7 million ADS outstanding, unchanged from last\nquarter. On a fully diluted basis, the total number of ADS outstanding for the fourth quarter\nwas 175.0 million.\nQ1 2024 Outlook\nTraditionally, business operations in the first quarter decelerate due to the Lunar New Year\nholidays. This year, exacerbated conditions due to sluggish demand are causing panel makers\nto strategically lower factory utilizations, in an attempt to support panel pricing and\nprofitability. In tandem, OEMs and end customers are maintaining their cautious approach\nwith heightened procurement scrutiny, even with inventories now at more manageable levels.\nThis shift has resulted in shortened forecasts and more frequent last-minute orders, ultimately\nconstraining Company’s visibility, particularly in consumer electronics products.\nTo fortify the resilience of Company’s operations, Himax is actively implementing strategies\nto optimize costs and diversify suppliers in both foundries and backend sources to enhance\nsupply flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

          "content": "Dear Shareholders,\nIn 2023, Himax faced a host of challenges, primarily stemming from lingering subdued global demand\ncoupled with cautious procurement practices among end brands and stringent controls by panel makers\nresulting in a revenue decline and gross margin contraction. In the face of this adversity, we made difficult\nbut necessary strategic decisions to position the company for future success. One such key decision was\nto terminate certain high-cost foundry capacity agreements in second quarter of 2023. By sacrificing short-\nterm gross margin through a one-time significant expense, we enhanced our cost competitiveness, added\nflexibility through supplier diversification and liberated new wafer starts from minimum fulfillment\nconstraints, positioning us to capitalize on a potential turnaround in demand. Additionally, we\nimplemented aggressive inventory destocking measures, which yielded encouraging results, successfully\nreducing inventory to near-historical average levels by the end of the year. The remaining stocks are\ncomprised of IC products with a solid customer design-in base and long expected lifetimes.\nTurning to some of our key 2023 highlights.\nFirst, in the automotive sector, our primary revenue contributor, we continue to dominate the market with\nthe most comprehensive product lineup for display semiconductor technologies, ranging from traditional\nDDIC and TDDI, to cutting-edge LTDI and local dimming Tcon for LCD panel, and extending into\nAMOLED display solutions. We are particularly optimistic about the growth trajectory in this market\ndriven by the increasing trend toward sophisticated displays in vehicles, encompassing greater quantities,\nsizes and functionalities. Our 2023 automotive TDDI sales surged by over 50% year over year, showcasing\nthe resilience of this market segment where we command a dominant position. Looking ahead, we expect\nstrong growth in our automotive TDDI and local dimming Tcon, backed by hundreds of secured design-\nwins slated for mass production within the next two years. This will reinforce our leading market position\namidst growing competition. Our automotive business is set to contribute to over 40% of our total sales\nin 2024, further bolstering our revenues and gross margin.\nNext in the AI domain, Himax remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing our WiseEye product\nline in the realm of end-point applications, where we have achieved industry-leading ultralow power\nconsumption and AI inference performance. Our award winning WiseEye2 AI processor, progressively\nadvancing its market-leading predecessor WiseEye1, is pioneering a new standard in endpoint AI\nbenchmarks, earning recognition for its outstanding AI inference capability, industry-leading ultralow\npower and advanced security features. WiseEye2 offers enhanced content-aware AI features such as face\nmesh, facial landmark, hand gesture, and human pose and skeleton, expanding the intuitive, user-friendly\nscope of interactive applications in real-life, all achieved with minimal power consumption. Additionally,\nwe continue to expand our plug-and-play WiseEye Module offering and collaborate with ecosystem\npartners to broaden WiseEye’s market reach. The modules unveil a spectrum of easy-to-adopt AI solutions\nthat incorporate advanced no-code/low-code AI models to meet diverse needs and facilitate seamless\nsystem integration. This lowers the entry barrier and cost for customers’ AI development, enabling them\nto promptly seize opportunities in the burgeoning field of end point AI.\nLastly on AMOLED, another key exciting area for us, where we are actively cultivating strategic\npartnerships with leading panel manufacturers in Korea and China across various applications, including\nautomotive, tablets, notebooks, and smartphones. Himax’s AMOLED portfolio, which comprises DDIC\nand Tcon, now extends to on-cell touch controllers, enabling a comprehensive solution offering. Notably,\n1\nin notebook segment, we unveiled industry-leading on-cell AMOLED touch controllers, aiming to further\nbolster our presence as customers increasingly adopt touch features and AMOLED displays for product\nupgrade and differentiation. In the automotive segment, our newly launched AMOLED touch controller\nIC boasts an industry-leading touch signal-to-noise ratio, delivering superior performance even in\nchallenging conditions such as glove-wearing and wet finger operations, all without compromising display\nquality. We expect to expand our presence in the OLED field with projects slated for mass production\nstarting in the second half of 2024.\nLooking ahead, we are well-positioned to sustain secular growth trends leveraging the strength of key\nstrategic pillars in place including our automotive leadership, enhanced operational flexibility, and a\ncommitment to high-value areas such as Tcon, OLED and AI, alongside optical solutions for\nmetaverse/AR/VR applications. Importantly, these product lines enjoy higher gross margins than our\ncorporate average with some already securing a leading position in their respective markets.

Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\n3.C. Reason for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n3.D. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation, which could result\nin an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.\nThere may be industry consolidation among our suppliers. Merger and acquisition activities will likely increase\nthe size and market power of the relevant suppliers and reduce the number of suppliers we could use under a simpler\nsupplier chain. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer contract terms,\nhigher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could result in an\nincrease in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. If we are unable to transfer any increase in average unit\ncost to our customers, our gross margin and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD and OLED panel industry, which is\nhighly cyclical and subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact\nour business or results of operations.\nIn 2022 and 2023, 86.8% and 85.1% of our revenues, respectively, were attributable to display drivers that were\nincorporated into TFT-LCD and OLED panels. We expect to continue to substantially depend on sales to the\nTFT-LCD and OLED panel industry for the foreseeable future. The TFT-LCD and OLED panel industry is intensely\ncompetitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD and OLED\npanels generally decline with time as a result of, among other factors, drop in demand for end products that\nincorporate TFT LCD and OLED panels, new capacity ramp-up or factory utilization improvement, technological\nadvancements and cost reduction with the exception of the new high end and high-resolution products.\nThe merger of certain of our major customers could result in an increase in their bargaining power and therefore\nsubject us to additional downward pricing pressure. We cannot assure you that in such periods in which we\nexperience significant downward pricing pressure, we could sufficiently reduce costs to completely offset the loss of\nrevenues. In addition, a severe and prolonged industry downturn could also result in higher risks to the collectability\nof our accounts receivable, the marketability and valuation of inventories, the impairment of our long-term\nnon-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and the stability of our\nsupply chain. As a result, the cyclicality of the TFT-LCD and OLED panel industry could adversely affect our\nrevenues, cost of revenues and results of operations.\n10\nOur strategy of expanding our product offerings to non-driver products may not be successful.\nWe have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, financial and management resources to non-driver products’\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing to further diversify our product portfolio and improve gross margin as\nnon-driver products may have higher gross margin than our driver products. Our non-driver technologies cover\nTiming controller (TCON), LCoS microdisplay, CMOS image sensor, wafer level optics (“WLO”), 3D sensing and\nultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing, etc.\nWe offer TCON for large sized TV and monitor displays, automotive display and AMOLED panels. For our\nLCoS technology, at present our main focus areas for LCoS business are AR goggle devices, projectors and\nhead-up-displays (HUD) for automotive. For CMOS image sensor business, in addition to the current shipment for\nhuman vision applications, including notebook, multimedia and smart home cameras, we also extend the sensor\nbusiness in machine vision application for the broad AI market. Our AoS CMOS image sensor is designed with\nproprietary architectures, readout, and pixel, where the corresponding algorithms are integrated to contribute the\nalways-on feature that consumes only several micro watts to enable people detection, eyeball tracking and many\nother features. On 3D sensing business, we focus on Structured Light and ToF 3D module solution and 3D decoder\nASIC key component, aiming at emerging markets such as facial recognition-based e-payment, business access\ncontrol, biomedical inspection device, 3D naked-eye display, eye-tracking, and hand gesture control applications.\nFor our ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing business, we focus on providing leading end-point AI\nsolutions, in both total solution and discrete key component, to meet diversified customer and application needs.\nHimax’s ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing solution integrates in-house AoS sensor, ultralow power AI\nprocessor and CNN-based AI algorithm from in house or third-party algorithm partners. Our WiseEye AI solution\nhad already been adopted by one global leading notebook vendor and went into mass production from early 2022.\nWe also see growing adoption of our WiseEye technology in a broad range of applications, covering shared bike\nparking, automotive, door lock, battery-powered surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing, and medical\ncapsule endoscope among others. Some of these applications already commenced production since 2022. As we\nfocus on scaling adoption in this relatively untapped market, we also collaborate closely with numerous AI\necosystem partners and communities as well as system integration companies to make our AI solution more diverse\nand accessible. Progress has been made in areas such as notebook, smart city / home / office, surveillance,\nhealthcare, smart agriculture and smart retail. Himax is more committed than ever to strengthening the Company’s\nWiseEye product roadmap and retaining the leadership position in ultralow power AI processor and image sensor\nfor end-point AI applications.\nDeveloping and commercializing each of our non-driver products requires a significant amount of management,\nengineering and monetary resources. For example, we have established certain in-house facilities for key\nmanufacturing processes of our non-driver products including LCoS microdisplay, WLO and 3D sensing. Numerous\nuncertainties exist in developing new products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our\nnon-driver products successfully. We may underestimate the amount of capital, personnel and other resources\nrequired to develop and commercialize our non-driver products. We may also overestimate the market potential of\nthe end products that are utilizing or will utilize our non-driver products. The failure or delay in the development,\nproduction or commercialization of any of our non-driver products, the occurrence of any product defects or design\nflaws, or the low market acceptance of or demand for either of our products or the end devices using our products\nmay adversely affect the impairment of our long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets, for non-driver products, our results of operations and growth prospects. The lower\ncapacity utilization rate of our factories will negatively affect our gross margin and our results of operations.\nMoreover, we will be subject to higher ramp-up expenses in the early stage of mass production of our non-driver\nproducts.\nThe concentration of our revenues and accounts receivable and the extension of payment terms for certain of\nour customers exposes us to increased credit risk and could harm our operating results and cash flows.\nIn 2023, Customer A and its affiliates accounted for 28.7% of our revenues. Our two largest customers together\naccounted for over 39% of our revenues in 2023. See “Item 5.A. Operating Results—Description of Certain\nStatements of Profit or Loss Line Items—Revenues” for our revenues description. Our results of operations and\nfinancial condition would be significantly linked to the success and purchase policy of any such customer. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, our accounts receivable from Customer A and its affiliates were $67.1 million, which\nrepresented approximately 28.5% of our accounts receivable, net. The concentration of our accounts receivable\nexposes us to increased credit risk. Moreover, we have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of\nour customers. As a result, any loss of or a sharp reduction in any such customer’s sales, a default by any such\n11\ncustomer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable or the extension of payment terms for our\ncustomers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and operating results.\nOur customers may experience a decline in profitability or may not be profitable at all, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nPanel Manufacturers, including our customers, experience significant pressure on prices and profit margins, due\nlargely to growing industry capacity and fluctuations in demand for TFT-LCD and OLED panels. Some panel\nmanufacturers have greater access to capital or greater production, research and development, intellectual property,\nmarketing or other resources than our customers, who may not be able to compete and sustain their market positions.\nFurther, our customers’ business performance may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which\nare beyond their control, including and not limited to: (1) consumer demand and the general economic conditions,\nsuch as recent geopolitical tensions relating to invasion of Ukraine by Russia and China city lockdowns due to\nCovid mandates; (2) the cyclical nature of the TFT-LCD and OLED industry in average selling price fluctuations, as\nwell as its downstream industries; (3) the speed at which Panel Manufacturers expand production capacity; (4) brand\ncompanies’ continued needs for original equipment manufacturing services provided by Panel Manufacturers; (5)\naccess to raw materials, components, equipment and utilities on a timely and economical basis; (6) technological\nchanges; (7) the rescheduling and cancellation of large orders; (8) access to funding on satisfactory terms; and (9)\nfluctuations in the currencies of TFT-LCD and OLED panels exporting countries against the U.S. dollar.\nWe depend on sales of display drivers used in TFT-LCD and OLED panels, and the limited potential for\nfurther growth in both the market size of display drivers and the market share of our display drivers or the\nabsence of continued market acceptance of our display drivers could limit our growth in revenues or harm our\nbusiness.\nIn 2022 and 2023, 86.8% and 85.1% of our revenues, respectively, were from the sale of display drivers used\nfor large, small and medium-sized applications, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our\nrevenues from these or related products. As the display driver industry is relatively mature, there may be limited\npotential for the overall display drivers market to grow and for us to further grow our market share and revenues.\nFailure to grow our unit shipments for display drivers, coupled with a general decline in the average selling\nprices, could adversely and materially affect our results of operations. See also “—Risks Relating to Our\nIndustry—The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our\nrevenues and operating results”. Therefore, the continued market acceptance of our display drivers is critical to our\nfuture success. Failure to grow or maintain our revenues generated from the sales of display drivers could adversely\nand materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to public health epidemics, including the novel coronavirus outbreaks.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic, such as\nthe global Covid-19 pandemic, interferes with our ability, or that of our employees, suppliers, customers and other\nbusiness partners to fulfill our and their respective responsibilities and obligations related to the conduct of our\nbusiness. The outbreak of Covid-19 has caused significant disruption not only to the financial markets but also to\nglobal supply chains, which can substantially depress global business activities, restrict access to capital and result in\na long-term economic downturn that would negatively affect our operating results.\nExtra export licenses may be needed for certain product or technology for certain customers. These licenses\nare regulated by Export Administration Regulations (EAR) which are administered by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).\nOur business is subject to various international laws and legal requirements from the U.S. Export\nAdministration Regulations and other jurisdictions’ applicable executive orders in packaging, product content, labor\nand import/export regulations, etc. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with\nlimited notice, have generally become more rigorous and have intensified under the current U.S. administration,\nespecially in recent geopolitical tensions with China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply\nwith, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations\nor our customers are sanctioned, or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may be required to suspend sales to\nthese customers, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf our foundry, tape, assembly and testing suppliers fail to comply with these regulations or our suppliers are\nsanctioned or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may suspend their services and have to obtain alternative\n12\nservices in a timely manner. Considering the amount of time, it usually takes to qualify assembly and testing houses,\nwe may experience significant delays in product shipments. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,\nquality or cost of our products could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover,\nthe scarcity and importance of services may necessitate us making investments in foundry, tape, assembly and\ntesting service providers in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital\noutlays and possibly raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nTechnological innovation may reduce the number of display drivers typically required for each panel, thereby\nreducing the number of display drivers we are able to sell per panel. If such a reduction in demand is not offset\nby the general growth of the industry, our market share or average selling prices, or our revenues may decline.\nIn order to reduce costs, Panel Manufacturers generally seek to have display drivers with higher channel counts\nand new panel designs to reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel. We have been developing\nsuch innovative and cost-effective display driver solutions in order to grow our market share, attract additional\ncustomers, increase our average selling prices and capture new design wins. However, we cannot assure you that we\nwill successfully achieve these goals. If we fail to do so and the number of display drivers typically required per\npanel decreases thereby reducing our unit shipments, our revenues may decline. Panel Manufacturers have\ndeveloped several panel designs to reduce the usage of display drivers, including gate in panel, or GIP, amorphous\nsilicon gate, or ASG, or simply gateless designs, which integrate the gate driver function onto the glass and\neliminate the need for gate drivers, as well as dual gate and triple gate panel designs, which would largely reduce the\nusage of source drivers. If such designs or technologies become widely adopted, demand for our display drivers may\ndecrease significantly, which would adversely and materially affect our results of operations. The strategic\nrelationships between certain of our competitors and their customers and the development of in-house capabilities by\nPanel Manufacturers may limit our ability to expand our customer base and our growth prospects.\nCertain of our competitors have established or may establish strategic or strong relationships with Panel\nManufacturers that are also our existing or potential customers. Marketing our display drivers to such Panel\nManufacturers that have established relationships with our competitors may be difficult. Moreover, several Panel\nManufacturers have in-house design capabilities and therefore may not need to source semiconductor products from\nus. If our customers successfully develop in-house capabilities to design and develop semiconductors that can\nsubstitute for our products, they would likely reduce or stop purchasing our products. To sell new products, we will\nlikely need to target new market segments and new customers with whom we do not have current relationships,\nwhich may require different strategies and may present difficulties that we have not encountered before. Failure to\nbroaden our customer base and attract new customers may limit our growth prospects.\nAs OLED offers brighter color, near-perfect-black, less power consumption and is thinner and lighter than\nTFT-LCD, it gradually penetrates the mid to high-end TFT-LCD market, especially the smartphone market. OLED\ndisplay and related DDICs have been dominated by Korean companies. The marketplace is increasing utilization of\nthe OLED display for smartphone and other electronics areas, including notebook, tablet, TV and automotive due to\nexpanded OLED capacity. We continue to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC development in partnership with\nmajor Chinese and Korean panel makers. For tablet, we are seeing adoptions on the rise for premium models that\nadopt advanced OLED display, of which Himax offers both DDIC and TCON and has commenced production to\ncertain leading brands. For automotive OLED display, we continue to win project awards for our flexible AMOLED\ndriver, TCON, and touch controller IC with both conventional car makers and EV/NEV vendors. Finally, we are\nmaking good progress with leading panel houses for the development of OLED display drivers for smartphone, TV\nand notebook applications. However, we could not assure you of the success of our AMOLED driver IC as we are\nunable to penetrate into the mass volume existing Korean and China supplier chain and/or find new OLED panel\nmanufactures to design-wins our solutions into. OLED process maturity for the new manufactures and the possible\nspecification change due to the immaturity of the OLED will also be a hurdle to our AMOLED driver share gain and\nsuccess.\nHimax’s solution for AMOLED includes driver ICs, TCON and touch controller ICs in automotive and tablet\nPC. In addition, there are multiple AMOLED projects under development jointly with worldwide leading panel\nmakers for other applications, including smart phones, TV, notebook PCs and many others. The growth momentum\nin AMOLED solution is promising, but the risk of high dependency on limited customer base amid current macro\nuncertainty might result in fluctuation in sales performance.\n13\nWe depend primarily on third-party foundries to manufacture our wafers, and any failure to obtain sufficient\nfoundry capacity or loss of any of the foundries we use could significantly delay our ability to ship our products,\ncausing us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nAccess to foundry capacity is crucial to our business because we do not manufacture our own wafers, instead\nrelying primarily on third-party foundries. The ability of a foundry to manufacture our semiconductor products is\nlimited by its available capacity. Access to capacity is especially important due to the limited availability of the\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology required for the manufacture of wafers used in display drivers. If the\nprimary third-party foundries that we rely upon are not able to meet our required capacity, or if our business\nrelationships with these foundries are adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity to\nmeet increasing demand for our products. We may have to seek alternative foundries, which may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or which may expose us to qualifying-new-foundry risks, as further discussed\nbelow.\nWe use several foundries for different semiconductor products, and certain of our products are manufactured at\nonly one of these foundries. If any one of the foundries is unable to provide the required capacity to us, or does not\ndeliver in a timely manner, or the quality or pricing terms are not acceptable to us, or any of the foundries\nexperience financial difficulties or insolvency risks due to the impact of the global economic turmoil or any\ncompany-specific reasons or otherwise, if their operations are damaged or if there is any other disruption, directly or\nindirectly, of their foundry operations and we cannot qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner, we could\nexperience significant delays in receiving the product being manufactured by that foundry or incur additional costs\nto obtain substitutes, or interruption in our supply of the affected products. If we choose to use a new foundry or\nprocess technology for a particular semiconductor product, it will take us several quarters to qualify the new foundry\nor process before we can begin shipping. If we cannot qualify a new foundry in a timely manner, we may experience\nand incur damages as above mentioned and harm our customer relationships.\nAs a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of our wafers, we face several significant risks, including: (1)\nfailure to secure manufacturing capacity, or being able to obtain required capacity only at higher costs; (2) risks of\nour proprietary information leaking to our competitors through the foundries we use; (3) limited control of delivery\nschedules, quality assurance and control, manufacturing yields and wafer costs; (4) the unavailability of, or potential\ndelays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and (5) financial risks of certain of our foundry suppliers.\nTo manufacture our display drivers used in TFT-LCD and OLED panels, we require foundries with\nhigh-voltage CMOS manufacturing process capacity. As a result, our dependence on high-voltage CMOS foundries\npresents the following, additional risks: (1) potential capacity constraints faced by the limited number of\nhigh-voltage CMOS foundries and the lack of investment in new and existing high-voltage CMOS foundries; (2)\ndifficulty in attaining consistently high manufacturing yields from high-voltage CMOS foundries; (3) delay and time\nrequired to qualify and ramp up production at new high-voltage CMOS foundries; and (4) price increases.\nAs a result, we may be required to use foundries with which we have no established relationships, which could\nexpose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover, the\nscarcity of high-voltage foundry capacity may necessitate us making investments in foundries in order to secure\ncapacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional capital,\nwhich may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe generally do not enter long-term agreements with our foundry partners that guarantee production capacity,\nprices, lead times, or delivery schedules. However, since 2020, due to the pandemic lockdown, the work-from-home\nand learn-from-home new lifestyles triggered increasing demands for display and display drivers related products.\nThe surging demand in display drivers caused the severe foundry capacity shortage, while the industry has no major\nexpansion plan especially on the mature nodes we are primarily anchored to. To address the potential foundry\ncapacity shortage worldwide, we had entered into strategic agreements with our foundry partners in order to secure\ncapacity to fulfill our business needs. Under these strategic agreements, we are committed to purchasing a specific\nvolume at fixed or variable prices. However, for both pricing agreements, there can be no assurance that these prices\nprovided in the strategic agreements with our foundry partners will always remain competitive during the contract\nterm. For example, in the event that the global semiconductor market changes due to foundry capacity expansion\nand/or shrunken customer demand, the fixed prices we agree to pay our foundry partners may become significantly\nhigher than the then prevailing market price. The situation could materially adversely impact our pricing strategies,\ncompetitive position, profitability and results of operation. We may also be subject to contractual penalties if we are\nunable to purchase the committed volume from our foundry partners. In addition, since these strategic agreements\n14\nwith our foundry partners typically require us to make prepayments or refundable deposits to such foundry partners,\nour cash flow, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to secure sufficient capacity from any of our third-party tape, assembly and testing houses at\nreasonable and competitive prices could disrupt our shipments, harm our customer relationships and reduce\nour sales.\nAccess to third-party tape, assembly and testing capacity is critical to our business because we do not have\nin-house tape, assembly and testing capabilities for commercial production and instead rely on third-party service\nproviders. Access to these services is especially important to our business because display drivers require\nspecialized tape, assembly and testing services. A limited number of third-party tape, assembly and testing houses\ntape, assemble and test substantially all of our current products. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to\nbargain for higher prices, longer contract terms, higher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their\nservices and products, which could result in an increase in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. If the\nprimary tape, assembly and testing service providers that we rely upon are not able to meet our requirements in price,\nquality, and service, or if our business relationships with these service providers were adversely affected, we would\nnot be able to obtain the required capacity and would have to seek alternative providers, which may not be available\non commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we do not directly control our product delivery schedules,\ntape, assembly and testing costs, and quality assurance and control. If any of these third-party tape, assembly and\ntesting houses experiences capacity constraints, financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities or if there is\nany disruption of its assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing\nservices in a timely manner. Because of the amount of time, we usually take to qualify assembly and testing houses,\nwe may experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative sources. Any\nproblems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our reputation and\nresult in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of tape, assembly and testing\nservices may necessitate us making investments in tape, assembly and testing service providers in order to secure\ncapacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional capital,\nwhich may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of key components for our customers’ products could decrease demand for our products.\nShortages of components and other materials that are critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’\nproducts may limit our sales. These components and other materials include, but are not limited to, color filters,\nbacklight modules, polarizers, printed circuit boards and glass substrates. In the past, companies that use our\nproducts in their production have experienced delays in the availability of key components from other suppliers. In\naddition, component manufacturers may not be able to increase or maintain their component supply because of labor\nshortage in China or otherwise and may shut down certain of their capacity from time to time because of weak\ndemand, which may increase the instability of timely delivery and the risk of shortage of components. Such\nshortages of components and other materials critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’ products may\ncause a slowdown in demand for our products, resulting in a decrease in our sales and adversely affecting our results\nof operations. In addition, as a result of uncertain demand conditions, our customers may hesitate to build inventory\non hand and tend to release orders on short notice.\nWe rely on the services of our key personnel, and if we are unable to retain our current key personnel and hire\nadditional personnel, our ability to design, develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\nWe rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key personnel, including\nJordan Wu, our president and chief executive officer, and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu, our chairman, and certain engineering,\ntechnical and senior management personnel, in particular, who are critical to our corporate management, business\noperation strategy, operation execution, future technological and product innovations. Competition for these\npersonnel is intense in the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. Moreover, our future success depends on the\nexpansion of our senior management team and the retention of key employees. Any of our key employees could\nleave our company with little or no prior notice in applicable jurisdictions and could then work with a competitor. In\naddition, we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any key\npersonnel or our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, whether engineers or others, could delay the\ndevelopment and introduction of new products and would have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our\nproducts and may impact our overall business and growth. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be\nrequired to divert the attention of other senior executives away from their original duties to recruiting replacements\nfor key personnel.\n15\nIf we fail to forecast customer demand accurately, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may\nincrease our operating costs and harm our business.\nThe lead time required by the semiconductor manufacturing service providers is typically longer than the lead\ntime that our customers provide for delivery of our products to them. To ensure availability of our products for our\ncustomers, we will typically ask our semiconductor manufacturing service providers to start manufacturing our\nproducts based on forecasts provided by our customers in advance of receiving their purchase orders. However,\nthese forecasts are not binding purchase commitments, and we do not recognize revenues until they are delivered to\ncustomers. Moreover, for the convenience of our customers, we may agree to ship our inventory to warehouses\nlocated near our customers, so that our products can be delivered to customers more quickly. In such cases, we will\nnot recognize revenues until the control over a product is given to our customers based on the shipping terms. Hence,\nwe incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenues.\nThe anticipated demand for our products may not materialize; therefore, manufacturing based on customer\nforecasts exposes us to risks such as high inventory carrying costs, increased product obsolescence, erosion of the\nproducts’ market value as well as penalties incurred from unfulfillment of committed orders from capacity\nagreements with the Company’s foundries and backend suppliers. If we overestimate demand for our products or if\npurchase orders are cancelled or shipments delayed, we may incur charges from agreements entered with foundries\nand backend suppliers for securing capacity, excess inventory that we cannot sell, or may have to sell at low profit\nmargins or even at a loss, which would harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may\nnot have sufficient inventory and may lose market share and damage customer relationships, which also could harm\nour business. These inventory risks are exacerbated by the high level of customization of our products, which limits\nour ability to sell excess inventory to other customers, which could eventually lead to write-down of these excess\ninventories.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future, our ability to grow will be limited.\nOur future success depends on our customers designing our products into their products. To achieve design\nwins, we must design and deliver cost-effective, innovative, reliable and integrated products for our customers’\nneeds. A panel manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs and\ntime associated with qualifying a new supplier. A design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to\npurchase our products and may not result in large volume orders of our products. Rather, it is a decision by a\ncustomer to use our products in the design process of that customer’s products. Accordingly, our failure to\nsuccessfully design, develop and introduce new products and product enhancements could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are complex and may require modifications to resolve undetected errors or failures in order for\nthem to function with panels at the desired specifications, which could lead to higher costs, customer dispute, a\nloss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain undetected errors or failures. Our products must operate\naccording to specifications with the other components used by our customers in their product manufacturing process.\nIf our products are delivered with errors or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement\ncosts, and our credibility and the market acceptance of our products could be harmed along with possible liability\nindemnification for defective product, customer disputes and lawsuits against us or our customers.\nOur highly integrated products are difficult to manufacture without defects. The existence of defects in our\nproducts could increase our costs, decrease our sales and damage our customer relationships and our\nreputation.\nThe manufacture of our products that incorporate mixed analog and digital signal processing and embedded\nmemory technology is complex and it is difficult for semiconductor foundries to manufacture them completely\nwithout defects. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process could cause substantial reduction in yield and\nquality.\nDefective products can be caused by design, defective materials or component parts, or manufacturing\ndifficulties. Thus, quality problems can be identified only by analyzing and testing our display drivers in a system\nafter they have been manufactured. Difficulties in achieving defect-free products due to the increasing complexity of\ndisplay drivers and the panel system may result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and delays in the\navailability of our products. In addition, if the foundries that we use fail to deliver products of satisfactory quality in\n16\nthe volume and at the price required, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand or to sell those products at\nan acceptable profit margin, which could adversely affect our sales and margins and damage our customer\nrelationships and our reputation.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant\nuncertainty and volatility with respect to our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers; our sales are made on the basis of\nindividual purchase orders. Our customers may also cancel or defer purchase orders. Our customers’ purchase orders\nmay vary significantly from period-to-period, and it is difficult to forecast future order quantities. In the event of a\ncancellation, postponement, or reduction of an order, we would likely not be able to reduce operating expenses\nsufficiently so as to minimize the impact of the lost revenues. Alternatively, subject to real ever-changing\ncircumstances over the periods, we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell, which would harm our operating\nresults. In addition, changes in our customers’ business may adversely affect the quantity of purchase orders that we\nreceive by reducing or canceling their orders of our products, and/or requesting higher-than-usual price concessions.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue to place purchase orders with us in the future. We also\ncannot assure you that the volume of our customers’ purchase orders will be consistent with our expectations when\nwe plan our expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition may thus be materially and adversely\naffected. Additionally, purchase order unissued, cancelations or negative alternation by customers may lead to a\nreduction in future earnings or cash flows subject to each event.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by officers, directors and affiliated entities who may take\nactions that are not in, or may conflict with, our or our public shareholders’ interests.\nAs of March 31, 2024, Jordan Wu and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu (who are brothers) beneficially owned approximately\n2.1% and 22.0% of our ordinary shares, respectively. For information relating to the beneficial ownership of our\nordinary shares, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” These\nshareholders, acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders,\nincluding electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of\nownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our\nshareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might\nreduce the price of our ADSs. Actions may be taken even if they were opposed by our other shareholders.\nAssertions against us by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights could result in\nsignificant costs and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights\nand positions, which results in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have received, and\nexpect to continue to receive, notices of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. We may receive\nclaims from various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty rights in the future. Any lawsuit resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for\ndamages and invalidate our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be\ntime-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential\nintellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: (1) desist and stop selling\nproducts or using technology or manufacturing processes that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property;\n(2) pay damages to the party claiming infringement; (3) attempt to obtain a license for the relevant intellectual\nproperty, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; and (4) attempt to redesign those\nproducts that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property with non-infringing intellectual property, which\nmay not be possible.\nThe outcome of a dispute may result in our need to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or\nlicensing agreements. We have to undertake the contractual obligations, product liabilities and tort liabilities in\napplicable law jurisdictions, and we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement\narising out of the sale of our products. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, operating results or financial condition.\n17\nOur ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the\nsuccess of our business. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyright laws\nand contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual properties. These afford only limited protection. Despite our\nefforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain, copy or use information that we\nregard as proprietary, such as product design and manufacturing process expertise. Our pending patent applications\nand any future applications may not result in issued patents or may not be sufficiently broad to protect our\nproprietary technologies. Moreover, policing any unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we\ncannot be certain that the measures which we have implemented will prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use\nof our technologies, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as\nfully as the laws of the United States. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual\nproperties or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual properties. Our failure to protect our\nintellectual properties effectively could harm our business.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or investments to expand our business that may pose risks to our business and\ndilute the ownership of our existing shareholders, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these\nacquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire\nor invest in other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings,\nexpand the breadth of markets we can address or enhance our technical capabilities. Acquisitions or investments that\nwe have completed or potentially may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and\nadversely affect our business, operating and financial results, including: (1) problems integrating the acquired key\nemployees, operations, technologies or products into our existing business and products; (2) diversion of\nmanagement’s time and attention from our core business; (3) adverse effects of losses of the acquired target upon\nour financial condition and results of operations; (4) adverse effects on existing business relationships with\ncustomers; (5) the need for financial resources above our planned investment levels; (6) dilution of share ownership\nof current shareholders under share swap transactions; (7) risks associated with entering markets in which we lack\nexperience; (8) potential write-offs of acquired assets; and (9) potential impairment charges related to the goodwill\nacquired.\nWe may also face challenges in international acquisitions, such as compliance with local law and regulation,\nlimited access to target companies and cultural assimilation challenges. Our failure to address these risks\nsuccessfully may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such\nacquisition or investment may require a significant amount of capital investment, which would decrease the amount\nof cash available for working capital or capital expenditures. In addition, if we use our equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions, the value of our ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares may be diluted. If we borrow funds to\nfinance acquisitions, such debt instruments may contain restrictive covenants that can, among other things, restrict\nus from distributing dividends.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches or unexpected system outages or failures could impact our\nbusiness.\nOur computer systems and networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other malicious attempts. The reliability and\nsafety of our information technology infrastructure / software, and the ability to continually expand and update\ntechnologies / software in response to dynamic changing needs and cybersecurity threats, are critical to our business.\nIn recent years, there are increasing and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers,\nstate-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human / technological errors. All of the\nabove could result in the loss of our intellectual property, the leak of commercially sensitive information, and the\nmisappropriation of confidential information of our employees, customers and suppliers, and therefore could cause\nthe interruption of our business. Failures to protect the privacy of employees, customers or suppliers’ confidential\ndata against breaches of network security could result in the loss of existing or potential customers, other financial\nloss, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the operational cost and consequences against breaches and remedial\nmeasures could be significant. While we seek to annually review and assess our cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we still cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to\nnew and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As of March 31, 2024, we are\nnot aware of any material cyberattacks or incidents that had or would be expected to have a materially adverse effect\n18\non our business and operations, nor had we been involved in any legal proceedings or regulatory investigations\nrelated thereto.\nOur data centers are subject to the risk of break-ins and sabotage. Our disaster recovery plan cannot account for\nall eventualities. Consequently, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our data\ncenters could result in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Some of\nour system services are based on public cloud services, which are also subject to interruption due to cloud service\nproviders’ unexpected downtimes, cyberattacks or any type of failure, telecommunication failure and/or other\nunidentified problems while connecting to cloud. These cloud services interruptions could result in loss of\nproduction capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Cloud cybersecurity breaches could\nresult in adverse effects on our customers, employees, suppliers, reputation, and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our revenues\nand operating results.\nThe price of each semiconductor product typically declines over its product life cycle, reflecting product\nobsolescence, decreased demand as customers shift to more advanced products, decreased unit costs due to\nadvanced designs or improved manufacturing yields, excess inventory destocking amidst low market demand, and\nincreased competition as more semiconductor suppliers are able to offer similar products. We may experience\nsubstantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results if our average selling prices decline. We may\nreduce the average unit price of our products in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions\nby us or our competitors, and other factors. We expect that these factors will create downward pressure on our\naverage selling prices and operating results. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by\nincreasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost reductions, or if we fail to develop and introduce\nnew products and enhancements on a timely basis, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly competitive, and\nwe cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors.\nIncreased competition in the semiconductor industry may result in pricing pressure, reduced profitability and\nloss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations. We continually face\nintense competition from fabless display driver companies and integrated device manufacturers. Some of our\ncompetitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing\nand distribution of their products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer\ndemands or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products. Some of our\ncompetitors are affiliated with, or are subsidiaries of, our panel manufacturer customers. These relationships may\nalso give our competitors significant advantages such as early access to product roadmaps and design-in priorities,\nwhich would allow them to respond more quickly to changing customer demands and achieve more design-wins\nthan we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues and market share or\ncompete successfully against our competitors in the semiconductor industry.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to anticipate changes in evolving industry\nstandards, fail to achieve and maintain technological leadership in our industry or fail to develop and\nintroduce new and enhanced products.\nOur products are generally based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The emergence of new\nindustry standards could render our products or those of our customers unmarketable or obsolete and may require us\nto incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any such new standards. Our past sales and profitability have\nresulted, to a significant extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards, and to\ndevelop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely fashion. If we do not anticipate these changes in\ntechnologies and rapidly develop and introduce new and innovative technologies, we may not be able to provide\nadvanced display semiconductors on competitive terms, and some of our customers may buy products from our\ncompetitors instead of from us. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes and anticipate future standards will be\na significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our growth prospects. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to anticipate evolving industry standards, successfully complete the design of our\nnew products, have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields, or obtain significant purchase\norders for these products to meet new standards or technologies. If we fail to anticipate changes in technology and to\n19\nintroduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business and results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure\nOur ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by\ncommercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow,\nfund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist mainly of our 100% ownership interest in Himax Taiwan. We\nreceive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends\nin the past. Nonetheless, dividends and interest on shareholder loans that we receive from our subsidiaries in Taiwan,\nif any, will be subject to withholding tax under ROC law. The ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with loans,\npay dividends, repay any shareholder loans from us or make other distributions to us is restricted by, among other\nthings, the availability of funds, the terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as\nstatutory and other legal restrictions. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, pay dividends, and otherwise\nfund and conduct our business.\nPolitical, Geographical and Economic Risks\nClimate change and natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased\nconcentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has, and will continue to, cause\nsignificant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural\ndisasters. Changes in weather patterns and an increased frequency, intensity and duration of extreme weather\nconditions could, among other things, impair our production capabilities, disrupt the operation of our supply chain,\nand impact our customers and their demand for our services. There are inherent climate-related risks regardless of\nwhere we conduct our business. Climate-change-related weather events could negatively impact any of our locations\nor the locations of our customers, and may cause us to experience project delays, financial losses and/or additional\ncosts to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage, legal liability and reputational\nlosses.\nClimate change concerns have also led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting\ncarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of compliance, including costs\nassociated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing\nprocesses, increased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy\ncosts to reduce emissions, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both\nincurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us, which could harm our business and financial results\nby increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\nIn addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters to occur more frequently or with greater\nintensity. Most of our operations, and the operations of many of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers,\nsuppliers and customers are located in Taiwan, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, in particular, earthquakes\nand typhoons. Our principal foundries, tape and assembly and testing houses upon which we have relied to\nmanufacture substantially all of our display drivers are located in Taiwan. As a result of this geographic\nconcentration, disruption of operations at our facilities or the facilities of our semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders and suppliers for any reason, including work stoppages, power outages, water supply shortages, fire,\ntyphoons, earthquakes or other natural disasters, could cause delays in production and shipments of our products. In\naddition, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy\nof the government, such as to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country. Any delays or disruptions could result in our\ncustomers seeking to source products from our competitors. If such disruptions of operation occur at our customers’\nfacilities and our customers may be required to shut down temporarily or to substantially reduce the operations of\ntheir fabs, these events would seriously affect demand for our products.\n20\nDisruptions in Taiwan’s political environment could negatively affect our business and ADSs market price.\nOur principal executive offices and a substantial amount of our assets are located in Taiwan, and a substantial\nportion of revenues is derived from operations in Taiwan. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ADSs market price may be affected by changes in ROC policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, and by\nsocial instability and diplomatic issues that are outside of our control.\nTaiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and the PRC have been separately\ngoverned. The government of the PRC claims that it is the sole government in China and that Taiwan is part of\nChina. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between\nTaiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has refused to renounce the possibility that it may at some point use\nforce to gain control over Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC government adopted an anti-secession law relating to\nTaiwan. Relations between the ROC and the PRC governments have been strained in recent years for a variety of\nreasons, including the PRC government’s position on the “One China” policy and tensions concerning arms sales to\nTaiwan by the United States government. Any tension between the ROC and the PRC, or between the United States\nand the PRC, could materially and adversely affect our ADSs market prices.\nA substantial portion of our sales are made to customers in the PRC, which may expose us to additional\npolitical, regulatory, and economic risks.\nWe have been increasingly selling our products to customers in the PRC. In 2022 and 2023, approximately\n77.0% and 76.2% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in the PRC. We expect to\ncontinue to increase our sales to customers in the PRC in the future. With regional customer concentration, we are\nparticularly subject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in the PRC.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the\nstructure, level of government involvement, level of development, foreign exchange control and allocation of\nresources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy\nand is growing rapidly. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures\nemphasizing utilization of market forces in the development of the economy and also adjusted its macroeconomic\ncontrol policies from time to time. These policies have led and may continue to lead to changes in market conditions.\nFurther, if new, US sanctions are imposed on China and any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are\nimplemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory\ntrade actions due to recent U.S.-China trade tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our customers or\nsuppliers in China. We cannot predict whether changes in the PRC’s political, economic and social conditions, laws,\nregulations and policies will have any adverse effect on our customers in the PRC. In addition, the interpretation of\nPRC laws and regulations involves uncertainties. We cannot assure you that changes in such laws and regulations, or\nin their interpretation and enforcement, will not have a material adverse effect on the businesses and operations of\nour customers in the PRC and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses and affect our results of operations.\nOur functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. In 2023, more than 99% of our revenues and cost of\nrevenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency exposure and are primarily affected\nby fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar. This is because a majority portion of\nour employees and facilities are based in Taiwan and operating expenses are denominated in NT dollars and we\nmaintain a portion of our cash in NT dollars for Taiwan working capital purposes. For example, in December 2023,\napproximately 70% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage\ndenominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, and the majority of the remainder in U.S.\ndollars. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in exchange rate of U.S. dollars against such\ncurrencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our\noperating expenses as expressed in U.S. dollar and adversely affect our operating profit.\nChanges in ROC tax laws would likely increase our tax expenditures and decrease our net income.\nThe Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a tax-free country; accordingly, pretax income generated\nby the group parent company is not subject to local income tax. Substantially all of the Company’s taxable income is\nderived from the operations in the ROC and we are exposed primarily to taxes levied by the ROC government. Any\nunfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase our effective tax rate and have an\n21\nadverse effect on our operating results. See “Item 5.A. Operating and Financial Reviews and Prospects —Operating\nResults—Tax Credits” for further discussion of significant tax regulation changes.\nOn July 12, 2016, the ROC Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of anti-avoidance to establish Article 43-3\nControlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules and Article 43-4 Place of Effective Management (“PEM”) rules of the\nIncome Tax Act (“ITA”). Detailed introduction of the CFC and PEM rules are described as follows:\n(i) A profit-seeking enterprise (“PSE”) that directly or indirectly owns affiliated enterprises in low-tax\njurisdictions outside the territory of the ROC shall recognize and include its pro rata share of affiliated\nenterprises’ annual profits as investment income in its income tax return for the year. Subsequent\nactual dividends and distributions from such affiliated enterprises that were previously recognized as\ninvestment income will then not be subject to income taxation; any surplus to previously recognized\ninvestment income shall be included as taxable income in the allocated year. Low-tax jurisdictions are\ndefined as countries where the PSE income tax rate is lower than 70% of the income tax rate of the\nPSE in the ROC (the statutory income tax rate is 20% from January 1, 2018) (Article 43-3 CFC rules);\nand\n(ii) A PSE is incorporated based on foreign legislation but its place of effective management (PEM) is\nmaintained within the territory of the ROC, and the head office of such PSE will be determined to be\nwithin the territory of the ROC and profit-seeking enterprise income tax shall be levied in accordance\nwith the ITA and relevant tax regulations. The aforementioned PEM refers to a place where\nsubstantive key management and commercial decisions of an entity’s business and its operations are\nmade (Article 43-4 PEM rule).\nAccording to the legislative intent, the CFC and PEM rules, in principle, will not be put into force immediately,\nbut will wait until the China-Taiwan Cross-Strait Tax Agreement is effectuated, the OECD’s Common Reporting\nand Due Diligence Standard (“CRS”) for the automatic exchange of information of financial accounts is widely\nimplemented internationally, and the relevant bylaws of the CFC and PEM rules have been adequately enacted and\nproperly advocated. The date of implementation will be determined by the Executive Yuan. On January 14, 2022,\nExecutive Yuan had announced the relevant bylaws of the CFC would be implemented from January 1, 2023 and we\nexpect that CFC would have no material impact to affect our operating profit.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However,\nif the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be\ndetermined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income\nTax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax\nin the ROC.\nWe may be affected by the Cayman Economic Substance Law\nPursuant to the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision) (as amended) of the\nCayman Islands (the “ES Act”), a “relevant entity” is required to satisfy the economic substance test set out in the\nES Act. A “relevant entity” includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands as is our company.\nBased on the current interpretation of the ES Act, we believe that our company, Himax Technologies, Inc., is a pure\nequity holding company since it only holds equity participation in other entities and only earns dividends and capital\ngains.\nAccordingly, for so long as our company is a “pure equity holding company”, it is only subject to the minimum\nsubstance requirements, which require us to (i) comply with all applicable filing requirements under the Companies\nAct (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands; and (ii) have adequate human resources and adequate premises in the\nCayman Islands for holding and managing equity participations in other entities. However, there can be no\nassurance that we will not be subject to more requirements under the ES Act. Uncertainties over the interpretation\nand implementation of the ES Act may have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our ADSs and Our Trading Market\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile.\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile and has ranged from a low of $5.22 to a high of $8.7 on the\nNASDAQ Global Select Market in 2023.\n22\nThe market price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: (1)\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (2) changes in financial estimates by securities\nresearch analysts; (3) changes in the expectation of our product launch timing, forecast and estimates; (4) conditions\nin the TFT-LCD and OLED panel market; (5) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other\ndisplay semiconductor companies; (6) announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (7) the addition or departure of key personnel; (8)\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar; (9) litigation related to our intellectual\nproperty; and (10) the release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or sales of additional\nADSs.\nIn addition, the worldwide financial crisis, disruptions in business and manufacture due to sluggish demand, and\nglobal developments relating to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global stock markets have experienced extreme price\nand volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many\ncompanies for reasons which may not be directly related to their operating performance, including but not limited to\nevents such as tax-loss selling, mutual fund redemptions, hedge fund redemptions and margin calls. These market\nfluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs.\nFuture sales or perceived sales of securities by us, our executive officers, directors or major shareholders may\nhurt the price of our ADSs.\nThe market price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales of ADSs or shares or the perception that these\nsales could occur. As of March 31, 2024, we had 349,448,102 outstanding shares and a significant number of our\nshares were beneficially owned by certain major shareholders such as our directors and executive officers. See “Item\n7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” If we, our executive officers, or\ndirectors or our shareholders sell ADSs or shares, the market price for our shares or ADSs could decline.\nYou may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting\nmaterials sufficiently in advance to be able to exercise your right to vote.\nExcept as described in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights\nattaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the\ndepositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by\nthe ADSs. In certain circumstances, the depositary shall refrain from voting and any voting instructions received\nfrom ADS holders shall lapse. Furthermore, in certain other circumstances, the depositary will give us a\ndiscretionary proxy to vote shares evidenced by ADSs. You may not receive voting materials sufficiently in advance\nto instruct the depositary to vote or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties will\nnot have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under\nthe deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights\nand the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act, or\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to\nfile a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a\nregistration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions\nfrom registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our\nrights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.\nYou may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.\nYour ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary\nmay close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenever it deems expedient in connection with the\nperformance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs\ngenerally when books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it\nnecessary or advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, any government, governmental body,\ncommission, or any securities exchange on which our ADSs or ordinary shares are listed, or under any provision of\nthe deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the deposited securities or any meeting of our shareholders, or\nfor any other reason.\n23\nYour ability to protect your rights through the United States federal courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct a substantial portion of our operations in Taiwan, and all of\nour directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. However, a substantial portion of our operations is conducted in\nTaiwan through Himax Taiwan, our wholly owned subsidiary, and substantially all of our assets are located in\nTaiwan. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of\nthose persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an\naction against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have\nbeen infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind,\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to enforce a United States judgment against\nour assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of\njudgments obtained in the United States, although a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of\nthe United States under which a sum of money is payable, other than a sum payable in respect of multiple damages,\ntaxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, may be subject to enforcement\nproceedings as debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation, provided that\n(a) such federal or state courts of the United States had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment;\n(b) such federal or state courts of the United States did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman\nIslands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to\nthe public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to\nthe rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct\nprocedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\nTherefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against\nour management, directors or major shareholders than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in\nthe United States.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder because judicial precedents regarding\nshareholders’ rights are more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, and because Cayman\nIslands law generally provides less protection to shareholders than U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law, Cap. 22\n(Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman Islands Companies Law, and\nthe common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against directors, actions by\nminority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a\nlarge extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law is derived in part from\ncomparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has\npersuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes\nor judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less\ndeveloped body of securities law than the United States.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n4.A. History and Development of the Company\nHimax Taiwan, our predecessor, was incorporated on June 12, 2001 as a limited liability company under the\nlaws of the ROC. On April 26, 2005, we established Himax Technologies Limited, an exempted company with\nlimited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as a holding company to hold the shares of Himax\nTaiwan in connection with our reorganization and share exchange. On October 14, 2005, Himax Taiwan became our\nwholly owned subsidiary through a share exchange consummated pursuant to the ROC Business Mergers and\nAcquisitions Law through which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Himax Taiwan, and we\nissued ordinary shares to the shareholders of Himax Taiwan. Shareholders of Himax Taiwan received one of our\nordinary shares in exchange for one Himax Taiwan common share. The share exchange was unanimously approved\nby shareholders of Himax Taiwan on June 10, 2005 with no dissenting shareholders and by the ROC Investment\nCommission on August 30, 2005 for our inbound investment in Taiwan, and on September 7, 2005 for our outbound\ninvestment outside of Taiwan. We effected this reorganization and share exchange to comply with ROC laws, which\nprohibit a Taiwan incorporated company not otherwise publicly listed in Taiwan from listing its shares on an\n24\noverseas stock exchange. Our reorganization enables us to maintain our operations through our Taiwan subsidiary,\nHimax Taiwan, while allowing us to list our shares overseas through our holding company structure.\nOn September 26, 2005, we changed our name to “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” and on October 17, 2005, Himax\nTaiwan changed its name to “Himax Technologies Limited” upon the approval of shareholders of both companies\nand amendments to the respective constitutive documents. We effected the name exchange in order to maintain\ncontinuity of operations and marketing under the trade name “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” which had been\npreviously used by Himax Taiwan.\nOur ADSs have been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since March 31, 2006. Our ordinary shares\nare not listed or publicly traded on any trading markets.\nIn February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wisepal, currently known as Himax Semiconductor, Inc., a\nfabless semiconductor company focusing on the development of LTPS TFT-LCD drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications. This transaction strengthened our competitive position in the small and medium-sized\nproduct areas and further diversified our technology and product offerings. For management purpose, Himax\nSemiconductor Inc. was merged into Himax Taiwan on July 2, 2018.\nIn March 2007, we established Himax Imaging, Inc., which develops and markets CMOS image sensors with an\ninitial focus on camera applications used in cell phones and notebook computers.\nIn July 2012, our subsidiary, Himax Display, completed the acquisition of Spatial Photonics, currently known\nas Himax Display (USA) Inc., a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and production of\nMEMS products.\nIn June 2018, we completed the acquisition of Emza Visual Sense Ltd., or Emza, which is dedicated to the\ndevelopment of visual sensors that include proprietary machine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that\nenable always-on visual sensing capabilities, achieving improvement in power consumption, price and form factor.\nOn October 25, 2022, we disposed of 100% of our shareholdings in Emza to a third party.\nFrom time to time, we have also made minority investments in various companies for strategic purposes in the\nordinary course of business.\nOur principal executive offices are located at No. 26, Zilian Road, Xinshi District, Tainan City 744092, Taiwan,\nRepublic of China.

Business Overview\nWe are a leading global fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing\ntechnologies. Our display driver ICs and timing controllers have been adopted at scale across multiple industries\nworldwide including TVs, PC monitors, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, ePaper devices, industrial\ndisplays, among others. As the global market share leader in automotive display technology, we offer innovative and\ncomprehensive automotive IC solutions, including traditional driver ICs, advanced in-cell Touch and Display Driver\nIntegration (TDDI), Large Touch and Display Driver Integration (LTDI) and local dimming timing controllers\n(Local Dimming TCON), as well as and AMOLED solutions, including AMOLED drivers, TCONs and touch\ncontroller ICs. We are also a pioneer in tinyML visual-AI and optical technology related fields. Our industry-leading\nWiseEyeTM Smart Sensing technology which incorporates Himax proprietary ultralow power AI processor,\nalways-on CMOS image sensor, and CNN-based AI algorithm has been widely deployed in consumer electronics\nand AioT related applications. While Himax optics technologies, such as wafer level optics (WLO), LCoS\nmicrodisplays and 3D sensing solutions, are critical for facilitating emerging AR/VR/metaverse technologies.\n25\nBesides, Himax designs and provides touch controllers, AMOLED ICs, LED drivers, EPD drivers, power\nmanagement ICs, and CMOS image sensors for diverse display application coverage.\nIndustry Background\nWe mainly operate in the flat panel display semiconductor industry. As the majority of our revenues derive\nfrom products that are critical components of flat panel displays, such as display drivers, timing controllers, power\nICs and other semiconductor products, our industry is closely linked to the trends and developments of the flat panel\ndisplay industry.\nFlat Panel Display Semiconductors\nFlat panel displays require different semiconductors depending upon the display technologies and the\napplications. Some of the most important ones include the following:\nDisplay Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers precise\n⚫\nanalog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The major application of display driver IC is\nused on TFT-LCDs. Other than display drivers for TFT-LCDs, we also offer display drivers for OLED and\nElectronic Paper (e-paper) Displays. OLED display is getting more and more popular in recent years,\nstarting from high-end smartphone and TV applications towards tablet, notebook and automotive, while\ne-paper display mimics traditional paper sheet and holds static text and images indefinitely without\nelectricity. Detailed display driver IC specification for LCD, OLED and e-paper are different due to panel\ncharacteristics. The two main types of display drivers for a display panel are gate drivers and source drivers.\nGate drivers turn on the transistor within each pixel cell on the horizontal line on the panel for data input at\neach row. Source drivers receive image data from the timing controller and generate voltage that is applied\nto the liquid crystal within each pixel cell on the vertical line on the panel for data input at each column.\nThe combination determines the colors generated by each pixel. Typically, multiple gate drivers and source\ndrivers are installed separately on the panel. However, for certain small and medium-sized applications,\ngate drivers and source drivers are integrated into a single chip due to space and cost considerations.\nLarge-sized panels typically have higher resolution and require more display drivers than small and\nmedium-sized panels. In addition, TDDI IC integrates both display driver and in-cell touch functions and is\nusually adopted by small and medium sized display applications, whereas Timing Controller feature is also\nembedded in TDDI.\nTiming Controller. The timing controller receives image data and converts the format for the source\n⚫\ndrivers’ input. The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate and source drivers.\nTypically, the timing controller is a discrete semiconductor in TFT-LCD, OLED and e-paper panels. For\ncertain small and medium-sized applications, however, the timing controller may be integrated with display\ndrivers.\nOperational Amplifier. An operational amplifier supplies the reference voltage to source drivers in order to\n⚫\nmake their output voltage uniform.\nPower IC. Power ICs include certain drivers, amplifiers, DC to DC converters and other semiconductors\n⚫\ndesigned to enhance power management, such as voltage regulation, voltage boosting and battery\nmanagement.\nTouch Controller IC. For touch screen applications, touch controller ICs enable touch interfaces, such as\n⚫\ncapacitive touch panels, to identify, qualify and track user’s contacts with precision and sensibility. For\nTFT LCD panels, the touch controller may be integrated with display drivers as an in-cell TDDI solution,\ncommonly adopted in devices including smartphones, tablets, automotive displays, and notebooks. In\ncontrast, OLED panels typically adopt a discrete touch controller to realize touch functionality.\nOthers. Flat panel displays also require multiple general purposes semiconductors such as memory, power\n⚫\nconverters and inverters.\n26\nCharacteristics of the Display Driver Market\nAlthough we operate in several distinct segments of the flat panel display semiconductor industry, our principal\nproducts are display drivers. Display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays. The display driver market\nhas specific characteristics, including those discussed below.\nConcentration of Panel Manufacturers\nThe global TFT-LCD panel industry consists of a small number of manufacturers, substantially all of which are\nbased in Asia. In recent years, Korean TFT-LCD panel makers have gradually undergone restructurings to shift their\ntechnology and manufacture focus from TFT-LCD to OLED and TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, especially\nChina-based manufacturers which have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct and ramp up\nadditional fab capacity. The capital-intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel manufacturers\noperating at a high level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to create a temporary\noversupply of panels, which reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing pressure on component\ncompanies including display driver companies. Moreover, the concentration of panel manufacturers permits major\npanel manufacturers to exert pricing pressure on display driver companies such as us. The small number of panel\nmanufacturers exacerbates this situation as display driver companies, in addition to seeking to expand their customer\nbase, must also focus on winning a larger percentage of such customers’ display driver requirements.\nCustomization Requirements\nEach panel display has a unique pixel design to meet its particular requirements. To optimize the panel’s\nperformance, display drivers have to be customized for each panel design. The most common customization\nrequirement is for the display driver company to optimize the gamma curve of each display driver for each panel\ndesign. Display driver companies must work closely with their customers to develop semiconductors that meet their\ncustomers’ specific needs in order to optimize the performance of their products.\nMixed-Signal Design and High-Voltage CMOS Process Technology\nDisplay drivers have specific design and manufacturing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor\nindustry. Some display drivers require mixed-signal design since they combine both analog and digital devices on a\nsingle semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data. Manufacturing display drivers require\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5 to 24 volts for source drivers and 10 to 50 volts\nfor gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in the semiconductor industry. For display drivers, the\ndriving voltage must be maintained under a very high degree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve using\nstandard CMOS process technology. Moreover, manufacturing display drivers does not require very small-geometry\nsemiconductor processes. Typically, the manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require geometries\nbetween 0.11 micron and 1 micron because the physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not allow for the\neconomical reduction in geometries below this range. We believe that there are a limited number of fabs with\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing of display drivers.\nSpecial Assembly and Testing Requirements\nManufacturing display drivers requires certain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that are not\nstandard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited number of providers. The assembly of display drivers\ntypically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass, also known as COG,\ntechnologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold bumps are plated onto\neach wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and the glass, in the case of COG\npackages. TAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip on film, also known as COF. The type\nof assembly used depends on the panel manufacturer’s design, which is influenced by panel size and application and\nis typically determined by the panel manufacturers. Display drivers for large-sized applications typically require\nTAB package and, to a lesser extent, COG package types, whereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and\nconsumer electronics products typically require COG packages. The testing of display drivers also requires special\ntesters that can support high-channel and high-voltage output semiconductors. Such testers are not standard in the\nsemiconductor industry.\n27\nSupply Chain Management\nThe manufacturing of display drivers is complex and requires several manufacturing stages such as wafer\nfabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing, and the availability of materials such as the processed tape\nused in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and material requirements collectively as the\n“supply chain”. Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of capacity utilization and require a reliable\nsupply of display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this supply, may disrupt panel\nmanufacturers’ operations. As a result, a company’s ability to deliver its products on a timely basis at the quality and\nquantity required is critical to satisfying its existing customers and winning new ones. Such supply chain\nmanagement is particularly crucial to fabless display driver companies that do not have their own in-house\nmanufacturing capacity. In the case of display drivers, supply chain management is further complicated by the\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology and the special assembly and testing requirements that are not standard in\nthe semiconductor industry. Access to this capacity also depends in part on display driver companies having\nreceived assurances of demand for their products since semiconductor manufacturing service providers require\ncredible demand forecasts before allocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity to\nsupport growth.\nNeed for Higher Level of Integration\nThe small form factor of smartphone, tablet, automotive and certain consumer electronics products restricts the\nspace for components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically require one or more source drivers, one\nor more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors or as an integrated\nsingle-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order to manufacture more\ncompact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display driver companies must be able\nto offer highly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver and timing controller, as well as\nsemiconductors such as memory, power circuit and image processors, into a single chip. Due to the size restrictions\nand stringent power consumption constraints of such display drivers, single-chip drivers are complex to design. For\nlarge-sized panel applications, integration is both more difficult to achieve and less important since size and weight\nare less of a priority. Lastly, as some of our TFT-LCD panel customers had turned to pure in-cell TDDI panel\ndevelopment for thinner display designs, we have developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated\ncircuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.\nProducts and Solutions\nWe have several principal product lines:\n• Display drivers and timing controllers;\n• Touch controller ICs;\n• ASIC service;\n• LCoS and MEMS products;\n• Power ICs;\n• CMOS image sensor products;\n• Wafer level optics products;\n• 3D sensing business; and\n• Ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing.\nDisplay Drivers and Timing Controllers\nDisplay Driver Characteristics\nDisplay drivers deliver precise analog voltages and currents that activate the pixels on panels. The following is a\nsummary of certain display driver characteristics and their relationship to panel performance.\n28\nResolution and Number of Channels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied by the\n⚫\nnumber of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed on a panel. For\nexample, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red columns, 1,024 green columns and\n1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and 768 rows. The red, green and blue columns are\ncommonly referred to as “RGB.” Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072 column outputs and 768\nrow outputs. The number of display drivers required for each panel depends on the resolution of the panel\nand the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) panel requires\neight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three 256-channel gate drivers (768 = 256 x 3),\nwhile a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel requires eight 720-channel source drivers and four\n270-channel gate drivers. The number of display drivers required can be reduced by using drivers with a\nhigher number of channels. For example, a full HD panel can have six 960-channel source drivers instead\nof eight 720-channel source drivers. Thus, using display drivers with a higher number of channels can\nreduce the number of display drivers required for each panel, although display drivers with a higher number\nof channels typically have higher unit costs.\nColor Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a screen, which is determined by\n⚫\nthe number of shades of a color, also known as gray scale, that can be shown by the panel. For example, a\n6-bit source driver is capable of generating 26 x 26 x 26 = 218, or 262K colors, and similarly, an 8-bit source\ndriver is capable of generating 16 million colors. Typically, for TFT-LCD panels currently in commercial\nproduction, 262K, 16 million and 1 billion colors are supported by 6-bit, 8-bit and 10-bit source drivers,\nrespectively.\nOperational Voltage. A display driver operates with two voltages: the input voltage (which enables it to\n⚫\nreceive signals from the timing controller) and the output voltage (which, in the case of source drivers, is\napplied to liquid crystals and, in the case of gate drivers, is used to switch on the TFT device). Source\ndrivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from 4.5 to 24\nvolts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from\n10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers electromagnetic interference, or EMI. Output\nvoltage may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the liquid crystal (or diode), in the case\nof source drivers, or TFT device, in the case of gate drivers.\nGamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to it by\n⚫\nthe source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve” of the source driver. Different panel\ndesign and manufacturing processes require source drivers with different gamma curves. Display drivers\nneed to adjust the gamma curve to fit the pixel design. Due to the materials and processes used in\nmanufacturing, panels may contain certain imperfections which can be corrected by the gamma curve of\nthe source driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma correction.” For certain types of liquid\ncrystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly different and thus need to be independently\ncorrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three independent gamma curves for RGB cells.\nDriver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display drivers.\n⚫\nDisplay drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data\nvolume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data transmission applications, such as\ntelevisions, require more advanced interface technology. The principal types of interface technologies are\ntransistor-to-transistor logic, or TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS, mini-low voltage\ndifferential signaling, or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high-speed interface. Among these, RSDS,\nmini-LVDS and point-to-point interface were developed as low power, low noise and low amplitude\nmethods for high-speed data transmission using fewer copper wires and resulting in lower EMI. Moreover,\nthere are some panel manufacturers developing their proprietary point-to-point interfaces, such as\nembedded panel interface, or EPI, USI-T, iSP, CEDS, CHPI, CSPI and CMPI.\nPackage Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses TAB and COG package types. COF and TCP\n⚫\nare two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly used in recent years.\nCustomers typically determine the package type required according to their specific mechanical and\nelectrical considerations. In general, display drivers for small-sized panels mainly use COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for large-sized panels primarily use TAB package types and, to a lesser extent,\nCOG package types.\n29\nLarge-Sized Applications\nWe provide source drivers, gate drivers, PMIC, P-gamma OP level shifter and timing controllers (TCON) for\nlarge-sized panels principally used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and televisions. Display drivers used in\nlarge-sized applications feature different key characteristics, depending on the end-use application. For example, the\nindustry trend for large-sized applications is generally toward super high channel, low power consumption, low cost,\nthin and light form factor, touch function, higher data transmission rate and higher driving capabilities. Higher speed\ninterface technologies are also key for 4Kx2K and 8Kx4K high-resolution TVs. Greater color depth, thermal\nsolution, high data rate and high driving, are particularly important for advanced televisions and certain monitors.\nOur large display driver IC business achieved several milestones since 2019. For example, we successfully\nadded 12-inch fabs into the pool of our foundry capacity for our large display driver ICs to ease the capacity\nshortage of 8” foundry where the vast majority of large panel driver ICs are fabricated. On high-end TV, Himax\noutpaced peers to lead the mass production of customized high-speed point-to-point (P2P) transmission using\nembedded panel intra interface such as iSP, CHPI, USI-T, CMPI, CEDS and CSPI for 4K TVs and 8K TV. On\ngaming monitor, we have high frame rate and high driving driver to meet various resolutions needs and frame rates\nsuch as UHD 240Hz, QHD 360Hz, FHD 480Hz, etc. We also successfully developed low power consumption driver\napplied in low power monitor to satisfied Energy Star 8.0 and even Energy Star 9.0. Lastly, our P2P driver and\nTCON ICs with 13.3\" FHD can meet Intel 1W project requirements.\nWe also made tremendous progress in TCON product lines in 2022. The UHD TV penetration rate is larger than\n65% in 2022, and we developed competitive UHD TV TCON to seize this market. Himax UHD TV TCON has mass\nproduction at all major China LCD makers. We also provide gaming TCON for the new QHD 360Hz and UHD\n240Hz gaming monitor and notebook. For high-end gaming requirement, we have developed eDP 8.1G TCON to\nincrease bandwidth.\nThe table below sets forth the features of our products for large-sized applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers 384 to 1920 output channels\n⚫\n6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16 million colors) or 10-bit (1 billion\n⚫\ncolors)\none gamma-type driver\n⚫\ntwo gamma-type drivers to improve display quality\n⚫\nthree gamma-type drivers (RGB independent gamma curve to\n⚫\nenhance color image)\noutput driving voltage ranging from 7 up to 20V\n⚫\ninput logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n⚫\nand support half VDDA\nlow power consumption and low EMI\n⚫\nsupport COF and COG package types\n⚫\nsupport TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS (up to 460MHz), cascade\n⚫\nmodulated driver interface, or CMDI, point-to-point high speed\ninterface (up to 4Gbps for 8K 120Hz) and customized interface\ntechnologies\nsupport dual gate and triple gate panel designs\n⚫\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers 192 to 1600 output channels\n⚫\noutput driving voltage ranging from 10 up to 40v\n⚫\ninput logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n⚫\nlow power consumption\n⚫\nsupport COF and COG package types\n⚫\nsupport dual gate and triple gate panel designs\n⚫\nTiming Controllers product portfolio supports a wide range of resolutions, from VGA\n⚫\n(640 x 480 pixels) to full HD, UHD and 8K4K (1,920 x 1,080 pixels,\n1,920 x 1,200 pixels, 3840 x 2160 and 7680 x 4320)\nsupport mini-LVDS, point-to-point high speed interface and\n⚫\ncustomized output interface technologies\n30\nProduct Features\nembedded overdrive function to improve response time\n⚫\nsupport CABC and local dimming to save power and color engine to\n⚫\nenhance color and sharpness\nsupport LVDS, eDP, MIPI and V-by-one input interface technologies\n⚫\nsupport dual-gate, triple-gate, GOA (gate on array) and RGBW panel\n⚫\ndesigns\nsupport amorphous silicon, IGZO and LTPS panel\n⚫\nASIC AMOLED Timing Controller\n⚫\nASIC uLED Timing Controller\n⚫\nProgrammable Gamma OP 8 to 16 channel gamma buffer outputs\n⚫\nchannel VCOM buffer output\n⚫\nInternal non-volatile memory\n⚫\n2 gamma bank selection, setting time < 3uS\n⚫\nAnalog power supply voltage: 9.0V to 20.0V\n⚫\nDigital power supply voltage: 2.7V to 3.6V\n⚫\nPeak current on gamma channels: 200mA\n⚫\nPeak current on VCOM channel: 400mA\n⚫\nProgrammable VCOM limit\n⚫\n12C speed up to 1MHz\n⚫\nSmall and Medium-Sized Applications\nAutomotive Display Applications\nWe offer source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers and integrated drivers for the fast-ramping automotive\ndisplay applications, such as instrument cluster display (ICD), center stack display (CSD), head-up display (HUD),\nrear seat entertainment display (RSE), rearview mirror display and sideview mirror display.\nThe automotive display drivers can support various display resolutions to meet the customized needs of\nautomotive display, including GIP panel and non-GIP panel, a-Si TFT panel and LTPS panel. Meanwhile, the\nautomotive display drivers can support higher output driving voltage for higher contrast ratio and faster liquid\ncrystal response in automotive display applications. The automotive Timing Controller can support Local Dimming\nfunction for the goal of higher contrast ratio and thermal reduction in automotive display applications.

This has also contributed to increased demand for larger size and higher\nresolution smartphone displays. In 2016, Himax developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated\ncircuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel. Himax started the shipments of in-cell TDDI for some\nsmartphones in 2016 and extended TDDI solution to tablet application in 2017. In-cell TDDI, featuring thinner\ndisplay, slimmer border, and better visual quality, has been getting popular, so we re-invented a new generation of\nTDDIs supporting COG and COF for 18:9 or wider aspect ratio with interlaced output pins, which makes the bottom\nborder of the in-cell touch display even smaller to gain higher display to body ratio. Our FHD+ and HD+ TDDI\nsuccessfully gained design-wins with a few leading Korean and Chinese smartphone brands and panel makers. We\nstarted small volume shipments in the first half of 2018 with accelerating volume starting in the second half of 2018\ninto 2019 and beyond. Starting in 2020, Himax extended our product offerings with high frame rate TDDI solution\nand has started shipping to top-tier smartphone OEMs.\nA major development we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the OLED display for\nsmartphone, smart watch, automotive and tablet. We are collaborating closely with leading panel makers across\nChina and Korea for AMOLED product development in smartphone, tablet, automotive and other consumer\nelectronics. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company’s flexible AMOLED driver and TCON for automotive display\nsuccessfully ramped up for a customer’s flagship EV model, while in the second quarter of 2022, the Company\ncommenced production of AMOLED TCON and Driver IC chipsets for tablet applications for a leading OEM for\ntheir 11-inch and 12.6-inch flagship models. Concurrently, the number of awarded projects in AMOLED for\nautomotive and tables with worldwide named vendors is increasing. Himax continues its R&D efforts to upgrade\nnew TCON and OLED DDIC solutions for tablet PC applications. We believe AMOLED solutions, including driver\nICs and TCONs, will become one of the major growth engines for the Company moving forward.\nOn the other hand, the application of in-cell TDDI started to extend from mainstream smartphone to larger\ndisplays in 2018. Himax started to offer various new TDDI solutions for tablet, smart speakers, and even some\ninfotainment displays in automobiles. The first tablet TDDI with WXGA resolution went into mass production in\n2018 and also extended to leading smart speaker applications as well. In 2019, Himax announced a series of new\ndriver and TDDIs for tablet application. The COF packaged driver IC solution enabled one leading tablet OEM to\nsuccessfully launch a WQXGA resolution tablet with super slim bezel. We also added another new features to our\nTDDI that can support up to WUXGA and WQXGA resolution which has gained several design-wins from tablet\nOEMs across Korea and China in 2019. We also launched the first TDDI supporting active stylus function in tablets\nwhich commenced mass production and contributed to our tablet application business in early 2020. With the\ndemand increase for bigger size display, higher resolution, and precise touch accuracy and stylus performance,\nHimax kept developing new tablet TDDIs to broaden the company’s product lineup to maintain our leading market\nposition. We started mass production for the world’s first 12.4” WQXGA super high-resolution in-cell tablet PC\nwith a leading end customer in 2021 and expanded collaborations with more brands into more models moving\nforward.\n33\nTablet in-cell TDDI offers the benefits of lower cost and a simplified supply chain that represents an easier\nmanufacturing process for panel makers. For consumers, it offers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish design\nas well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus. Our active stylus in-cell technology is\nadopted in many launched tablet products. At present, we are the dominant supplier for literally all leading Android\nnames. In 2020, tablet demand picked up significantly, fueled mainly by remote work and online learning demand\ndue to the pandemic. TDDI for tablet application continues to broaden its market, representing a potential upside for\nHimax into 2023 and beyond.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our products for smartphone and tablet applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD TDDI for smartphone and In-cell TDDI (Touch and Display Driver Integration) as a highly\n⚫\ntablet integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, gate driver,\npower circuit, timing controller and memory, touch sensor ADCs and\nmicrocontroller\nMainstream smartphone single chip for HD+ (720RGB x Y pixels) or\n⚫\nFHD+ (1080RGB x Y pixels)\nMainstream tablet PC resolutions for WXGA (800RGB x Y) with\n⚫\nsingle chip or WUXGA (1200RGB x Y), WQXGA (1600RGB x Y)\nwith 2-chip cascaded\nConventional 60Hz and up to 144Hz new high frame rate solutions\n⚫\nSupport MIPI interface and VESA DSC\n⚫\nSupport up to 16 million colors\n⚫\nSupport active stylus for tablet PC\n⚫\nCOG and COF solutions for super slim bottom border\n⚫\nTFT-LCD Tablet Display Drivers highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, power\n⚫\ncircuit, and timing controller\nsuitable for a wide range of resolutions from WSVGA (600 x 1024),\n⚫\nWXGA (800 x 1280), WUXGA (1200x1920) to WQXGA (1600 x\n2560)\nsupport up to 16 million colors\n⚫\nsupport RGB separated gamma adjustment\n⚫\nsupport CABC\n⚫\nsupport color enhancement features\n⚫\nsupport MIPI interface\n⚫\ntouch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell\n⚫\ntouch display\nsupporting TDDI with active stylus\n⚫\nCOG and COF solutions for super slim bezel\n⚫\nAMOLED Solutions ⚫ Smartphone single chip with sub-pixel rendering, Demura-IPs for\nFHD+ resolution with up to 144Hz high frame rate\nSupport MIPI interface and VESA DSC with 1 billion colors (10bit\n⚫\ngrayscale)\nTCON and Source driver IC for tablet with high resolution of\n⚫\n3.2Kx2K 144Hz with VRR\ncustomized ASICs\n⚫\nElectronic Paper Display Applications\nWe offer display driver for the Electronic Paper Display (EPD) applications, Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) and\nSignage Display.

Subsequently, we expanded our customer base to include\nmore well-known smartphone and tablet brands. In 2015, we developed a series of TDDI products for Tier 1 and\npanel makers and commenced mass production for smartphone brands. Additionally, we began mass production of\nour TDDI for tablet and automotive displays in 2019. TDDI has gradually replaced on-cell touch controllers and\ndiscrete driver solutions, offering thinner displays, slimmer borders, and better visual quality, thus becoming the\nmainstream technology. We continue to expand our TDDI solutions to replace discrete DDICs and touch controller\nICs in the TFT-LCD display market.\nSince 2023, aligning with the market trend of OLED display proliferation, we embarked on developing\nAMOLED on-cell touch controllers tailored for tablets, notebooks, and automotive OLED displays. Our AMOLED\non-cell capacitive touch controller boasts several innovations and merits. It is meticulously engineered, featuring an\nindustry-leading touch signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 45 dB, making it the ideal solution to meet the demands of\nflexible OLED panels commonly required for automotive applications. It also offers improved sensitivity to\nchallenging user conditions such as glove-wearing and wet finger operations, ensuring exceptional performance with\ndisplay quality unaffected by touch-display interactions. Moreover, our touch controller not only supports\nmulti-finger capacitive touch and is compatible with various types of OLED panels, but it can also cascade multiple\nchips to support displays larger than 20 inches. For consumer and IT applications, it boasts a 240Hz high touch\nreport rate at 5-finger operating conditions, and its embedded micro-controller single-chip solution reduces costs for\nflexible products. To support the state-of-the-art active stylus feature of tablet and notebook touchscreens, our\nAMOLED touch controller integrates multiple active stylus protocols, such as USI, MPP, LPP, and HPP. Our\nAMOLED designs have garnered several design wins from leading customers and are set to commence production\nin 2024.\n35\nThe following table summarizes the features of our touch controller products:\nProduct Features\nAMOLED Capacitive Touch multi-finger (up to 10 fingers) capacitive touch for on-cell AMOLED\n⚫\nController high touch SNR > 45dB, effectively reducing display interference and\n⚫\noffering better display quality\nhigh touch report rate: 240Hz @5 fingers\n⚫\nsupport large size panel (>20 inches)\n⚫\nsupports multi-chip cascading without extra MCU\n⚫\nintegrate multiple active stylus protocols: USI, MPP, LPP and HPP\n⚫\nlow power consumption\n⚫\n(automotive) support glove-wearing (up to 4 mm) and wet finger\n⚫\noperations\n(automotive) CISPR25 Class-5 EMC qualified\n⚫\n(automotive) support temperature range from -40 °C to 105 °C\n⚫\nASIC service\nFrom 2012, we successfully completed several ASIC service projects for Japan top TV, Projector and HMD\nmakers with advanced and high-performance customized video processing chips. All of these chips are implemented\nwith our proprietary video process platform that includes our video process display IPs and high-speed transmission\nIPs. The process nodes adopted for these ASICs are usually 40nm, 55nm and even 28nm processes. From 2016, we\nalso developed the depth sensing technology that aims 3D sensing and AR/VR markets.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our ASIC service:\nProduct Features\nASIC Service Well-established ASIC development platform, based on our unique\n⚫\nvideo processor and image processing technologies.\noffer a wide variety of video interface IPs, like LVDS, HDMI, DVI,\n⚫\nV-by-one, Display port, MIPI, MHL, etc.\nbuilt-in 8/32- bit microprocessor built-in video processing algorithm\n⚫\nlike super-high resolution, sun-light readable, MEMC, FRC, etc.\nbuilt-in 3D feature technologies like 2D-to-3D, Glasses-free 3D, 3D\n⚫\nmulti-view, 3D visual protection, etc.\nsupport 4K x 2K/ 5K x 2K/ 8K x 4K display\n⚫\nDepth sensing algorithm and hardware accelerator for 3D sensing\n⚫\nand AR/VR applications\nLCoS and MEMS Products\nHimax Display, our subsidiary, has contributed to our microdisplay products lines: Color-filter LCoS,\nColor-sequential LCoS, Front-Lit LCoS, Phase modulation LCoS and MEMS.\nThe latest development of Front-Lit LCoS enables an ultra-compact and extremely power-efficient optical\nengine by consolidating and integrating LED illumination system and the polarization beam splitter (PBS) into the\nmicro display module itself. Front-Lit LCoS enables a much-simplified optical engine design and assembly process\nthat could successfully lowered customers’ manufacturing time and costs.\nHimax Display is one of the market leaders of the LCoS industry since 2012 with its whole product line\npatented. Himax Display has a mass production ready liquid crystal assembly line, which is unique in the industry\nwith mass production shipping volume.

In\naddition, phase modulation technology provides LiDAR for autonomous driving and Wavelength Selective Switch\n(“WSS”) for Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (“WDM”) optical communications networks. In May 2023, Himax\nDisplay unveiled the cutting-edge color sequential Front-lit LCoS for advanced AR glasses solutions at Display Week.\nIt’s a new technology that features a lightweight, compact form factor and high brightness. Several tech giants in the\nindustry have shifted their focus away from micro-LED to our Front-Lit LCoS for their AR goggles after seeing\nCompany’s live demo at the event. This shift is demonstrative of our exceptional achievements in both performance\nand functionality, marked by breakthroughs not only in the luminance performance in full RGB color, but also in\nterms of superior optical efficiency, tiny form factor and ultra-lightweight design. These factors are critical and\nrepresent technological advancements that may meet rigorous requirements to support next generation see-through\ngoggles.\nWe provide a rich products family for customers to choose for different applications, as each product has its\nown most important parameters to select and Himax Display provides choices to customers.

The main products\nare Power Managements ICs (PMIC), Programmable Gamma OP ICs (PGOP) and Level Shifter ICs (LS). In recent\n37\nyears, PMIC/PGOP 2-in-1 and PMIC/PGOP/LS 3-in-1 PMIC have gradually become the mainstream solutions.\nBesides, Himax also provides power management solutions for OLED notebooks.\nPower Management ICs\nA power management IC integrates several power components to fulfill system power requirements. It may\ninclude step-up or step-down pulse width modulation, or PWM, DC-to-DC converters, low-dropout regulators, or\nLDO regulators, voltage detectors, operational amplifiers, p-gamma OP, level shifters, and/or other components. For\npanel module applications, a power management IC provides a reliable and precise voltage for source drivers, gate\ndrivers, timing controllers, and panel cells. Moreover, its built-in over-temperature and over-current protections help\nprevent components from being damaged under certain abnormal conditions. As integrating an increasing number of\ncomponents into a power management IC is likely to be a continuing trend, we believe power management ICs will\ncontinue to be critical components of a TFT-LCD and OLED panel module. The following table summarizes certain\nfeatures of our power management IC products:\nProduct Features\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • PMIC, PGOP 2-in-1 and Level Shifter\nSolutions for TFT-LCD and OLED • 2ch programmable gamma voltage inside\nNotebooks • PAVDD Synchronous Boost Converter\n• NAVDD Synchronous Inverting Converter\n• VGH / VGL Synchronous SIBO Converter\n• 3ch Vint OP for OLED Panel\n• built-in power MOSFET\n• step-up PWM converter\n• charge pump regulator\n• LDO regulator\n• programmable voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n• Vcom operational amplifier\n• I2C programmable\n• low frame rate control for power saving solution\n• built in UVLO, UVP, OVP, SCP and OTP protection\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • PMIC, PGOP and Level Shifter 3-in-1\nSolutions for Monitors • built-in power MOSFET\n• step-up PWM converter\n• HV LDO regulator\n• programmable voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n• programmable Vcom voltage / Vcom operational amplifier\n• programmable gamma voltage with operational amplifier\n• built in UVLO, UVP, OVP, SCP and OTP protection\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • PMIC, PGOP 2-in-1 and Level Shifter\nSolutions for TVs • built-in power MOSFET\n• step-up PWM converter\n• step-down PWM converter\n• charge pump and buck-boost regulator\n• HV LDO regulator\n• programmable voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n• Vcom operational amplifier\n• I2C programmable\n• programmable gamma voltage with operational amplifier\n• built in UVLO, UVP, OVP, SCP and OTP protection\n38\nProgrammable Gamma OP ICs\nIt is a Programmable Gamma, DVR and VCOM IC.

The products were\ndesigned firstly for camera-equipped mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and notebook computers, with a\nfocus on low light image and video quality. Although it seems relatively challenging for us to gain significant\nmarket share in conventional RGB camera, we do think there are various interesting and different applications in\n39\nimaging. Based on the technologies and IP we developed, on top of legacy products for laptop and multimedia we\nhave been supplying, our product lines have been expanded to cover three domains: ultralow power computer\nvision- Always-On Sensor (“AoS”), Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, and big pixel BSI sensors in automotive and\nsurveillance. In 2019, we further prioritized our focus on ultralow power computer vision- Always-On Sensor\n(“AoS”) as the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. Together\nwith the technologies we already developed, such as Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, we can provide our customers\nthe best integrated solutions for several specific domains.\nIn specific video applications such as battery-powered surveillance cameras, doorbell cameras, and door-lock\ncameras, customers require not just an ultralow power sensor for sensing or pre-rolling functions but also\nhigh-resolution video for end-users after an event occurs. Himax Imaging addresses these needs by providing a 1/3”\n4MP sensor with a 1:1 aspect ratio. This sensor features a 2048x2048 resolution tailored for doorbell and door-lock\ncameras, delivering a broad Field of View (FOV) in both horizontal and vertical directions. This capability allows\nusers to observe a visitor's entire body, even when they stand very close to the camera. Himax Imaging can offer a\nvariety of these 2-in-1 sensors, combining high-resolution video capabilities with low-resolution ultralow power\nimaging for the surveillance market.\nWe're dedicated to becoming one of the key players in the CMOS image sensor industry. We achieve this\nthrough ongoing investment in skilled human resources, optimizing our supply chain, and forging strategic\ntechnology advancements and partnerships.\nThe following table sets forth

Optics Products\nWafer level optics are optical products manufactured using semiconductor process on wafers. This innovative\napproach enables wafer level optics to manufacture micro/nano optics structure and high temperature resistance,\nmaking the compatible Surface-Mount Technology or SMT reflow process possible. We offer entire optical\nsolutions for customers who need compact and easy-to-handle optical products on their electronic devices.\nCombining traditional optical lens design, precise mold control and semiconductor manufacturing expertise, our\nWLO lens with integrated waveguide, refractive optics and diffractive optical element (DOE) is one of the best\nsolutions for next generation computational imaging module for 2D/3D illumination and 3D dot projector, which\ncan be applied to 3D face recognition, 3D sensing, 3D reconstruction, and gesture control. Himax is a pioneer in\nhigh-precision diffraction optics technology with over 15 years of experience, having worked on very different\ndesigns over a variety of applications with some of the world’s most heavyweight tech names. With the innovative\nprocess and specific structure, our wafer level optics products provide small form factor and compact module size to\nbe easily integrated into consumer products. The diffraction optics technology is now well adopted in 3D sensing,\nAR/VR devices, holographic display, automotive, biomedical inspection, optical communication, etc. We are seeing\nthat DOE plays an even more decisive role for the next generation optical technology in light of its high-precision\nand lightweight characteristics.\nOur WLO technology is also adapted to form microstructures such as lens array, DOE and lenticular lenses for\nadvanced applications in digital and computational imaging fields. These technologies stand in a unique position to\nintegral optical design, semiconductor manufacturing process, and compact packaging service, which are rarely\ncovered by one single company. Deeply rooted in core wafer level optics technologies, we provide highly\ncustomized optical solutions and high-volume manufacturing to many Tier-1 customers such as structured lighted\nand ToF 3D sensing on mobile devices, AR/VR gadgets, automotive, biomedical devices and many other AIoT\napplications.\nOur WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer.\nThe overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in\nmore models. In 2019, we continued the strong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill an anchor customer’s\nhigher demand with a significant year-over-year increase. We continued our shipment to an anchor customer for\ntheir legacy product and continue making progress on R&D projects with world-leading high-tech giants for ToF 3D\nsensing, AR/VR gadgets, automotive, biomedical devices and others, targeting their future generation products\ncentered around our exceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology. One\nillustration is our WLO technology being deployed by one VR player to empower 3D perception sensing for precise\ncontroller-free gesture recognition. We initialed volume production starting in second quarter of 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our wafer level optics products:\nProduct Features\nRefractive Optical Lens for Micro Lens Array (MLA) illumination diffuser, lighting control,\n⚫\nflux illumination lens, collimation lens, and compact size camera\nlens\nprovide multi-layer solution including optical AR coating,\n⚫\nIR-cutting filter coating, aspheric surface\ndouble-side manufacture process\n⚫\nalready in mass production\n⚫\nDiffractive Optical Element (DOE) computational imaging, flux illumination, dot projector for 3D\n⚫\nsensing, 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\nusing WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE and refractive lens\n⚫\nprovide customized solution for specific application\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable component\n⚫\neye safety detect circuit embedded\n⚫\n42\nDiffuser element for flood using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE technology\n⚫\nillumination and TOF the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n⚫\neye safety detect circuit embedded\n⚫\nNear Infrared (NIR) Projector dot projector module solution for computer vision, 3D sensing, 3D\n⚫\nModule reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\nintegral NIR Laser (830/850/940nm), optical system (refractive+\n⚫\ndiffractive lens) and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution to provide the smallest form factor\nmodule design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n⚫\nprovide customized module solution for different application\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable device\n⚫\nincluding active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n⚫\nFlood illumination Module provide customized solution for specific application integral NIR\n⚫\nLaser (830/850/940nm), and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution\nmodule design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable device\n⚫\nincluding active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n⚫\n3D Sensing Business\nWe continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing projects.\nIn 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing total solution targeting Android smartphone’s front-facing\napplication was unsuccessful due to the high hardware cost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time required\nto integrate it into the smartphone and the lack of killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and online\npayment. Instead of 3D sensing, most of the Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost fingerprint\ntechnology which can achieve similar phone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised\nuser experience.\nAs a leading provider of 3D sensing technology, Himax is also an active participant in smartphone OEMs’\ndesign projects for new devices involving ToF technology. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone\nmakers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D depth\ninformation generation for AR. Unlike structured light 3D sensing where we provide total solution or just projector\nmodule or optics depending on customers’ needs, with ToF, we will only focus on transmitter module or optics\ncomponent by leveraging our WLO related expertise. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we have provided our\npartners with spot projectors or optics components for their reference design.\n3D sensing can have a wide range of applications beyond smartphone. We have started to explore business\nopportunities in various industries by leveraging our structured light 3D sensing total solution. Starting in 2021, we\nshipped small volume of business access control and biomedical inspection devices. To strengthen our offers in 3D\nsensing total solution, we have been collaborating closely mainly with two types of partners: those with\nindustry-leading expertise in facial recognition algorithm and those offering application processors with strong AI\ncapability.\nOther than 3D sensing total solution, we also provide key component, including 3D decoder IC and 3D vision\nprocessors. Our proprietary 3D decoder IC can accelerate local image processing for face recognition and offer\nbest-in-class security authentication, therefore itis particularly suitable for customers who wish to design their own\nstructured light-based 3D sensing solution. It was already certified by the leading Chinese electronic payment\nstandard with requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation and strict privacy and now it’s well-adopted\nby many China e-payment solution providers. Our proprietary 3D decoder IC entered into volume production\nstarting in 2020, followed by meaningful volume shipments into 2021 and 2022. In the light of increasing adoption\nof 3D sensing technologies in various aspect of our daily life, a series of next generation 3D vision processors is also\nunder development to support a variety of state-of-the-art 3D sensing technologies in Time of Flight (”ToF”) and\nstructured light, aiming to improve user experience when people interact with AR and VR applications.\nOur critical 3D sensing Technologies includes the following:\n43\nWafer Level Optics Products\nWLO is one of the key technologies enabling 3D sensing, AR goggle devices, and many other applications.\nLevering on our exceptional design know-how and mass production experience in WLO technology, we are able to\nproduce the world’s most compact optics required for 3D sensing, while also achieving superior performance and\nlower costs.\nASIC\nOne of the critical elements of our 3D sensing total solution is an ASIC for 3D depth map generation. We are\nable to develop the ASIC thanks to our unique in-house capability in developing video ASICs for customers.\nEquipped with the ASIC, our 3D sensing total solution can substantially reduce the power consumed while\nprocessing 3D sensing, enhance personal data security, accelerate the 3D depth map generation, and provide\nsuperior depth data output that matches with our optical component. We consider this unique capability as our\ncompetitive advantage. It has been and will continue to be one of our key drivers in the success of our 3D sensing\ntotal solution.\nActive Alignment\nWith much experience in optical assembly for AR and VR devices, our factory has developed a system to do\nactive alignment for tiny components. From the incoming quality check, assembly process, and testing, all steps are\nmonitored and checked.

Through our collaboration with Panel Manufacturers, we have developed\nextensive knowledge of circuit design, TFT-LCD/OLED driving systems, high-voltage CMOS processes and\ndisplay systems, all of which are important to the design of high-performance TFT-LCD/OLED display drivers. Our\nengineers have in-depth knowledge of the driving system technology, which is the architecture for the interaction\nbetween the source driver, gate driver, timing controller and power systems as well as other passive components.\nWe believe that our understanding of the entire driving system has strengthened our design capabilities. Our\nengineers are highly skilled in designing power efficient and compact display drivers that enhance the performance\nof TFT-LCD/ OLED. We are leveraging our know-how of display drivers and driving system technology to develop\ndisplay drivers for panels utilizing other technologies such as next generation OLED and electronic paper displays.\nHigh-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design. Unlike most other semiconductors, TFT-LCD display drivers require a\nhigh output voltage of 3.3 to 50 volts. We have developed circuit design technologies using a high-voltage CMOS\nprocess that enables us to produce high-yield, reliable and compact drivers for high-volume applications. Moreover,\nour technologies enable us to keep the driving voltage at very high uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve\nwhen using standard CMOS process technology.\nHigh-Bandwidth Interfaces. In addition to high-voltage circuit design, TFT-LCD display drivers require high\nbandwidth transmission for video signals. We have applied several high-speed interfaces, including\ntransistor-transistor logic (“TTL”), Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), mini low-voltage differential\nsignaling (“LVDS”), dual-edge TTL (“DETTL”), turbo Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), Mobile\nIndustry Processor Interface (“MIPI”) and other customized interfaces in our display drivers. Moreover, we are\ndeveloping additional driver interfaces for special applications with optimized speed, lower EMI and higher system\nstability.\nDie Shrink and Low Power Technologies. Our engineers are highly skilled in employing their knowledge of\ndriving technology and high-voltage CMOS circuit design to shrink the die size of our display drivers while\nleveraging their understanding of driving technology and panel characteristics to design display drivers with low\npower consumption. Die size is an important consideration for applications with size constraints. Smaller die size\nalso reduces the cost of the chip. Lower power consumption is important for many portable devices such as\nnotebook computers, smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products.\n47\nWiseEye Smart Image Sensing Technologies. These technologies are composed by an AoS sensor, an edge AI\nASIC processor and computer-vision AI algorithm, all operated in ultralow power mode. Our industrial first AoS\nCMOS image sensor features ultralow power and low latency back-illuminated solution for always on, intelligent\nvisual sensing applications. With Himax’s exceptional low power know-how and ASIC implementation\ntechnologies, our WiseEye AI image processor featured different power domain and mode management schemes,\ntogether with advanced image processing hardwired accelerators to construct different operating modes in balancing\nprocessor performance and power consumptions. The seamless and proprietary interface between our AoS sensor\nand AI processor ensure the efficient and fast-response sensor data transmission and wake-up mechanism operating\nin ultralow power mode. The computer-vision AI algorithm, which benefits from high performance and low power\nAI processor and image data from sensor, can therefore enable AI features such as powerful human detection,\noccupancy detection and motion classification for various application needs.\nLCoS Microdisplay Technologies. Compared to other microdisplay technologies, LCoS microdisplay offers\nsmaller form factor, higher brightness, and less power consumption. Himax Display has own proficient engineering\nteam to develop patented industry-only non-captive LCoS, front-lit waveguide, and module design, along with an\nin-house ISO certified manufacture line, all of which positions us at the forefronts of leading AR glasses and\nAR-HUD markets.

Our end\nmarket is concentrated among a limited number of major Panel Manufacturers. We also market our products directly\nto TV, monitor, notebook and mobile, tablet and automotive device manufacturers so that our products can be\nqualified for their specifications and designed into their products. Furthermore, we extend our business development\nwith system and ODM companies by using strategic ASIC business model to not only develop ASIC product based\non customer specification but also jointly research and develop new technologies to meet customers' future product\ndemand. Additionally, we form strategic partnership with Tier 1 customers for our LCoS microdisplays, 3D sensing\nand WiseEye smart image sensing to penetrate into the emerging market. We believe we need close alliance with\nour customers to build up ecosystem for new applications.\n48\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales teams located in Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.\nWe also have dedicated sales teams for certain of our most important current or prospective customers.

This includes a highly trained team of product managers and field\napplications engineers. Our team is equipped with extensive strategic marketing experience and a strong capability\nto identify market trends. We also provide technical support and assistance to potential and existing customers in\nsystem/SoC architecture, designing, testing and qualifying display modules, camera modules and end application\nsystems that incorporate our products and ASICs. We believe that the depth and quality of this design support are\nkey to improving customers’ time-to-market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.\nManufacturing\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely on semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication, gold bumping,\nassembly and testing. We also rely largely on third-party suppliers of processed tape used in TAB packaging. We\nengage foundries with high-voltage CMOS process technology for our display drivers and engage assembly and\ntesting houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages, thereby taking advantage of the economies of scale and\nthe specialization of such semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to\ncapture certain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures,\nfixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the\nmost suitable for any given product. Despite our reliance on outsourcing for CP testing, we have made investments\nin internal capabilities for test program development, engineering testing, debugging capability and manufacturing\nsupport since 2022.\nWe operate a fab under Himax Display primarily for performing manufacturing processes for our LCoS\nmicrodisplays. Moreover, for better integration, we also established an in-house color filter facility under Himax\nTaiwan, which commenced shipments from 2010. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our\nproprietary single-panel color LCoS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness of\nour LCoS products and creates value for our customers. In addition, we have established an in-house WLO facility\nunder Himax Taiwan for the key process of our wafer level optics products, which started small-scale shipments\nfrom December 2009 and commenced mass shipment to anchor customer from 2017 onwards. We began\nconstruction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the current headquarters to house additional\nWLO capacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our 3D sensing business and to provide extra office\nspace. The construction of Fab 2 was completed in the first half of 2018.\nManufacturing Stages\nThe diagram below sets forth the various stages in manufacturing display drivers according to the two different\ntypes of assembly utilized: TAB or COG. The assembly type depends primarily on the application and design of the\n49\npanel and is determined by our customers.\nWafer Fabrication: Based on our design, the foundry provides us with fabricated wafers. Each fabricated wafer\ncontains many chips, each known as a die.\nGold Bumping: After the wafers are fabricated, they are delivered to gold bumping houses where gold bumps\nare plated on each wafer. The gold bumping process uses thin film metal deposition, photolithography and electrical\nplating technologies. The gold bumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die to the processed tape, in the case\nof TAB package, or the glass, in the case of COG package.\nChip Probe Testing: Each die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded.\nAssembly and Testing: Our display drivers use two types of assembly technology: TAB or COG. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and to a lesser extent COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products typically require COG package\ntypes.\nTAB Assembly\nWe use two types of TAB technologies: TCP and COF. TCP and COF packages are both made of processed\ntape that is typically 35mm or 48mm wide, plated with copper foil and has a circuit formed within it. TCP and COF\npackages differ, however, in terms of their chip connections. With TCP packages, a hole is punched through the\nprocessed tape in the area of the chip, which is connected to a flying lead made of copper. By contrast, with COF\npackages, the lead is mounted directly on the processed tape and there is no flying lead. In recent years, COF\npackages have become predominantly used in TAB technology.\n50\nInner-Lead Bonding: The TCP and COF assembly process involves grinding the bumped wafers into their\n⚫\nrequired thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies, or chips. An inner lead bonder machine\nconnects the chip to the printed circuit processed tape and the package is sealed with resin at high\ntemperatures.\nFinal Testing: The assembled display drivers are tested to ensure that they meet performance specifications.\n⚫\nTesting takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each product.\nCOG Assembly\nCOG assembly connects display drivers directly to LCD panels without the need for processed tape. COG\nassembly involves grinding the tested wafers into their required thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies,\nor chips. Each individual die is picked and placed into a chip tray and is then visually or auto-inspected for defects.\nThe dies are packed within a tray in an aluminum bag after completion of the inspection process.\nQuality Assurance\nWe maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system. Using a variety of methods, from conducting rigorous\nsimulations during the circuit design process to evaluating supplier performance at various stages of our products’\nmanufacturing process, we seek to bring about improvements and achieve customer satisfaction. In addition to\nmonitoring customer satisfaction through regular reviews, we implement extensive supplier quality controls so that\nthe products we outsource achieve our high standards. Prior to engaging a third party as our supplier, we perform a\nseries of audits on their operations, and upon engagement, we hold frequent quality assurance meetings with our\nsuppliers to evaluate such factors as product quality, production costs, technological sophistication and timely\ndelivery.\nIn November 2002, we received ISO 9001 certification, which was renewed in March 2024 and will expire in\nMarch 2027. In February 2006, we received ISO 14001 certification, which was renewed in December 2023 and\nwill expire in December 2026. In addition, in March 2007, we received IECQ QC 080000 certification, which was\nrenewed in February 2022 and will expire in March 2025.\nEnvironmental Management System and Safety and Health Management System\nHimax follows closely the global environmental trends, including energy saving and waste reduction, in its\ndaily operations. The Company is certified in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14064.\nHimax is a leader in its sector when it comes to the environment and safety, operating under measures much\nmore stringent than domestic regulations. The Company aims to grow sustainably, delivering economic, social and\nenvironmental benefits with its healthy employees.\nHimax has also been tirelessly reducing impacts to the environment and improving safety in its operations,\nspecifically targeting product design and waste handling.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Service Providers and Suppliers\nThrough our relationships with leading foundries, assembly, gold bumping and testing houses and processed\ntape suppliers, we believe we have established a supply chain that enables us to deliver high-quality products to our\ncustomers in a timely manner.\nAccess to semiconductor manufacturing service providers is critical as display drivers require high-voltage\nCMOS process technology and specialized assembly and testing services, all of which are different from industry\nstandards. We have obtained our foundry services from TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, Macronix, Globalfoundries\nSingapore, PSMC, Nexchip and SKHYSI in the past few years. These are among a select number of semiconductor\nmanufacturers that provide high-voltage CMOS process technology required for manufacturing display drivers. We\nengage assembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages such as Chipbond, Chipmore\nInternational trading company Ltd., ChipMOS Technologies Inc., Nepes Corporation and King Yuan Electronics\nCo., Ltd, etc.\nWe plan to strengthen our relationships with our existing semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\ndiversify our network of such service providers in order to ensure access to sufficient cost-competitive and\n51\nhigh-quality manufacturing capacity. We are selective in our choice of semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. It takes a substantial amount of time to qualify alternative foundries, gold bumping, assembly and testing\nhouses for production. As a result, we expect that we will continue to rely on a limited number of semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers for a substantial portion of our manufacturing requirements in the near future.\nThe table below sets forth (in alphabetical order) our principal semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nand suppliers:\nWafer Fabrication Gold Bumping\nGlobalfoundries Singapore Pte., Ltd.

LTD.\nFor wafer level optics products, we face competition primarily from Heptagon that was acquired by ams AG\nand certain new optical design houses from China, such as Angstrong Tech, Yuguang Science and Technology\nDevelopment Co.\nFor 3D sensing, Himax is one of the few companies that can provide the one-stop solution though there are\nmore companies attempting to jump into the game. ams AG and Orbbec will be the main competitors we face in the\nworldwide.\n53\nFor ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing, the main competition is Qualcomm with its “Glance” device.\nFew additional small size companies develop AI base edge devises, such as Lattice, Eta Computing, Nuvoton, Altek,\netc. However, Himax is the only vendor who can offer a truly in-house vertically integrated solution comprise with\nall three building blocks required by customers: CMOS sensor, purposely designed MCU and the AI algorithm.\nInsurance\nWe maintain insurance policies on our buildings, equipment and inventories covering property damage and\ndamage due to, among other events, fires, typhoons, earthquakes and floods. We maintain these insurance policies\non our facilities and on transit of inventories. Additionally, we maintain director and officer liability insurance. We\ndo not have insurance for business interruptions, nor do we have key person insurance.\nEnvironmental Matters\nHimax is required to ensure its products are obligated to comply with valid regulations and governmental\nauthorities’ regulatory directives in applicable jurisdictions relating to environmental protection regulations and\nsubject to the topic of Environmental Protection. Additionally, Himax Taiwan maintains a CP tester facility, a color\nfilter facility and a wafer level optics facility and Himax Display maintains a facility for our LCoS products. Himax\nIGI operates under the designated facility related for 3D mask production, where we have taken the necessary steps\nto obtain the appropriate permits and, to extents of Himax knowledge, believe that we are in compliance with the\nexisting environmental laws and regulations in the Taiwan ROC and US jurisdiction applicable. In addition, we have\nentered into various agreements with certain customers whereby we have agreed to indemnify them, and in certain\ncases, their customers, for any claims made against them for hazardous material violations that are found in our\nproducts.\n4.C.

Property, Plants and Equipment\nOur corporate headquarters are located at a 22,172 square meter facility within the Tree Valley Industrial Park\nin Tainan, Taiwan. We began construction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the current\nheadquarters. The newly completed building, located at a 42,619 square meter facility, houses additional WLO\ncapacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our 3D sensing business and provides extra office space.\nThe facilities house our research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, operations and general\nadministrative staff.\nWe also lease office space in Taipei and Hsinchu, Taiwan; Suzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Beijing, Shanghai,\nNingbo, Wuhan, Hefei, Xiamen, Chongqing, Fuqing, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South Korea;\nand Irvine and San Jose, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The lease contracts may be renewed upon\nexpiration.\nWe have established an in-house WLO facility under Himax Taiwan for the key process of our products. The\nfacility occupies 1,171 square meters of floor space in a building leased from Innolux, which was already produced\nand shipped over 50 million optics to Tier-1 customer since 2010. However, the building lease was terminated early\nat the end of January 2024, and we relocated the WLO facility to our Fab 2. We have also expanded certain facilities\nfor LCoS and WLO products to accommodate new customers and new applications located at our headquarters in\nTainan, Taiwan. In addition, Himax Taiwan owns and operates a fab with 1,431 square meters of floor space in a\nbuilding leased from Innolux in Tainan, where it established an in-house color filter facility that commenced\nshipments from 2010. The building lease was terminated early at the end of January 2024, and we relocated the\ncolor filter facility to our Fab 2. This in-house facility provides color filter for CMOS image sensor and LCoS\nproducts. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our proprietary single-panel color LCoS\nmicrodisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness of our color-filter LCoS microdisplays\nproducts and creates value for our customers. To build up test program development, engineering testing, debugging\ncapability and manufacturing support, we have established under Himax Taiwan an in-house CP test facility from\n2022.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and\ntheir accompanying notes included elsewhere herein which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n5.A. Operating Results\nFor discussion related to our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and the results of operations for\n2022 compared to 2021, refer to “Part I, Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,” in our Annual\nReport on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which was filed with the United States Securities\nand Exchange Commission on April 6, 2023.\nOverview\nWe commenced operations through our predecessor, Himax Taiwan, in June 2001. We must, among other\nthings, continue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product portfolio, maintain our leading\ntechnology position, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate declining average\nselling prices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover, we must continue to\naddress the challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and retaining managerial,\nengineering, operational and financial personnel and implementing and improving our existing administrative,\nfinancial and operations systems.\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication,\ngold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCoS microdisplay, wafer level optics\n56\nproducts and active alignment for 3D sensing, which we manufacture through our own factories. We are able to take\nadvantage of the economies of scale and the specialization of our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture certain financial and operational benefits, including\nreduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to\nuse the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given product. For LCoS microdisplay\nand wafer level optics products, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies and\nmanufacturing expertise in the effort to further expand these businesses.\nAs our semiconductors are critical components of flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the trends\nand developments of the flat panel display industry. The majority of our revenues in 2023 were derived from sales\nof display drivers that were eventually incorporated into TFT-LCD and OLED panels. We expect display drivers for\nTFT-LCD and OLED panels to continue to be our primary products. The TFT-LCD and OLED panel industry is\nintensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD and\nOLED panels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in downward pricing pressure on our\nproducts. See “Item 3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Condition and\nBusiness—We derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD and OLED panel industry, which\nis highly cyclical and subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact\nour business or results of operations.” The revenue expansion of our non-driver products as well as TFT-LCD and\nAMOLED products trending toward high resolution and any other new product introduction help to mitigate these\nrisks.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur business, financial position and results of operations, as well as the period-to-period comparability of our\nfinancial results, are significantly affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\naverage selling prices;\n⚫\nunit shipments;\n⚫\nproduct mix;\n⚫\ndesign wins;\n⚫\ncost of revenues and cost reductions;\n⚫\nsupply chain management;\n⚫\nshare-based compensation expenses and cash awards; and\n⚫\ntax credits.\n⚫\nAverage Selling Prices\nOur performance is affected by the selling prices of each of our products. We price our products based on\nseveral factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage of the product, competition, technical complexity of\nthe product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer. We typically are able to charge the\nhighest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are able to raise our selling\nprices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline over a product’s life cycle,\nwhich may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such as constraints in foundry capacity.\nFor example, from 2020, the industry-wide tightening of foundry capacity has extended to backend facilities that\ninclude assembly and testing and appears to be a long-term phenomenon. Robust demand pushed foundry capacity\nconstraints to a more severe level and rose higher material cost which in turn enabled higher average selling prices.\nHowever, decades-high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates in addition to the ongoing war and unexpected\nlockdowns from Covid-19 in China starting from the end of first quarter of 2022, brought widespread demand halt,\nresulting in sluggish demand across every aspect of our business, followed by sales declined and average selling\nprice erosion. The general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling prices of semiconductors to\ndecline over a product’s life cycle due to competition, production efficiencies, emergence of substitutes and\ntechnological obsolescence. Our cost reduction efforts also contribute to this decline in average selling prices. See\n“—Cost of Revenues and Cost Reductions.”\n57\nOur average selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. As new China panel\nmakers emerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their capacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will\nincrease accordingly, negatively impacting our average selling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by\nthe packaging type our customers choose as well as the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below.\nLastly, competition level affects our average selling prices as well. However, the impact of declining average selling\nprices on our profitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent by increased volume as lower prices may\nstimulate demand and thereby drive sales and TFT-LCD and OLED panel products trending toward higher\nresolution.\nUnit Shipments\nOur performance is also affected by the number of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As our display\ndrivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our unit shipments depend primarily on our customers’ panel\nshipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since our inception primarily as a result of our\nincreased market share with certain major customers and their increased shipments of panels. Our growth in unit\nshipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels which typically require more display drivers.\nHowever, the development of higher channel display drivers or new technologies, if successful, could potentially\nreduce the number of display drivers required for each panel while achieving the same resolution. If such\ntechnologies become commercially available, the market for our display drivers will be reduced and we could\nexperience a decline in revenue and profit. Our unit shipments also depend on the capacity we can get from our\nfoundry, assembly and testing house.\nProduct Mix\nThe proportion of our revenues that is generated from the sale of different product types, also referred to as\nproduct mix, also affects our average selling prices, revenues and profitability. Our display driver products vary\ndepending on, among other things, the number of output channels, the level of integration and the package type.\nVariations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices of such products. For example, the\ntrend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products with a higher number of channels, which\ntypically command higher average selling prices than traditional products with a lower number of channels.\nHowever, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically require fewer display drivers per panel. As a result,\nour profitability will be adversely affected to the extent that the decrease in the number of display drivers required\nfor each panel is not offset by increased total unit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers\nwith a higher number of channels. The level of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices,\nas more highly integrated chips typically have higher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected\nby changes in the package types used by our customers. For example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has\nlower material costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover, our different non-driver products vary in\naverage selling prices and costs.\nThe proportion of non-driver business would also affect our financial position and results of operations. For the\npast few years, we have experienced operating losses from our non-driver business. This was partly due to low sales\nvolume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to fully cover expenses such as research and\ndevelopment and operating expenses. We expect, however, to ramp up the volume production and sales of our\nnon-driver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-driver products. Typically,\nour non-driver products have higher gross margins as well as higher growth potential than our driver products, we\nexpect the overall profit margin across our product platform to improve.\nDesign Wins\nAchieving design wins is important to our business, and it affects our unit shipments. Design wins occur when a\ncustomer incorporates our products into their product designs. There are numerous opportunities for design wins,\nincluding, but not limited to, when panel manufacturers:\nintroduce new models to improve the cost and/or performance of their existing products or to expand their\n⚫\nproduct portfolio;\nestablish new fabs and seek to qualify existing or new component suppliers; and\n⚫\nreplace existing display driver companies due to cost or performance reasons.\n⚫\n58\nDesign wins are not binding commitments by customers to purchase our products. However, we believe that\nachieving design wins is an important performance indicator. Our customers typically devote substantial time and\nresources to designing their products as well as qualifying their component suppliers and their products. Once our\nproducts have been designed into a system, the customer may be reluctant to change its component suppliers due to\nthe significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier or a replacement component. Therefore, we\nstrive to work closely with current and prospective customers in order to anticipate their requirements and product\nroadmaps and achieve additional design wins.\nCost of Revenues and Cost Reductions\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2021, 2022\nand 2023 was 51.6%, 59.5% and 72.1%, respectively. In 2023, as a percentage of Himax Taiwan’s total\nmanufacturing costs, the cost of wafer fabrication was 50.5%, the cost of processed tape was 4.5%, the cost of\nassembly and testing was 44.3%, and overhead was 0.7%. Our cost of revenues may increase as a result of an\nincrease in raw material prices, any failure to obtain sufficient foundry, assembly or testing capacity or any shortage\nof processed tape or failure to improve our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield. Meanwhile, the\nlong-term capacity agreements carries the risk of substantial inventory write-downs and/or contractual penalties\nresulted from unfulfillment of committed volume in the event of decreased end customer demand. In second quarter\nof 2023, amidst strict muted market demand, we strategically terminated high-cost foundry capacity agreements, a\none-time expense included in cost of revenues. As a result, our ability to manage our wafer fabrication costs, costs\nfor processed tape, assembly and testing costs and our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield is critical to\nour performance. In addition, to mitigate declining average selling prices, we aim to reduce unit costs by, among\nother things:\nimproving product design (e.g., having smaller die size allows for a larger number of dies on each wafer,\n⚫\nthereby reducing the cost of each die);\nimproving manufacturing yields through our close collaboration with our semiconductor manufacturing\n⚫\nservice providers and in our in-house manufacturing facilities; and\nachieving better pricing from a diversified pool of semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\n⚫\nsuppliers, reflecting our ability to leverage our scale, volume requirements and close relationships as well\nas our strategy of sourcing from multiple service providers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Management\nDue to the competitive nature of the flat panel display industry and our customers’ need to maintain high\ncapacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs per panel, any delays in the delivery of our products could\nsignificantly disrupt our customers’ operations. To deliver our products on a timely basis and meet the quality\nstandards and technical specifications our customers require, we must have assurances of high-quality capacity from\nour semiconductor manufacturing service providers. We therefore strive to manage our supply chain by maintaining\nclose relationships with our key semiconductor manufacturing service providers and strive to provide credible\nforecasts of capacity demand and seek for new manufacturing service providers in case of any manufacturer’s\ncapacity shortage. Any disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our performance and could result in a\nloss of customers as well as potentially damage our reputation.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses and Cash Awards\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be\naffected by, our share-based compensation expenses and cash awards, which consist of charges taken relating to\ngrants of mainly RSUs as well as stock options, non-vested shares, and cash awards to employees.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs). We adopted two long-term incentive plans in October 2005 and September 2011,\nrespectively, which permit the grant of options or RSUs to our employees and non-employees where each unit\nrepresents two ordinary shares. The actual awards will be determined by our compensation committee. The 2005\nplan was terminated in October 2010. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding RSUs under the\nlong-term incentive plan totaling $23.8 million, $20 million and $12.1 million in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nOf the total share-based compensation expenses recognized, $23.2 million, $17.5 million and $9.5 million in 2021,\n2022 and 2023, respectively, were settled in cash. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all\nshare-based payments at fair value.\n59\nSet forth below is a summary of our historical share-based compensation plans for the years ended December\n31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. However, we did not grant RSUs in\n2019 but granted stock options to employees instead.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 97.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $3.8\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,402,714 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2020. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 98.68% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$4.8 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 2,604,545 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2021. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 85.63% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$23.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 3,987,509 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2022. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 86.41% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$17.5 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,710,607 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2023. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 97.45% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$9.5 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nThe amount of share-based compensation expense with regard to the RSUs granted to our employees on\nSeptember 26, 2018, September 28, 2020, September 28, 2021, September 28, 2022 and September 26, 2023 was\n$5.76 per ADS, $3.44 per ADS, $10.39 per ADS, $5.09 per ADS and $5.68 per ADS, respectively, which was based\non the trading price of our ADSs on that day.\nEmployee stock options. We made grants of 2,226,690 units of stock option to purchase 2,226,690 units ADS to\ncertain employees at an exercise price of $2.27 on September 30, 2019. The vesting schedule was that 50% of the\noptions vest half year after the date of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant. During\n2020, 114,500 units, 39,000 units and 10,000 units of stock option to purchase 114,500 units, 39,000 units and\n10,000 units ADS were grant to certain employees at an exercise price of $2.74, $3.9 and $3.35 on March 31, 2020,\nAugust 11, 2020 and September 25, 2020, respectively. The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1,\n2020. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding stock options under the long-term incentive\nplan totaling $0.7 million in 2020.\nCash Awards. We made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million, $19.3 million and $0.7\nmillion to the Company’s employees among which $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million was immediately\nvested on September 28, 2021, September 28, 2022 and September 26, 2023, respectively. The remainder will be\nequally vested at the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.\nTax Credits\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be\naffected by, tax credits available to us.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and development\nexpenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15% of the total qualifying\nresearch and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for the\ncurrent year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for Industrial Innovation may not be\ncarried forward.\n60\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended\nto December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10% of\nthe total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the\nincome tax payable for each year.\nDescription of Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items\nRevenues\nHistorically, we generated the majority of our revenues from sales of display drivers for large-sized applications\nand small and medium-sized applications. In addition, our product portfolio also includes timing controllers,\noperational amplifiers, LCoS microdisplay, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors, 3D sensing, ultralow\npower WiseEye smart image sensing, wafer level optics products and ASIC service.\nThe 2023 full year revenues totaled $945.4 million, representing a 21.3% decline compared to 2022. Persistent\nsubdued global demand, coupled with looming recession concerns, presented significant challenges to our\noperations throughout 2023. These market dynamics adversely affected both demand and procurement processes of\npanel customers, particularly in the realm of consumer electronics.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenues by amount and our revenues as a\npercentage of revenues by each product line:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nDisplay drivers for large-sized\napplications ............................................$.. .3..9..7..,.9 05 25.7 $263,992 22.0 $ 175,666 18.6\nDisplay drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications ........................9..6..3..,.5 37 62.3 778,946 64.8 629,174 66.5\nNon-driver products(1) ...................................1..8..5..,.6 55 12.0 158,401 13.2 140,588 14.9\nTotal ...........................................................$..1..,.5..4..7. , 097 100.0 $1,201,339 100.0 $945,428 100.0\nNote: (1) Includes, among other things, timing controllers, LCoS projector solutions, power management IC,\nCMOS image sensors, programmable gamma OP, wafer level optics (WLO) products, ultralow power\nWiseEye smart image sensing, NRE incomes, and ASIC service.\nA limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues. For example, Customer A and its\naffiliates accounted for 32.1%, 32.3% and 28.7% of our revenues in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Customer C\naccounted for 19.1%, 9.4% and 11.0% of our revenues in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCustomer A and its affiliates ..........................$.. .4..9. 7 ,083 32.1 $ 388,194 32.3 $ 271,351 28.7\nCustomer C .......................................................2..9. 5 ,217 19.1 113,396 9.4 103,839 11.0\nOthers ................................................................7..5. 4 ,797 48.8 699,749 58.3 570,238 60.3\nTotal $1,547,097 100.0 $1,201,339 100.0 $ 945,428 100.0\n61\nThe global TFT-LCD and OLED panel market is highly concentrated, with only a limited number of TFT-LCD\nand OLED panel manufacturers producing TFT-LCD and OLED panels in high volumes. We sell panel display\ndrivers to many of these panel manufacturers. Our revenues, therefore, will depend on our ability to capture an\nincreasingly larger percentage of each panel manufacturer’s display driver requirements. The sales to panel makers\nin China have become a significant portion of our revenue due to the Chinese panel maker business expansion which\nstarted in 2011. We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales to Asia-based customers whose end products\nare sold worldwide. In 2021, 2022 and 2023, approximately 14.2%, 14.6% and 15.0% of our revenues, respectively,\nwere from customers headquartered in Taiwan and approximately 81.5%, 77.0% and 76.2% of our revenues,\nrespectively, were from customers headquartered in China. We believe that substantially all of our revenues will\ncontinue to be from customers located in Asia, where almost all of the panel manufacturers and mobile device\nmodule manufacturers are located. As a result of the regional customer concentration, we expect to continue to be\nsubject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in Asia. A substantial\nmajority of our sales invoices are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of revenues, research and development expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses, share-based compensation expenses and cash awards. Costs\nwould be greatly affected by product mix.\nCost of Revenues\nThe principal items of our cost of revenues are:\ncost of wafer fabrication;\n⚫\ncost of processed tape used in TAB packaging;\n⚫\ncost of gold bumping, assembly and testing; and\n⚫\nother costs and expenses.\n⚫\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductors and semiconductor solutions to semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers. The costs of wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing depend on the\navailability of capacity and demand for such services. The wafer fabrication industry, in particular, is highly cyclical,\nresulting in fluctuations in the price of processed wafers depending on the available foundry capacity and the\ndemand for foundry services.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of research and development employee salaries,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, costs associated with prototype wafers, processed tape, masks, molding\nand tooling sets and depreciation on research and development equipment. We expect to continue increasing our\nspending on research and development in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue to increase our\nresearch and development headcount and associated costs to pursue additional product development opportunities.\nAs a percentage of revenues, our research and development expenses in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were 9.8%, 14.6% and\n18.1%, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of general and administrative employees,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, depreciation on buildings, office furniture and equipment and professional\nfees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we\nexpand our operations, hire additional administrative personnel and incur additional compliance costs required of a\npublicly listed company in the United States.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries of sales and marketing employees, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, travel expenses and product sample costs. We expect that our sales and marketing\n62\nexpenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts over the next several years. However, we believe that as we\ncontinue to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies, our sales and marketing expenses may\ndecline over time as a percentage of our revenues.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur share-based compensation expenses consist of various forms of share-based compensation that we have\nhistorically issued to our employees and consultants, as well as share-based compensation issued to employees,\ndirectors and service providers under our 2005 and 2011 long-term incentive plans. The 2005 plan was terminated in\nOctober 2010. We allocate such share-based compensation expenses to the applicable cost of revenues and expense\ncategories as related services are performed. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Under the\nlong-term incentive plan, we granted RSUs on December 30, 2005 to our employees and directors and again on\nSeptember 29, 2006, September 26, 2007, September 29, 2008, September 28, 2009, September 28, 2010,\nSeptember 28, 2011, September 26, 2012, September 26, 2013, September 26, 2014, September 25, 2015,\nSeptember 28, 2016, September 29, 2017, September 26, 2018, September 28, 2020, September 28, 2021,\nSeptember 28, 2022 and September 26, 2023 to our employees. We did not grant RSUs in 2019 but granted stock\noptions to employees instead. Share-based compensation expenses recorded regarding RSUs under the long-term\nincentive plan totaled $23.8 million, $20.0 million and $12.1 million in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nCash Awards.\nWe made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million, $19.3 million and $0.7 million to the\nCompany’s employees among which $1.6 million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million was immediately vested on\nSeptember 28, 2021, September 28, 2022 and September 26, 2023, respectively. The remainder will be equally\nvested at the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries are incorporated in different jurisdictions, we file separate\nincome tax returns. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However, if\nthe relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be determined\nto be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income Tax Act and\nrelevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax in the ROC.\nWe recognize income taxes at the applicable statutory rates in accordance with the jurisdictions where our\nsubsidiaries are located and as adjusted for certain items including accumulated losses carried forward,\nnon-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits, as well as changes in our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used\nin the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and we use judgment and estimate to\ndetermine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period. Due to the rapid technological\nchanges, we estimate the net realizable value of inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of\nreporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon. The\ninventory write-downs in 2021, 2022 and 2023 were approximately $9.4 million, $22.2 million and $21.5 million,\nrespectively, and were included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-financial Assets other than Goodwill\nWe routinely review our non-financial assets at the reporting date to determine whether there is any indication\nof impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable\namount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In\n63\nassessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount\nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. However,\ndue to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy, market requirements, or the needs of\nour customers, we may not always be in a position to accurately anticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or\nacquired technology until they occur. Although we have the recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we\nremain positive on the long-term prospect of our non-Driver product segment, judging by the expanding customer\nlist that covers some of the world’s biggest tech names, and the busy engineering activities going on with such\ncustomers. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we did not recognize any impairment loss on\nnon-financial assets.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the\ncash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of\nthe Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss.\nAn impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The assessment of\nimpairment of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgment to determine the identified CGU,\nallocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of\nestimating the recoverable amount of relevant CGU, management is required to make subjective judgments in\ndetermining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future\nrevenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, goodwill in Driver IC CGU and WLO CGU was $26,846 thousand and\n$1,292 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nAccording to the ROC Income Tax Act, dividends distributed by a Taiwan company to its foreign shareholders\nare subject to ROC withholding tax, currently at the rate of 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash\ndividends or on the par value of the ordinary shares in the case of stock dividends. The surtax rate for undistributed\nearnings is currently 5%. However, surtax paid on undistributed earnings can no longer be used to offset against the\nwithholding tax imposed on the dividend distributed to foreign shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have not provided for retained earnings tax on the undistributed earnings of\napproximately $1,307.4 million of our subsidiaries since we have specific plans to reinvest these earnings\nindefinitely. The undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are mainly from Himax Taiwan totaling\napproximately $1,305.9 million as of December 31, 2023. We intend to use accumulated and future earnings of\nHimax Taiwan to expand operations in Taiwan.\nHowever, a deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Taiwanese company can no longer demonstrate\nthat it plans to reinvest indefinitely these undistributed earnings. This amount becomes taxable when we execute\nother investments, share buybacks or shareholder dividends to be funded by cash distribution by our foreign\nsubsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such\nundistributed earnings.\nWe are a holding company located in the Cayman Islands and have paid dividends and repurchased outstanding\nshares. To fund such dividends and repurchases, in the past years, we have received cash from bank loans and from\nHimax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings instead of dividends distributed by Himax Taiwan.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required to\nestimate income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities for us and our subsidiaries. This process involves\nestimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of\nitems for tax and accounting purposes and the amount of tax credits and tax loss carry-forward. These differences\nresult in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n64\nManagement must then assess deferred tax assets at each reporting date and reduce to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future\ntaxable profits improves.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of profit or loss as a percentage of\nrevenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nRevenues.................................................................................................................1 00.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues .................................................................................................. 51.6 59.5 72.1\nResearch and development .................................................................................. 9.8 14.6 18.1\nGeneral and administrative .................................................................................. 1.9 2.4 2.7\nSales and marketing ............................................................................................. 1.5 2.1 2.5\nTotal costs and expenses ......................................................................................... 64.8 78.6 95.4\nOperating income ................................................................................................... 35.2 21.4 4.6\nNon-operating income (loss) .................................................................................. - 1.6 0.1\nIncome tax expense (benefit) ................................................................................ 7.2 3.4 (0.5)\nProfit for the year .................................................................................................... 28.0 19.6 5.2\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interests ........................................................... 0.2 0.1 0.2\nProfit attributable to Himax stockholders ............................................................... 28.2 19.7 5.4\nYear to Year Comparisons\nYear Ended December 31,\n% Change\n2021 2022 2023 from 2022\n(in thousands, except for percentages)\nConsolidated Statements of Profit or Loss\nData:\nRevenues .............................................................. ..... $1,547,097 $1,201,339 $ 945,428 (21.3)%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues ............................................... ..... 798,519 714,233 681,931 (4.5)%\nResearch and development ............................... ..... 151,386 175,557 171,392 (2.4)%\nGeneral and administrative ............................... ..... 29,281 28,503 25,037 (12.2)%\nExpected credit loss .......................................... .....

Our revenues decreased by 21.3% to $945.4 million in 2023 compared to $1,201.3 million in 2022.\nAll three main business sectors experienced a year-over-year decline due to persistent subdued global demand,\n65\nlooming recession concerns, and price erosion, a requisite part of the inventory offloading process, all presented\nchallenges to our operations throughout 2023. These market dynamics adversely affected both the demand and\nprocurement processes of panel customers, particularly in the realm of consumer electronics.\nLarge-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from display drivers for large-sized application decreased by 33.5%\n⚫\nto $175.7 million in 2023 from $264.0 million in 2022. The decline was predominantly driven by the\nprevailing weak macroeconomic conditions that our customers across the board, from brands to panel\nhouses, maintained their cautious approach with heightened procurement scrutiny on the backdrop of\nslowing end market sell-through.\nSmall and Medium-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from small and medium-sized display drivers\n⚫\ndecreased by 19.2% to $629.2 million in 2023 from $778.9 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily a\nresult of lackluster demand in the market. Soft consumer consumption, coupled with recession fears persists\nas a challenge to market demand and amplifies uncertainty in the tech industry. Sales of smartphones and\ntablets were particularly affected by these challenging conditions. Furthermore, our automotive sector sales\ndeclined due to intensified electric vehicle price competition, especially in the second quarter of 2023,\nprompting major Chinese automakers to cut production and implement strict cost-saving measures. Despite\nthese challenges, our optimism in the automotive business remains strong, with automotive TDDI sales\nexperiencing a remarkable surge of over 50% in 2023, underscoring the resilience and potential of our\nlargest business segment. Our automotive TDDI business secured over 400 design-win projects, while our\nautomotive LTDI product began production for Geely Auto's NEVs in the third quarter of 2023, all\nsolidifying our leadership as additional projects set to commence production in the next 1 or 2 years.\nNon-Driver Products. Revenues from non-driver products decreased by 11.2% to $140.5 million in 2023\n⚫\nfrom $158.4 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly from the decline of TCON sales, hampered by\ndecreased demand for both large display panels and OLED displays for tablet, but partially offset by the\nincrease of WLO and CMOS image sensor. Despite the soft market sentiment, we are actively developing\nthe next generation TCON IC for OLED tablets, notebooks, and automotive applications, aiming to\ndiversify our offerings and strategically position ourselves for a resurgence in demand. In our automotive\nTCON business, our position remains unchallenged in local dimming TCON, as evidenced by growing\nvalidation and widespread deployment globally in both premium and mainstream new car models. We plan\nto roll out a series of TCON products for automotive to expand our offerings catering to the diverse needs\nof global customers. Local dimming technology has found increasing application in automotive displays,\ninitially in high-end car models and gradually in mainstream vehicles, with emerging use cases in heads-up\ndisplays (HUD).\nCosts and Expenses. Costs and expenses decreased by 4.4% to $902.2 million in 2023 from $943.8 million in\n2022. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased to 95.4% in 2023 compared to 78.6% in 2022.\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased to $681.9 million in 2023 from $714.2 million in 2022,\n⚫\nwhich was due primarily to a 3.1% decrease in unit shipments in 2023. As a percentage of revenues, cost of\nrevenues increased to 72.1% in 2023 from 59.5% in 2022, mainly due to market price erosion on the\nbackdrop of sluggish end market demand as well as cautious inventory management and rigorous\nprocurement scrutiny by customers, particularly in the realm of consumer electronics. Aggressive\ndestocking, strategic termination of certain high-cost foundry capacity agreements, and the write-down of\nunsold inventories due to market price declines have all contributed to higher costs of revenues.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by 2.4% to $171.4 million in\n⚫\n2023 from $175.6 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to the lower vested portion of\nthe annual bonus compensation awarded to employees in 2023 and preceding years, but partially offset by\nincreased salaries and tape-out expenses. The increase in salary expense was due primarily to a larger\nheadcount of research and development staff and higher average salaries, but partially offset by NT dollar\ndepreciation against the US dollar as we pay the bulk of our employee salaries in NT dollars.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 12.2% to $25.0 million in\n⚫\n2023 from $28.5 million in 2022, primarily as a result of decreases in compensation awards to employees\ndescribed in above Research and Development and professional fees.\n66\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 6.3% to $23.9 million in 2023 from $25.5\n⚫\nmillion in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to decrease in compensation awards to employees\ndescribed in above Research and Development, but partially offset by increase in travelling expense.\nNon-Operating Income (loss). We had net non-operating income of $1.2 million in 2023 compared to $19.0\nmillion in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to a gain from disposal of a subsidiary in 2022, decrease in foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and increase in finance costs but partially offset by an increase in interest income.\nIncome Tax Expense (benefit). Our income tax benefit increased to $5.0 million in 2023 from income tax\nexpense of $41.1 million in 2022. Our effective income tax rate decreased to (11.3%) in 2023 from 14.9% in 2022.\nThe decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in pre-tax profit,\nfrom $276.6 million in 2022 to $44.4 million in 2023 and income tax benefit for tax credit decreased to $9.9 million\nin 2023 from $15.6 million in 2022. Additionally, there was a combined recognized income tax benefit of $4.0\nmillion in 2023 but income tax expense of $0.6 million in 2022, for changes in unrecognized tax benefits and\nvariances resulting from prior years’ income.\nProfit for the year. As a result of the foregoing, our profit was $49.4 million in 2023, versus $235.5 million in\n2022, and profit attributable to Himax stockholders was $50.6 million in 2023, versus $237.0 million in 2022.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth the revenues and operating results for our reportable segments for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nSegment Revenues ..................................................................................................\nDriver IC .......................................................................................................$..1..,.3. 6 1,442 $1,042,938 $ 804,840\nNon-Driver Products ..................................................................................... ....1..8 5,655 158,401 140,588\nTotal ..................................................................................................................$..1..,.5. 4 7,097 $1,201,339 $ 945,428\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\nDriver IC .......................................................................................................$.. ..5..5 1,943 $ 275,275 $ 75,282\nNon-Driver Products ..................................................................................... ......

Our revenues from the Driver IC segment decreased by 22.8% to $804.8 million in 2023\nfrom $1,042.9 million in 2022. The decline stemmed from reduced sales of display drivers for both large-sized and\nsmall and medium-sized sectors, driven by the prevailing weak macroeconomic conditions that adversely affected\nboth the demand for and procurement processes of panel customers, especially within the consumer electronics\nsector.\nSegment operating income. Operating income from the Driver IC segment decreased to $75.3 million in 2023\nfrom $275.3 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues and lower gross\nmargin, which was mainly attributable to pricing pressure, largely stemming from pricing pressure caused by the\nneed to offload excess inventory levels amid challenging economic conditions.\nNon-Driver Products Segment\n67\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased by 11.2% to $140.6 million\nin 2023 from $158.4 million in 2022. The year-over-year decrease was mainly from decline in TCON revenues, but\npartially offset by the increase of WLO and CMOS imaging sensor.\nSegment operating loss. Operating loss from the Non-Driver Products segment increased to $32.1 million in\n2023 from $17.7 million in 2022. The operating loss increases were attributable mainly to the decline in revenues\nand gross margin.\n5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe need cash primarily for technology advancement, capacity expansion, paying dividends and working capital.\nWe have historically been able to meet our cash requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings to\npay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had total current assets of $1,200.6 million, total current liabilities of $708.8\nmillion and cash and cash equivalents of $191.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, we had short-term secured\nborrowings of $453.0 million with cash and time deposits of $453.0 million as collateral, and long-term unsecured\nborrowings of $40.5 million, of which $6.0 million was current portion. For enhancing the guaranty, our land,\nbuilding and improvements of Fab 2 totaling $63.4 million were pledged as collateral for the long-term unsecured\nborrowings. As of December 31, 2023, we had total unused short-term credit lines of $206.5 million, of which\n$127.0 million belonging to the parent company, Himax Technologies, Inc., needs to be secured with an equal\namount of cash and time deposits when borrowing money from banks. Further, we had unused long-term credit lines\nof $139.5 million. We believe that our existing short-term and long-term credit lines, together with cash generated\nfrom our operations, are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to meet our present working capital\nrequirements through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities .........................................................$.. ..3..8. 8 ,276 $ 82,908 $ 152,841\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities .............................................(.2..3. 2 ,680) 14,998 (88,882)\nNet cash (used in) financing activities .....................................................................( 4 ,487) (211,068) (93,591)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents ...........................................1..5. 1 ,086 (114,443) (29,832)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period ................................................1..8. 4 ,938 336,024 221,581\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period ..........................................................3..3. 6 ,024 221,581 191,749\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $152.8 million compared to $82.9\nmillion in 2022. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was mainly due to the substantial\nreduction in inventory across major product lines.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 was $88.9 million compared to net cash\nprovided by investing activities $15.0 million in 2022. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was due\nprimarily to an increase of $50.8 million in refundable deposits made for securing foundry capacity, an increase of\n$20.9 million in net cash used in acquisitions of financial assets at amortized cost in 2023 compared to 2022 and an\nincrease in cash used in acquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $11.6 million.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2023 was $93.6 million compared to $211.1\nmillion in 2022. This change was due primarily to decrease in distribution of cash dividends in 2023 and a decrease\nof guarantee deposits received from customers.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products that are subject to rapid\ntechnological change, among other factors, which could result in revenue variability in future periods. In addition,\nwe have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of our customers. The extension of payment terms\nfor our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results. Our subsidiaries’ ability\nto distribute dividends and other payments to us may be limited by ROC regulations. See “Risk Factors — Risks\n68\nRelated to Our Holding Company Structure — Our ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from\nour subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and\nconduct our business.”\nDuring the 2021 timeframe, we took steps to address the ongoing foundry capacity shortage worldwide by\nentering into strategic agreements with our foundry partners to secure the necessary capacity to meet our business\nrequirements. Under these strategic agreements, we are committed to purchasing a specific volume at fixed prices or\nvariable prices. Some of our customers, and even our indirect customers, are also entering into similar strategic\nagreements to secure their IC supplies with us. However, there can be no assurance that these prices provided in the\nstrategic agreements with our foundry partners and our customers will always remain competitive during the\ncontract term. For example, in the event that the global semiconductor market changes due to foundry capacity\nexpansion and/or shrunken customer demand, the fixed prices we agree to pay our foundry partners may become\nsignificantly higher than the then prevailing market price. On the other hand, if there continues to be foundry\ncapacity shortages and/or increases in customer demand, the fixed prices our customers agree to pay us may become\nsignificantly lower than the then prevailing market price. Any of those situations could materially adversely impact\nour pricing strategies, competitive position, profitability and results of operation. We may also be subject to\ncontractual penalties if we are unable to purchase the committed volume from our foundry partners. However, after\nseveral quarters of aggressive destocking, our inventory has reached a comfortable level. In light of this, we\nstrategically terminated certain high-cost foundry capacity agreements in the second quarter of 2023, prior to their\nexpiration dates. This move aims to improve our cost structure for new wafer starts and maintain competitiveness.\nThis, however, also has resulted in a significant one-time early termination expense incurred in the second quarter of\n2023 and hit our gross margin. In addition, since these strategic agreements with our foundry partners typically\nrequire us to make prepayments or refundable deposits to such foundry partners, our cash flow, liquidity and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into several wafer fabrication or assembly and testing service arrangements or multi-year\npurchase agreements with suppliers. We may be obligated to make payments for purchase orders entered into\npursuant to these arrangements. Our purchase obligations also include agreements to purchase goods or services,\nprimarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including\nfixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the\ntransaction. Among all these purchase agreements, the longest termination term shall expire in 2028. Purchase\nobligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Contractual obligations resulting from above\npurchase orders and agreements with known amounts approximate $1,415 million as of December 31, 2023.

The following description of the plan is intended to be a summary and does not\ndescribe all provisions of the plan.\nPurpose of the Plan. The purpose of the plan is to advance our interests and those of our shareholders by:\nproviding the opportunity for our employees, directors and service providers to develop a sense of\n⚫\nproprietorship and personal involvement in our development and financial success and to devote their best\nefforts to our business; and\nproviding us with a means through which we may attract able individuals to become our employees or to\n⚫\nserve as our directors or service providers and providing us a means whereby those individuals, upon whom\nthe responsibilities of our successful administration and management are of importance, can acquire and\nmaintain share ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for our welfare.\nType of Awards. The plan provides for the grant of stock options and restricted share units.\nDuration. Generally, the plan will terminate five years from the effective date of the plan. But, the amended and\nrestated 2011 Plan was 3rd amended and restated by extending its duration for three (3) years to September 6, 2025,\nwhich was approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting held on August 16, 2022. After the plan is\nterminated, no awards may be granted, but any award previously granted will remain outstanding in accordance with\nthe plan.\nAdministration. The plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors or any other\ncommittee designated by our board to administer the plan. Committee members will be appointed from time to time\nby, and will serve at the discretion of, our board. The committee has full power and authority to interpret the terms\nand intent of the plan or any agreement or document in connection with the plan, determine eligibility for awards\nand adopt such rules, regulations, forms, instruments and guidelines for administering the plan. The committee may\ndelegate its duties or powers.\nNumber of Authorized Shares. We have authorized a maximum issuance of 36,153,854 shares in the 2005 plan\nand 20,000,000 shares in the 2011 plan, and the 2005 plan was terminated in October 2010. As of the date of this\n78\nannual report, there were no stock options or restricted share units outstanding under the plan except as described\nunder “—Stock Options” and “—Restricted Share Units.”\nEligibility and Participation. All of our employees, directors and service providers are eligible to participate in\nthe plan. The committee may select from all eligible individuals those individuals to whom awards will be granted\nand will determine the nature of any and all terms permissible by law and the amount of each award.\nStock Options. The committee may grant options to participants in such number, upon such terms and at any\ntime as it determines. Each option grant will be evidenced by an award document that will specify the exercise price,\nthe maximum duration of the option, the number of shares to which the option pertains, conditions upon which the\noption will become vested and exercisable and such other provisions which are not inconsistent with the plan.\nThe exercise price for each option will be:\nbased on 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant;\n⚫\nset at a premium to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant; or\n⚫\nindexed to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, with the committee determining the\n⚫\nindex.\nThe exercise price on the date of grant must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the shares on\nthe date of grant.\nEach option will expire at such time as the committee determines at the time of its grant; however, no option\nwill be exercisable later than the 10th anniversary of its grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for options\ngranted to participants outside the United States, the committee can set options that have terms greater than ten\nyears.\nOptions will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such terms and conditions as the committee approves.\nA condition of the delivery of shares as to which an option will be exercised will be the payment of the exercise\nprice. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of written notification of\nexercise and full payment, we will deliver to the participant evidence of book-entry shares or, upon his or her\nrequest, share certificates in an appropriate amount based on the number of shares purchased under the option(s).\nThe committee may impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option as it may\ndeem advisable.\nEach participant’s award document will set forth the extent to which he or she will have the right to exercise the\noptions following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 2,226,690 units employee stock options to our certain employees on September 30, 2019\nwith exercise price $2.27 per option.

The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1, 2020.\nRestricted Share Units. The committee may grant restricted share units to participants. Each grant will be\nevidenced by an award document that will specify the period(s) of restriction, the number of restricted share units\ngranted and such other provisions as the committee determines.\nGenerally, restricted share units will become freely transferable after all conditions and restrictions applicable to\nsuch shares have been satisfied or lapse and restricted share units will be paid in cash, shares or a combination of the\ntwo, as determined by the committee.\nThe committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any restricted share units as it may deem\nadvisable, including a requirement that participants pay a stipulated purchase price for each restricted share unit,\nrestrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance goals and time-based restrictions on vesting.\nA participant will have no voting rights with respect to any restricted share units.\n79\nEach award document will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to retain restricted\nshare units following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018.

Dividend equivalents will be converted to cash or additional shares by such formula and at such\ntime and subject to such limitations as determined by the committee.\nOn November 9, 2022, the Company’s compensation committee made the unvested RSUs generally include\nforfeitable dividend-equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders\nof common stock. The dividend-equivalent rights are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as\nthe underlying RSUs.\nTransferability of Awards.

Major Shareholders\nOn August 10, 2009, we effected certain changes in our capital stock structure in order to meet the Taiwan\nStock Exchange’s primary listing requirement that the par value of shares be NT$10 or $0.3 per share and in order to\nincrease the number of outstanding ordinary shares to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In particular, we\nincreased our authorized share capital from $50,000 (divided into 500,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) to\n$300,000,000 (divided into 3,000,000,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) and distributed 5,999 bonus shares\nfor each share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. These were followed by a\nconsolidation of every 3,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each into one ordinary share of par value $0.3 each. As a\nresult, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was doubled and each of our ordinary shares had a par value of\n$0.3.\nIn connection with the above changes, we also changed our ADS ratio effective August 10, 2009 from one ADS\nrepresenting one ordinary share to one ADS representing two ordinary shares. Such change in ADS ratio was\nintended to adjust for the net dilutive effect due to the bonus shares distribution and the shares consolidation so that\neach ADS would represent the same percentage ownership in our share capital immediately before and after the\nabove changes. The number of ADSs also remained the same immediately before and after the above changes.\nAs of March 31, 2024, 349,448,102 of our shares were outstanding. We believe that, of such shares,\n211,972,946 shares in the form of ADSs were registered in the name of a nominee of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nthe depositary under our ADS deposit agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., advised us that, as of March 31,\n2024, 105,986,473 ADSs, representing 211,972,946 common shares, were held of record by Cede & Co. and 10\nother registered shareholders domiciled in and outside of the United States. We have no further information as to\ncommon shares held, or beneficially owned, by U.S. persons.\nThe following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as\nof March 31, 2024, the most recent practicable date, by (i) each shareholder known by us to beneficially own more\nthan 5% of our shares and (ii) all directors and executive officers as a group.\n81\nPercentage of\nShares\nNumber of Shares Beneficially\nName of Beneficial Owner Beneficially Owned(3) Owned(3)\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu(1) .............................................................................. 76,904,468 22.0%\nWhei-Lan Teng(2) .................................................................................... 22,847,370 6.5%\nAll directors and executive officers as a group(3) ...................................... 85,395,557 24.4%\nNote: (1) Dr. Biing-Seng Wu directly owns 315,322 ordinary shares.

Ltd. and (b) 20,039,838 ordinary shares through Chi-Duan Investment Co.\nLtd. All of the three entities are investment companies controlled by Biing-Seng Wu. Accordingly, Dr.\nBiing-Seng Wu may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 76,904,468 ordinary shares,\nrepresenting approximately 22.0% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(2) Whei-Lan Teng beneficially owns 5,434,918 ordinary shares through Renmar Finance Limited, a wholly\nowned subsidiary of Pleione Technology Investment Pte.

Accordingly, Whei-Lan Teng may be deemed to beneficially own an\naggregate of 22,847,370 ordinary shares, representing approximately 6.5% of the outstanding ordinary\nshares.\n(3) Numbers of shares beneficially owned by all directors and executive officers as a group already include\nan aggregate of 76,904,468 ordinary shares beneficially owned by Dr. Biing-Seng Wu.\nNone of our major shareholders has voting rights different from those of other shareholders.

These were adopted primarily in connection with our\nproposed Taiwan listing to meet the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s primary listing requirement concerning protection of\nmaterial shareholders’ rights under the ROC’s Company Act and Securities Exchange Act. At the same time, our\nshareholders also adopted the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were\nfiled as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 with the SEC on\nJune 3, 2010 and are substantially the same as the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nof our company except that our authorized share capital is stated to be $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000\nshares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each, on the condition that it shall become effective if the application made by\nour company to list its ordinary shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange is rejected or aborted. On May 20, 2010, the\nThird Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association became effective as a result of the\ntermination of our primary listing application to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\nWe incorporate by reference into this annual report the description of our Amended and Restated Memorandum\nand Articles of Association (except for provisions relating to our authorized share capital) contained in our F-1\nregistration statement (File No. 333-132372) filed with the SEC on March 13, 2006. Such description sets forth a\nsummary of certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association as currently in effect, which is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles\nof Association. As of the date of this annual report, our authorized share capital is $300,000,000 divided into\n1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each.\n10.C. Material Contracts\nWe are not currently, and have not been in the last two years, party to any material contract, other than contracts\nentered into the ordinary course of business.\n10.D. Exchange Controls\nWe have extracted from publicly available documents the information presented in this section. The information\nbelow may be applicable because our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, is incorporated in the\nROC. Please note that citizens of the PRC and entities organized in the PRC are subject to special ROC laws, rules\nand regulations, which are not discussed in this section.\nThe ROC’s Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions\nmust be executed by banks designated to handle foreign exchange transactions by the Central Bank of the ROC.\nThere is an annual limit on the amount of currency a Taiwanese entity may convert into, or out of, NT dollars other\nthan for trade purposes. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.\nWith regard to inward and outward remittances (foreign exchange purchased or sold), approval by the Central\nBank of the ROC is generally required for any conversion exceeding, in aggregate in each calendar year, $50 million\n(and /or its equivalent settlement) for companies and $5 million (and/or its equivalent settlement) for Taiwanese\ncitizen and long term 1 year-valid resident permit of foreign individuals. A requirement is also imposed on all\nprivate enterprises to report all medium- and long-term foreign debt with the Central Bank of the ROC.\nIn addition, a foreign person without an alien resident card or an unrecognized foreign entity may remit to and\nfrom Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $100,000 per remittance if required documentation is provided to the ROC\nauthorities. This limit applies only to remittances involving a conversion between NT dollars and U.S. dollars or\nother foreign currencies.\n85\n10.E. Taxation\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains\nor appreciation, and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely\nto be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be\napplicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman\nIslands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in\nthe Cayman Islands.\nWe have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, obtained\nan undertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:\n(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or gains or\nappreciations shall apply to us or our operations;\n(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our\nordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.\nThe undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from May 3, 2005.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders described\nbelow of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive\ndescription of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to hold the securities. This\ndiscussion applies only to a U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. This discussion does not address any aspect of the “Medicare contributions tax” on “net investment\nincome.” In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the U.S.\nHolder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences\napplicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:\ncertain financial institutions;\n⚫\ndealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;\n⚫\npersons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion\n⚫\ntransaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the ordinary\nshares or ADSs;\npersons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;\n⚫\nentities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n⚫\ntax-exempt entities, including “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”;\n⚫\npersons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of our voting stock; or\n⚫\npersons holding ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the\n⚫\nUnited States.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares or\nADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ordinary shares or ADSs and partners in such partnerships should\nconsult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the\nordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative pronouncements,\njudicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof. These laws are\nsubject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on representations by the depositary and\n86\nassumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in\naccordance with its terms. You should consult your tax adviser concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S.\ntax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a person that is, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ordinary\nshares or ADSs and is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a\ncorporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; or (iii)\nan estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the\nunderlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S.\nHolder exchanges ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.\nThe U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released before\ndelivery of shares to the depositary (“pre-release”) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of\nforeign tax credits for U.S. holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the\nclaiming of the preferred rates of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate\nU.S. holders. Accordingly, the availability of the preferential tax rates for dividends received by certain\nnon-corporate U.S. Holders, described below, could be affected by actions taken by parties to whom ADSs are\npre-released.\nThis discussion assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company (as\ndiscussed below).\nTaxation of Distributions\nDistributions received by U.S. Holders with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs, other than certain pro rata\ndistributions of ordinary shares, will constitute foreign-source dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nto the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined in accordance with U.S.\nfederal income tax principles. We do not to maintain records of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal\nincome tax principles, and therefore it is expected that distributions will generally be reported to U.S. Holders as\ndividends. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s (or in the case of\nADSs, the depository’s) receipt of the dividends. Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion above\nregarding concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury, certain dividends paid by qualified foreign corporations to\ncertain non-corporate holders may be taxable at preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A foreign\ncorporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on stock that is readily\ntradable on a securities market in the United States, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where our ADSs\nare traded. Our ordinary shares are not traded on a securities market in the United States. Non-corporate U.S.\nHolders of our ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their tax advisers regarding their eligibility for taxation at\nsuch preferential rates and whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at such\npreferential rates. Corporate U.S. Holders will not be entitled to claim the dividends-received deduction with respect\nto dividends paid by us.\nSale and Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\nA U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on\nthe sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary\nshares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders\nmay be taxable at preferential rates. The amount of gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount\nrealized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nWe believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn general, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in\nwhich (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties)\nor (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the\n87\nproduction of, passive income (including cash). If a corporation owns at least 25% (by value) of the stock of another\ncorporation, the corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning its proportionate share of the\n25%-owned subsidiary’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s income. As\nPFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets from time to time\n(and the value of our assets may be determined, in part, based on the market price of our shares and ADSs, which\nmay fluctuate considerably from time to time given that market prices of certain technology companies historically\nhave been volatile), there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year.\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held ordinary shares or ADSs, certain\nadverse U.S. federal income tax rules would apply on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of ordinary\nshares or ADSs by the U.S. Holder. In general, under those rules, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or\nother disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any\nyear before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year\nwould be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable\nyear, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax attributable to such allocated amounts. Similar rules would\napply to any distribution in respect of ordinary shares or ADSs to the extent in excess of 125% of the average of the\nannual distributions on ordinary shares or ADSs received by the U.S. Holder during the preceding three years or the\nU.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter. Certain elections may be available that would result in\nalternative treatments (such as a mark-to-market treatment of the ADSs). U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisers to determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the consequences of the\nalternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances.\nIf we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year, the preferential tax\nrates discussed above with respect to dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders would not apply.\nIn addition, if a U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares or ADSs during any year in which we are a PFIC, the U.S.\nHolder may be required to file certain information reports, containing such information as the U.S. Treasury may\nrequire.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related\nfinancial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding,\nunless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any\nbackup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is\ntimely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\n10.F.

Annual Report to Security Holders\nNot applicable.\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates is primarily the interest income\ngenerated by our cash deposited with banks. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks related to bank\nborrowings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. The U.S. dollar is also the functional\ncurrency for the majority of our operations. In 2023, more than 99% of our sales and cost of revenues were\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. However, in December 2023 approximately 70% of our operating expenses were\ndenominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Chinese\nRenminbi, and the majority of the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. We anticipate that we will continue to\nconduct substantially all of our sales in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that we have a material currency risk with\nregard to the NT dollar. We believe the majority of any potential adverse foreign currency exchange impacts on our\noperating assets may be offset by a potential favorable foreign currency exchange impact on our operating liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, forward contracts to hedge against our\nforeign currency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2023, no foreign currency exchange contracts are outstanding.\nITEM 12.

The depositary collects\nfees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a\nportion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for depositary services by\ndeduction from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or charging the book-entry system accounts of\nparticipants acting for them. The depositary may collect any of its fees by deduction from any cash distribution\npayable to ADS holders that are obligated to pay those fees. The depositary may generally refuse to provide\nfee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid.\nFrom time to time, the depositary may make payments to us to reimburse and/or share revenue from the fees\ncollected from ADS holders, or waive fees and expenses for services provided, generally relating to costs and\nexpenses arising out of establishment and maintenance of the ADS program. In performing its duties under the\ndeposit agreement, the depositary may use brokers, dealers or other service providers that are affiliates of the\ndepositary and that may earn or share fees or commissions.\nFees and Other Payments from the Depositary to Us\nIn 2023, we received $0.6 million netting of 30% withholding tax from the depositary relating to the ADR\nprogram. The payment from the depositary would be intended to cover certain of our expenses incurred in relation to\nthe ADR program for the year, including:\nlegal, audit and other fees incurred in connection with preparation of Form 20-F and annual reports and\n⚫\nongoing SEC compliance and listing requirements;\ndirector and officer insurance;\n⚫\nstock exchange listing fees;\n⚫\nnon-deal roadshow expenses;\n⚫\ncosts incurred by financial printer and share certificate printer;\n⚫\npostage for communications to ADR holders;\n⚫\ncosts of retaining third-party public relations, investor relations and/or corporate communications advisory\n⚫\nfirms in the U.S.; and\ncosts incurred in connection with participation in retail investor shows and capital markets days.\n⚫\n90\nAppointment of New Depositary Bank\nOn July 14, 2017, we appointed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as our new American depositary receipt bank.\nEffective the same day, our ADR program was officially transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for a contract\nterm of ten years.\nPART II\nITEM 13.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\nIFRS as issued by the IASB.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\n⚫\nand dispositions of our assets;\nprovide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our\n⚫\nfinancial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\n⚫\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of our chief executive and chief financial officers, assessed the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act)\nas of December 31, 2023 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control ± Integrated Framework (2013) issued by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control ± Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and\n2023, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash\nflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the\n“consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated April 2, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit\nalso included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nTo strengthen information security, our company collaborated with Deloitte Taiwan, a third-party consulting\nfirm, in 2023. Furthermore, to enhance risk management procedures, our company is currently implementing\ndeploys the Risk Assessment Work Instructions, the Network and Communication Management Work Instructions,\nand the Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery Management Work Instructions. These instructions are utilized\nfor executing risk management and assessment strategies, implementing network control measures, and establishing\nprocedures for information security incident grading and reporting.\n94\nAs the frequency of network hacker attacks increases, our company continues to implement strict preventive\nmeasures against network attacks. These measures encompass firewall intrusion detection and prevention, internal\nand external network access control, regular updates of antivirus software, physical management of information\nequipment, and regular updates of information equipment. Our object is to ensure a secure R&D environment and\nmitigate operational risks.\nFor additional information regarding risks to the Company from cybersecurity threats. See “Risk Factors —\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Business —System security risks, data protection breaches or\nunexpected system outages or failures could impact our business.”\nGovernance\nOur company has established an information security committee, chaired by the Deputy General Manager of the\nBusiness and Operation Center and composing representatives of the heads of each division of the Company. The\ncommittee coordinates various information security control measures and information security management\nstrategies. Furthermore, the committee has formed a task-force emergency response team, tasked with severity of\nsuspected information security incidents. In the event of a major network security incident, the team will conduct\ndamage control, restoration, root cause analysis, investigation, and improvement activities. Furthermore, the\ncommittee also has established an information security management team, encompassing representatives from the\ninformation department and each division of the Company. The team is responsible for facilitating and\nimplementing policy discussions, policy tracking, and other implementation tasks.\nOur company’s information security committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors annually on the\noutcome of the Company’s information security initiatives. The report includes internal and external environmental\nrisks- related to information security incident investigation and handling, plans for managing high-risk information\nsecurity incidents, and annual information security plans. The committee also conducts network security awareness\ntraining for Board members every year to enhance the Board's expertise in information security governance.\nIn 2023, our company did not experience any major information security incidents. In addition to annual\ninformation security awareness training, our company conducted four information security tests to reinforce\nemployee awareness. To ensure the effective implementation of information security policies, all employees who\nparticipated in the information security tests successfully met the established qualification criteria.\nPART III\nITEM 17.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n(With Report of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm Thereon)\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Himax Technologies,\nInc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, the related consolidated\nstatements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the\nyears in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated April\n2, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment assessment of non-financial asset, excluding goodwill in the Wafer Level Optics cash\ngenerating unit\nAs discussed in Note 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the balance of other intangible\nassets and property, plant and equipment were $816 thousand and $130,109 thousand, respectively as of\nDecember 31, 2023, a portion of which related to the Wafer Level Optics cash generating unit (“CGU”).\nThe Company’s non-financial assets excluding goodwill are reviewed at the reporting date to determine\nwhether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, impairment assessment will\nbe performed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the\nhigher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The value in use is determined by\ndiscounting the estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\nWe identified the impairment assessment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill in the Wafer Level\nOptics CGU as a critical audit matter because of the high degree of subjective auditor’s judgment required\nin evaluating the forecasted future revenues and discount rate assumptions and minor changes to those\nassumptions could have a significant effect on the Company’s impairment assessment of non-financial\nassets in the Wafer Level Optics CGU. In addition, the evaluation of the discount rate involved specialized\nskills and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We\ntested certain internal controls over the Company’s impairment assessment process of non-financial assets\nexcluding goodwill, including controls related to the determination of forecasted future revenues and the\nassumptions used to develop the discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted future revenues\nby comparing available subsequent purchase orders and industry revenue forecast. We compared the\nCompany’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately\nforecast future revenues. We performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted future revenues and\ndiscount rate to assess their impact on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In addition, we involved\nvaluation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s\ndiscount rate, by comparing it against an estimated discount rates developed independently based on\nmarket data and inputs.\n/s/ KPMG\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nApril 2, 2024\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nPrincipal Activities\nThe Company is a leading global fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display\nimaging processing technologies. The Company’s display driver ICs and timing controllers\nhave been adopted at scale across multiple industries worldwide including TVs, PC monitors,\nlaptops, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, ePaper devices, industrial displays, among others.\nAs the global market share leader in automotive display technology, the Company offers\ninnovative and comprehensive automotive IC solutions, including traditional driver ICs,\nadvanced in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI), local dimming timing\ncontrollers (Local Dimming TCON), Large Touch and Display Driver Integration (LTDI) and\nAMOLED display technologies. The Company is also a pioneer in tinyML visual-AI and\noptical technology related fields. The Company’s industry-leading WiseEyeTM Smart Sensing\ntechnology which incorporates Himax proprietary ultralow power AI processor, always-on\nCMOS image sensor, and CNN-based AI algorithm has been widely deployed in consumer\nelectronics and AIoT related applications. While the Company optics technologies, such as\ndiffractive wafer level optics, LCoS micro-displays and 3D sensing solutions, are critical for\nfacilitating emerging AR/VR/metaverse technologies. Besides, Himax designs and provides\ntouch controllers, AMOLED ICs, LED drivers, EPD drivers, power management ICs, and\nCMOS image sensors for diverse display application coverage.\n(c) Foreign Currency\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (USD). The functional\ncurrency for the Company and its major operating subsidiaries is the USD. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the USD are\nincluded in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting\ncurrency (the USD) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. Equity\naccounts are translated at historical rates. The statements of profit or loss and cash flows are\ntranslated at the average exchange rates at the date of transaction. Translation gains or losses\nare accumulated as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome.\n(d) Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash,\nsold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are\nobligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one\nyear from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as\ncurrent are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash comprise cash balances and demand deposits. Cash equivalents comprise short-term\nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are\nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. Deposits with an original\nmaturity of three months or less at the time of purchase but not for investments and other\npurposes and are qualified with the aforementioned criteria are classified as cash equivalent.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(f) Financial Instruments\nThe Company shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of\nfinancial position when, and only when, the Company becomes party to the contractual\nprovisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be\nrecognized and derecognized, as applicable, using trade date accounting.\n1. Financial Assets\n(i) Classification of financial assets\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the\nfinancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets\nare classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, measured\nat fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is\ngenerally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its\ncontractual cash flow characteristics. When, and only when, the Company changes\nits business model for managing financial assets it shall reclassify all affected\nfinancial assets.\ni. Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following\nconditions and is not designated as measured at fair value through profit or\nloss:\n(i) the asset held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets\nto collect contractual cash flows; and\n(ii) the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is\nreduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and\nlosses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on\nderecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nii. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI)\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the\nCompany may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the\ninvestment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-\ninvestment basis.\nEquity investments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value.\nDividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly\nrepresents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and\nlosses are recognized in OCI. When an investment is derecognized, the\ncumulative gain or loss in equity will not be reclassified to profit or loss,\ninstead, is reclassified to retained earnings.\niii. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss.\nSuch financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, and attributable\ntransaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to\ninitial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial\nassets measured at amortized cost (including accounts receivable).\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to\nlifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and contract\nassets, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount\nequal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial\ninstrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss\nallowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from\nall possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and\nsupportable information that is relevant. This includes both qualitative and\nquantitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical\nexperience and credit assessment as well as forward-looking information.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all\nfinancial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount\nthrough a loss allowance account.\n(iii) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset\nand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to\nanother entity.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and\nreceivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an\ninvestment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had\nbeen recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained\nearnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n2. Financial Liabilities\n(i) Classification of financial liability\nThe Company classify all financial liabilities as measured at amortized cost, except\nfor financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities,\nincluding derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair\nvalue.\n(ii) Derecognition of financial liability\nThe Company removes a financial liability from its statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, it is extinguished-when the obligation specified in the\ncontract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability at amortized cost in its entirety, the\ndifference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or\ntransferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash\nassets transferred or liabilities assumed, shall be recognized in profit or loss.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(g) Inventories\nInventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods awaiting\nfinal assembly and test and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ndetermined using the weighted-average method. For work-in-process and manufactured\ninventories, cost consists of the cost of raw materials (primarily fabricated wafer and\nprocessed tape), direct labor and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net\nrealizable value for raw materials is based on replacement cost. Net realizable value for\nfinished goods and work in process is calculated based on the estimated selling price less all\nestimated costs of completion and necessary selling costs.\n(h) Equity Method Investments\nEquity investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over the operating and financial policy decisions of the investee but does not have\na controlling financial interest in the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. The\nCompany’s share of the net income or net loss of an investee is recognized in earnings from\nthe date the significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.\nThe difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net\nassets of an investee at investment date is allocated to related assets which are amortized over\ntheir useful lives. Any unallocated difference is treated as investor-level goodwill and is not\namortized.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company\nceases to have significant influence over an associate, and then measures the retained interests\nat fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the\ndate the equity method was discontinued and the fair value of the retained interests along with\nany proceeds from disposing of a part of the interest in the associate is recognized in profit or\nloss. When the Company discontinues the use of the equity method, the Company shall\naccount for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to\nthat investment on the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, if there is any indication of impairment, the entire\ncarrying amount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment as a single\nasset, by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. An impairment loss\nrecognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment in associates. Accordingly,\nany reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount\nof the investment subsequently increases.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(i) Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of land, building and machinery and\nequipment used in the design and development of products, and is stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation on building\nand machinery and equipment commences when the asset is ready for its intended use. Except\nfor the following paragraph, depreciation is primarily calculated on the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives of related assets which range as follows: building 25 years,\nbuilding improvements 4 to 16 years, machinery 4 to 10 years, research and development\nequipment 2 to 6 years, office furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years, others 2 to 10 years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease\nterm or the estimated useful life of the asset. Embedded software is amortized on a straight-\nline basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,\nthen they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and\nequipment.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date\nand adjusted if appropriate.\nProperty, plant and equipment that are highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale\nrather than through continuing use, are reclassified as held for sale. Immediately before\nclassification as held for sale, the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount\nand fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on assets initially classified as held for\nsale and any subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognized in profit or loss.\nGains are not recognized in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognized.\nOnce classified as held for sale, the property, plant and equipment are no longer depreciated.\n(j) Leases\na. Identifying a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset, and the supplier does not have a\nsubstantive right to substitute the asset; and\n(ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from\nuse of the identified asset throughout the period of use; and\n(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the\nperiod of use.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nb. As a lessee\nPayments for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases are recognized as expenses\non a straight-line basis during the lease term for which the recognition exemption is\napplied. Except for leases described above, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability shall\nbe recognized for all other leases at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease\ncommencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the\nlease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company\ndetermines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various\nexternal financing sources. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which\ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made\nat or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial\ndirect costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring the underlying\nasset.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nshorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term. The lease liability is\nsubsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured (i) if there is a change in the lease term; (ii) if there is a change in future lease\npayments arising from a change in an index or a rate; (iii) if there is a change in the\namounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or (iv) if the Company\nchanges its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination\noption. When the lease liability is remeasured in the circumstances aforementioned, a\ncorresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\nHowever, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero, any\nremaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n(i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments.\n(ii) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise and lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is\nreasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\nMoreover, the lease liability is remeasured when lease modifications occur that decrease\nthe scope of the lease. The Company accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability\nby decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full\ntermination of the lease and recognizes in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the\npartial or full termination of the lease.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nc. As a lessor\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an\noperating lease are added to the carrying amount of the asset leased.\n(k) Goodwill\nGoodwill is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net\nassets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated\nimpairment losses, if any.\nGoodwill from acquisition of Himax Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly Wisepal Technologies,\nInc., merged into Himax Technologies Limited on July 2, 2018) in 2007 amounting $26,846\nthousand has been assigned to Driver IC cash generating unit (“CGU”) and goodwill from\nacquisition of Himax Display (USA) Inc. in 2012 amounting $1,292 thousand has been\nassigned to WLO CGU because these CGUs are expected to benefit from the synergies of the\nbusiness combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU\nthat are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount\nof a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets\nof the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment\nloss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for\ngoodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In\nassessing value in use which was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial\nbudgets covering the future five-year period with the terminal growth rate. The annual\ndiscount rate was 11.98% and 9.95% in its test of Goodwill impairment for Driver IC CGU\nas of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, based on industry weighted average cost of\ncapital. The annual discount rate for WLO CGU was 15.38% and 13.96% as of December 31,\n2022 and 2023, respectively. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average\nTaiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.18% and\n2.6% used in the test for both CGUs as of December 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The\nkey assumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the\nrelated industry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(l) Other Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets include patents, intellectual property and developed technology\nacquired in a business combination. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over the following estimated useful lives: software 2-10 years, patents 12-15 years,\nintellectual property 10 years and technology 7 years.\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date\nand adjusted if appropriate.\n(m) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company’s long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets, are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there\nis any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable\namount is estimated.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Considering the\nterminal growth rate if non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life are allocated to the\nCGU in comparison with its carrying amount.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that\nare largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-\ngenerating unit, or CGU”).\nThe annual discount rate was 11.40% in its test of non-financial assets impairment with an\nindefinite useful life for CMOS CGU as of December 31, 2021, based on industry weighted\naverage cost of capital. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average Taiwan\neconomic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.46% used in the test\nas of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions abovementioned represents the\nmanagement’s forecast of the future for the related industry by considering the history\ninformation from internal and external sources.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. When an\nimpairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU is increased\nto the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not\nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nIFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with\ncustomers, using a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount\nof revenue recognized. The Company generates revenue primarily from sale of goods or\nservices. Revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by primarily geographical\nmarket and major products.\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company identifies the contract with the customers and recognizes\nrevenue when performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled in\nthe transfer of goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it\nsatisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a\ncustomer. Customers obtain control of the product when the goods are delivered and accepted\nby customers. Invoices are generated at that point in time.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition from product sales is measured at the amount that is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized\nwill not occur. Revenue is reduced for estimated rebates and other similar allowances.\nTrade receivable is recognized when the Company is entitled for unconditional right to\nreceive payment upon delivery of goods to customers. The consideration received in advance\nfrom the customer but without delivery of goods is recognized as a contract liability, for which\nrevenue is recognized when the control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\nThe Company expects that the length of time when the Company transfers the goods or\nservices to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be less\nthan one year. Therefore, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the time value of\nmoney.\n(o) Employee Benefits\n1. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed unless another policy allows or requires it to\nbe capitalized. Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are\nmeasured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for\nservice rendered by employees.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n2. Share-based payment arrangements\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for share-based compensation is\nmeasured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments issued. The\ncost of employee services is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to\nemployees and is recognized in earnings with a corresponding increase in equity over the\nservice period by graded vesting. Compensation cost also considers the number of\nawards management believes will eventually vest. As a result, compensation cost is\nreduced by the estimated forfeitures. The estimate is adjusted each period to reflect the\ncurrent estimate of forfeitures, and finally, the actual number of awards that vest.\n3. Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nemployee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are\nrendered by employees.\n4. Defined benefit plans\nThe Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated\nseparately for each benefit plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the\nfair value of any plan assets. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of\nproviding benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit costs\n(including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit\nretirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service\ncost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability\n(asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in profit or loss in the period they\noccur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan\nassets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is\nreflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n(p) Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in profit or loss\nexcept to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in\nequity or in other comprehensive income.\nThe Company has adopted International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments\nto IAS 12) upon their release on May 23, 2023. The amendments provide a temporary\nmandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective\nimmediately, and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nThe mandatory exception applies retrospectively. However, because no new legislation to\nimplement the top-up tax was enacted or substantially enacted on December 31, 2022 in any\njurisdiction in which the Company operates and no related deferred tax was recognized at that\ndate, the retrospective application has no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe Company has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the\nimpacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax when it is incurred. South Korea\nand Japan are the only two countries which represent jurisdictions where the Company\nmaintains subsidiaries' operations and have already enacted tax legislation on December 31,\n2023. The Company has evaluated the current tax impact to be immaterial for the year ended\n31 December 2023.\n1. Current tax\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or\nlosses for the year and any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous\nyears. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted tax rate at the\nreporting date.\n2. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities\nin the financial statements and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit\ncarry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities\nof a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment\ndate. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent\nthat it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions\nare reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n(q) Business Combinations\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-\nrelated costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as\nthe excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in\nthe acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired\nand the liabilities assumed. Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-\ncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net\nassets.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nAny contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the\ncontingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is\naccounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration are recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and the resulting\ngain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n(r) Earnings Per Ordinary Share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is computed using profit or loss attributable to the\nshareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of\nordinary and diluted ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary\nequivalent shares are ordinary shares that are contingently issuable upon the vesting of\nunvested restricted share units (RSUs) and employee stock options granted to employees.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nProfits attributable to Himax Technologies, Inc.\nstockholders (in thousands) $ 436,896 236,982 50,616\nDenominator for basic earnings per ordinary\nshare:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding (in thousands) 349,228 349,448 348,990\nBasic earnings per ordinary share attributable to\nHimax Technologies, Inc. stockholders $ 1.25 0.68 0.15\nBasic earnings per ADS attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders(1) $ 2.50 1.36 0.29\nContingently issuable ordinary shares underlying the unvested RSUs and employee stock\noptions granted to employees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary\nshare based on treasury stock method.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The number of ADS\nequivalent outstanding is determined by dividing the number of ordinary shares by\ntwo. Therefore, the weighted average number of ADS equivalent outstanding used\nin basic earnings per ADS for 2021, 2022 and 2023 is 174,614 thousand, 174,724\nthousand and 174,495 thousand, respectively. Additionally, the weighted average\nnumber of ADS equivalent outstanding used in diluted earnings per ADS for 2021,\n2022 and 2023 is 174,867 thousand, 174,817 thousand and 174,783 thousand,\nrespectively. The earnings per ADS is presented solely for the convenience of the\nreader and does not represent a measure under IFRS.\n(s) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses. All operating segments’ operating results are\nreviewed regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for\nwhich discrete financial information is available.\nThe Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who regularly\nreviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing\nperformance for the Company. Management has determined that the Company has two\noperating segments: Driver IC and Non-driver products.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on segment sales and\nsegment profit and loss. There are no intersegment sales in the segment revenues reported to\nthe CODM. Segment profit and loss is determined on a basis that is consistent with how the\nCompany reports operating income (loss) in its consolidated statements of operations.\nSegment profit (loss) excludes income taxes and items in non-operating income (loss).\nThe Company does not report segment asset information to the Company’s CODM.\nConsequently, no asset information by segment is presented.\n(t) Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are classified in the consolidated statements of profit or loss as part\nof profit (loss) for the period and the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part\nof equity in the consolidated statements of financial position. If a change in ownership of a\nconsolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership\ninterests are re-measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings.\n(u) Use of Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in\nany future periods affected.\nInformation about critical judgments, estimates and assumptions in applying accounting\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements is included in the following notes:\n1. Valuation of inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses\njudgment and estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of\neach reporting period.\nDue to the rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value\nof inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and\nthen writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value\nof the inventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a\nspecific time horizon.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n2. Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of non-financial assets other than\ngoodwill, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\nindependent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the\nspecific asset groups. Any changes in these estimates based on changed economic\nconditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or\nreversal in future years.\n3. Recognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized.\nAssessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires the Company’s subjective\njudgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, the sources\nof taxable income, the amount of tax credits that can be utilized and feasible tax planning\nstrategies. Changes in the economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws\nand regulations may result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n4. Impairment of goodwill\nThe assessment of impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make subjective\njudgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and\nestimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating the\nrecoverable amount of relevant CGU, the Company is required to make subjective\njudgments in determining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent\ncash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nNote 5. Consolidation\nThe Company holds 49% of the outstanding voting shares of Viewsil. One board director appointed\nby the one other shareholder resigned on December 30, 2023, and that other shareholder informed\nthe Company that it would not appoint another board of director to fill the casual vacancy in the\nfuture. Therefore, there would be 3 board directors in Viewsil and the Company would assign 2\nboard seats with obtaining more than half of the total number of Viewsil’s directors from December\n30, 2023 without consideration paid. An investor has power over an investee when the investor\nhas existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities that significantly\naffect the investee returns.(cid:0)(cid:3) The Company has the power to determine the major matters and the\nmost important decisions that will significantly impact the operations and direct financial interests\nare resolved by majority vote of directors present in the meeting. Therefore, it is determined that\nthe Company has controlling power over Viewsil from December 30, 2023, the acquisition date.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The re-measurement loss on the previously held equity interests in Viewsil was $1,932\nthousand which is included in “other gains (losses)” in the consolidated statements of profit or loss.\nThe results of Viewsil’s operations for 2023 have not been included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements since the acquisition date on December 30, 2023. If the consolidation had\noccurred on January 1, 2023, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been\n$945,428 thousand (unaudited), and consolidated profit for the year would have been $50,641\nthousand (unaudited). In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value\nadjustments that arose on the date of consolidation would have been the same if the consolidation\nhad occurred on January 1, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of estimated fair value of the assets obtained and\nliabilities assumed at the date of consolidation.\nFair value\n(in thousands)\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets obtained and liabilities\nassumed:\nCash $ 433\nCurrent assets, other than cash 2,576\nOther assets 7\nOther current liabilities (1,425)\nTotal identifiable net assets obtained 1,591\nNoncontrolling interests (811)\n$ 780\nObtained assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values based on management’s\nestimate.\nNote 6.

Sensitivity analysis\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises from the translation of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, other receivable, accounts payable, other payable and lease liabilities that are\ndenominated in foreign currency.\nDepreciation or appreciation of the USD by 10% against the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD),\nCNY and JPY at December 31, 2022 and 2023, while all other variables were remained\nconstant, would have increased or (decreased) the net profit before tax of $7,801\nthousand and $3,052 thousand, respectively.\niii. Interest rate risk\nThe Company’s short-term secured borrowings and long-term unsecured borrowings\ncarried floating interest rates and fixed interest rates. The Company’s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates is mainly from floating-rate borrowings. Any change in interest\nrates will cause the effective interest rates of borrowings to change and thus cause the\nfuture cash flows to fluctuate over time.\nThe following sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to interest rate\nrisk. For floating-rate debts, the analysis assumes that the balances of outstanding debts\nat the end of the reporting period had been outstanding for the entire year.\nFor the Company’s floating-rate debts, assuming all other variables were remained\nconstant, an increase or a decrease in the interest rate by 0.25% would have resulted in a\ndecrease or an increase in the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31,\n2022 and 2023 by $116 thousand and $101 thousand, respectively.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Financial Risk Management\n(a) Overview\nThe Company is exposed to the following risks due to usage of financial instruments:\n(1) Credit risk\n(2) Liquidity risk\n(3) Market risk\nHereinafter discloses information about the Company’s exposure to variable risks, and the\ngoals, policies and procedures of the Company’s risk measurement and risk management.\n(b) Risk management framework\nManagement of related divisions are appointed to review, control, trace and monitor the\nstrategic risks, financial risks and operational risks faced by the Company. Management\nreports to executive officers the progress of risk controls from time to time and, if necessary,\nreport to the board of directors, depending on the extent of impact of risks.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a\nfinancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposures to\ncredit risk are primarily from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost and\naccounts receivable.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\nThe Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with various reputable financial\ninstitutions. Financial assets at amortized cost are time deposits with original maturities of\ngreater than three months. The Company has not experienced any material losses on deposits\nof the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at amortized cost.\nManagement performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial\ninstitutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Management\nbelieves that there is a limited concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalent and\nfinancial assets at amortized cost.\nThe Company derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of display drivers that are\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions and subject to price fluctuations. Management\ncontinuously evaluates and controls the credit quality, credit limit and financial strength of its\ncustomers to ensure any overdue receivables are taken necessary procedures.\nThe Company depends on two customers for majority of its revenues. The Company’s sales\nto these two customers as a percentage of revenues are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2022 2023\nCustomer A and its affiliates 32.1% 32.3% 28.7%\nCustomer C 19.1% 9.4% 11.0%\nThe percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable accounted by customers, those\nrepresenting more than 10% of total accounts receivable balance, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2022 2023\nCustomer A and its affiliates 31.5% 28.5%\nCustomer C 10.3% 10.3%\nRefer to Note 11 for aging analysis of accounts receivable and the movement in the loss\nallowance.\nIn addition, the Company has at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of its\ncustomers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment terms, and the\nCompany may grant such requests for extension in the future. As a result, a default by any\nsuch customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable, or the extension of\npayment terms for the Company’s customers could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow,\nliquidity and operating results. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of each\ncustomer and adjusts credit policy based upon payment history and the customer’s credit\nworthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023\n!\n(d) Liquidity risk\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity\nto fund its business requirements associated with existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThe Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate working capital and unused\ncredit facilities.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s working capital together with existing unused credit\nfacilities under its existing loan agreements will be sufficient to fulfill all of its contractual\nobligations. Therefore, management believes that there is no liquidity risk resulting from\nincapable of financing to fulfill the contractual obligations.\n(e) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and\ninterest rates, will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial\ninstruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n(1) Currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on operating activities that are denominated\nin a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Company, the USD.\nThe currencies used in these transactions are the NTD, CNY and JPY.\n(2) Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its outstanding\nborrowings. The Company’s borrowings carried floating interest rates. To manage the\ninterest rate risk, the Company periodically assesses the interest rates of bank loans and\nmaintains good relationships with financial institutions to obtain lower financing costs.\nThe Company also strengthens the management of working capital to reduce the\ndependence on bank loans as well as the risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\nNote 25. Capital management\nThrough clear understanding and managing of significant changes in external environment, related\nindustry characteristics, and corporate growth plan, the Company manages its capital structure in\na manner to ensure it has sufficient financial resources to fund its working capital needs, capital\nexpenditures, research and development activities, dividend payments and other business\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed\ncapital managements.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Currently, management is not aware of any such claims that it believes could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\n(d) Since Himax Taiwan is not a listed company, it will depend on Himax Technologies, Inc. to\nmeet its equity financing requirements in the future. Any capital contribution by Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. to Himax Taiwan may require the approval of the relevant ROC authorities.\nThe Company may not be able to obtain any such approval in the future in a timely manner,\nor at all.

          "content": "Dear Shareholders,\nComing off our recording breaking performance in 2021, it was a year of navigating challenges for Himax\nin 2022. Unexpected Covid-19 related lockdowns in China, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic\nheadwinds presented unique obstacles that impaired our financial results. An abrupt halt in consumer\ndemand reduced visibility at panel houses and OEMs stymieing IC demand across the industry leading to\na rapid inventory build-up as wafer production typically begins months in advance. This ultimately\nimpacted both our top line and gross margin due to price erosion in certain products as part of the\noffloading cycle coupled with a high cost of goods that were sourced when foundry prices peaked. To\nmanage through this down cycle, we curtailed wafer starts while prioritizing customers specifically for\nthe purpose of digesting our excess inventory. Our aggressive inventory destocking measures yielded\nencouraging results with inventory levels expected to return to their historical averages prior to the end of\n2023.\nDespite the downturn this year, there were several highlights we are proud of. For starters, our automotive\nsegment continued exceptional business momentum to lead all product lines, increasing by over 50% to\nbuild on the impressive growth in 2021 when sales grew 110%. Additionally, several new sales streams\nhave started to produce more meaningful contributions, including ICs for AMOLED and ultralow power\nWiseEyeTM smart sensing. All of these product lines enjoy higher gross margin than corporate average.\nNow to briefly review the year for each of our major business segments.\nOur small and medium-sized display driver IC business experienced an annual decline, primarily a result\nof stubbornly high channel inventories amidst continued sluggish demand, especially in consumer\nelectronic products, specifically smartphone and tablet. This was partially offset by the extraordinary\ngrowth in our automotive business, and which is now our biggest revenue contributor. Our position as the\nmarket share leader in both DDIC and TDDI for automotive remains unchallenged. Secular trends for\nvehicle display remain quite favorable for us in terms of increases in size, quantity and sophistication,\nindicating substantial long term growth potential. Our automotive TDDI is poised to enjoy explosive\ngrowth backed by around 300 design-wins, most of which have not yet started mass production.\nAdditionally, we continue to provide a one-stop-shop offering of the most comprehensive automotive\nproduct portfolio in the market while looking to expand further in many upcoming leading edge new\nautomotive technologies, such as LTDI and local dimming Tcon, among others.\nAmong our three major DDIC product categories, large-sized display drivers posted the sharpest decline\nin 2022, a result of slowing end market sell-through where customers across the board, from brands to\npanel houses, imposed stringent inventory control measures. Nonetheless, we continue to stay focused on\npositioning our product lineups towards high frame rate and high-resolution technologies, fulfilling end\ncustomers’ pursuit of visual enjoyment. We also look to increase market penetration with our integrated\nsolution of high-end Tcon and drivers in 4K/8K TV, gaming monitor and low power notebook markets.\nTurning to OLED, we believe AMOLED driver will be a major growth driver for us in the coming years\nas OLED displays gather momentum in a wide range of applications. In 2022, we commenced\nproduction of AMOLED DDIC and Tcon for automotive and tablet displays catering to leading\ncustomers. We also formed strategic partnerships with major Korean and Chinese panels makers for\nAMOLED driver IC developments for various applications, such as smartphone, TV and notebook.\n1\nFurthermore, we are making good progress in AMOLED development for smartphone, have secured\nmeaningful capacity and expect to commence production toward the end of 2023.\nOur non-driver IC business also experienced a decline in 2022, primarily from lower shipments of large\nsized display Tcon, offset by the increase of a new WiseEye sales stream. For WiseEye, we continued to\nsupport Dell’s new laptops production using our first generation WE1 solution while also gaining more\ntraction in various endpoint AI application markets. We are receiving increased recognition from a host\nof leading laptop vendors and CPU platform players showing strong interest in broadening AI use cases\nfor future generation smart notebooks by adopting our next generation WE2 AI processor. Backed by a\nstrong business pipeline and robust design-in activities in numerous AIoT applications with customers\nfrom all over the world, we expect strong sales momentum for WiseEye in 2023.\nFinally, for our optical related businesses, WLO, LCoS and 3D sensing. Himax is one of the few\ncompanies in the technology industry with deep experience in a wide array of optical related product lines.\nWe continue to receive inquiries including a fast-expanding list of AR/VR goggle devices along with\nincreasing engineering projects from leading global names. For our WLO technology, we are set to\ncommence volume production enabling controller-free 3D gesture control to one leading North American\ncustomer for their next generation VR devices starting in 2023. With years of research and development\nin LCoS, we continue to drive innovation unveiling our Color Sequential Front-lit LCoS technology,\nwhich features an unrivaled lightweight and compact form factor making it the perfect microdisplay\nsolution to meet the stringent specifications for next generation AR glasses. We look forward to continuing\nour role as a facilitator in the development of immersive technologies towards the next generation of\nAR/VR and metaverse related devices.\nLooking ahead to 2023 and beyond, we remain committed to strategically expanding in high value-added\nareas where we expect secular trends of growth to remain intact, including TDDI and Tcon for automotive,\nOLED and AI. Some of these areas we have already established ourselves as the market leader.\nFurthermore, we aim to stay on the cutting edge, investing in innovative technologies that bolster our\nmarket leadership, as well as broaden and diversify our market reach towards the goal of generating\nsustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.\nThank you for your interest and support for Himax. We are grateful for our shareholders, customers,\npartners, and employees, and look forward with confidence to having a great year in 2023.\nSincerely,\nJordan Wu\nPresident and CEO\nHimax Technologies, Inc.\n2\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 20-F\n(Mark One)\nREGISTRATION STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(b) OR (g) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nOR\nANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\nOR\nTRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nOR\nSHELL COMPANY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nDate of event requiring this shell company report ________________\nFor the transition period from ________________ to ________________\nCommission file number: 000-51847\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)\nNot Applicable\n(Translation of Registrant’s name into English)\nCAYMAN ISLANDS\n(Jurisdiction of incorporation or organization)\nNO. 26, ZIH LIAN ROAD\nSINSHIH DISTRICT, TAINAN CITY 74148\nTAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n(Address of principal executive offices)\nJessica Pan\nChief Financial Officer\nTelephone: +886-6-505-0880\nE-mail: jessica_pan@himax.com.tw\nFacsimile: +886-6-507-0038\nNo. 15, Zih Lian Road\nSinshih District, Tainan City 74148\nTaiwan, Republic of China\n(Name, Telephone, E-mail and/or Facsimile number and Address of Company Contact Person)\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act:\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol Name of each exchange on which\nregistered\nOrdinary Shares, par value $0.3 per HIMX The NASDAQ Global Select\nordinary share Market Inc.*\n3\n* Not for trading, but only in connection with the listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, Inc. of\nAmerican Depositary Shares representing such Ordinary Shares.\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act: None\nSecurities for which there is a reporting obligation pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Act: None\nIndicate the number of outstanding shares of each of the issuer’s classes of capital or common stock as of the close of the period\ncovered by the annual report. 348,833,050 Ordinary Shares.\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act.\nYes No\nIf this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file reports pursuant to\nSection 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

IDENTITY OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISERS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 2. OFFER STATISTICS AND EXPECTED TIMETABLE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 3. KEY INFORMATION\n3.A. [Reserved]\n3.B. Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\n3.C. Reason for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n3.D. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation, which could result\nin an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.\nThere may be industry consolidation among our suppliers. Merger and acquisition activities will likely increase\nthe size and market power of the relevant suppliers and reduce the number of suppliers we could use under a simpler\nsupplier chain. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer contract terms,\nhigher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could result in an\nincrease in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. If we are unable to transfer any increase in average unit\ncost to our customers, our gross margin and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical\nand subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business\nor results of operations.\nIn 2021 and 2022, 88.0% and 86.8% of our revenues, respectively, were attributable to display drivers that were\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. We expect to continue to substantially depend on sales to the TFT-LCD panel\nindustry for the foreseeable future. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive and is vulnerable to\ncyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD panels generally decline with time as a result of,\namong other factors, drop in demand for end products that incorporate TFT LCD panels, new capacity ramp-up or\nfactory utilization improvement, technological advancements and cost reduction with the exception of the new high\nend and high-resolution products.\nThe merger of certain of our major customers could result in an increase in their bargaining power and therefore\nsubject us to additional downward pricing pressure. We cannot assure you that in such periods in which we\nexperience significant downward pricing pressure, we could sufficiently reduce costs to completely offset the loss of\nrevenues. In addition, a severe and prolonged industry downturn could also result in higher risks to the collectability\nof our accounts receivable, the marketability and valuation of inventories, the impairment of our long-term\nnon-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and the stability of our\nsupply chain. As a result, the cyclicality of the TFT-LCD panel industry could adversely affect our revenues, cost of\nrevenues and results of operations.\n10\nOur strategy of expanding our product offerings to non-driver products may not be successful.\nWe have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, financial and management resources to non-driver products’\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing to further diversify our product portfolio and improve gross margin as\nnon-driver products may have higher gross margin than our driver products. Our non-driver technologies cover\nLCoS microdisplay, CMOS image sensor, wafer level optics (“WLO”), 3D sensing and ultralow power WiseEye\nsmart image sensing, etc.\nFor our LCoS technology, at present our main focus areas for LCoS business are AR goggle devices, projectors\nand head-up-displays (HUD) for automotive. For CMOS image sensor business, in addition to the current shipment\nfor notebook and webcam applications, we also extend the sensor business for the broad AI market. Our AoS CMOS\nimage sensor is designed with proprietary architectures, readout, pixel, where the corresponding algorithms are\nintegrated to contribute the always-on feature that consumes only several micro watts to enable people detection,\neyeball tracking and many other features. On 3D sensing business, we focus on Structured Light and ToF 3D\nmodule solution and 3D decoder ASIC key component, aiming at emerging markets such as facial recognition-based\ne-payment, business access control, biomedical inspection device, eye-tracking and gesture control applications. For\nour ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing business, we focus on providing leading end-point AI solutions, in\nboth total solution and discrete key component, to meet diversified customer and application needs. Himax’s\nultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing solution integrates in-house AoS sensor, ultralow power AI processor\nand CNN-based AI algorithm from in house or third-party algorithm partners. Our WiseEye AI total solution had\nalready been adopted by one global leading notebook vendor and went into mass production from early 2022. We\nalso see growing adoption of our WiseEye technology in a broad range of applications, covering , shared bike\nparking, automotive, door lock, battery-powered surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing, and medical\ncapsule endoscope among others. Some of them already commenced production since 2022. As we focus on scaling\nadoption in this relatively untapped market, we also collaborate closely with numerous AI ecosystem partners and\ncommunities to make our AI solution more diverse and accessible. Progress has been made in areas such as smart\ncity / home / office, healthcare, smart agriculture and smart retail. Himax is more committed than ever to\nstrengthening the Company’s WiseEye product roadmap and retaining the leadership position in ultralow power AI\nprocessor and image sensor for end-point AI applications.\nDeveloping and commercializing each of our non-driver products requires a significant amount of management,\nengineering and monetary resources. For example, we have established certain in-house facilities for key\nmanufacturing processes of our non-driver products including LCoS microdisplay, WLO and 3D sensing. Numerous\nuncertainties exist in developing new products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our\nnon-driver products successfully. We may underestimate the amount of capital, personnel and other resources\nrequired to develop and commercialize our non-driver products. We may also overestimate the market potential of\nthe end products that are utilizing or will utilize our non-driver products. The failure or delay in the development,\nproduction or commercialization of any of our non-driver products, the occurrence of any product defects or design\nflaws, or the low market acceptance of or demand for either of our products or the end devices using our products\nmay adversely affect the impairment of our long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets, for non-driver products, our results of operations and growth prospects. The lower\ncapacity utilization rate of our factories will negatively affect our gross margin and our results of operations.\nMoreover, we will be subject to higher ramp-up expenses in the early stage of mass production of our non-driver\nproducts.\nThe concentration of our revenues and accounts receivable and the extension of payment terms for certain of\nour customers exposes us to increased credit risk and could harm our operating results and cash flows.\nIn 2022, Customer A and its affiliates accounted for 32.3% of our revenues. Our two largest customers together\naccounted for over 40% of our revenues in 2022. See “Item 5.A. Operating Results—Description of Certain\nStatements of Profit or Loss Line Items—Revenues” for our revenues description. Our results of operations and\nfinancial condition would be significantly linked to the success and purchase policy of any such customer. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, our accounts receivable from Customer A and its affiliates were $82.1 million, which\nrepresented approximately 31.5% of our accounts receivable, net. The concentration of our accounts receivable\nexposes us to increased credit risk. Moreover, we have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of\nour customers. As a result, any loss of or a sharp reduction in any such customer’s sales, a default by any such\ncustomer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable or the extension of payment terms for our\ncustomers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and operating results.\n11\nOur customers may experience a decline in profitability or may not be profitable at all, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTFT-LCD panel manufacturers, including our customers, experience significant pressure on prices and profit\nmargins, due largely to growing industry capacity and fluctuations in demand for TFT-LCD panels. Some panel\nmanufacturers have greater access to capital or greater production, research and development, intellectual property,\nmarketing or other resources than our customers, who may not be able to compete and sustain their market positions.\nFurther, our customers’ business performance may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which\nare beyond their control, including and not limited to: (1) consumer demand and the general economic conditions,\nsuch as recent geopolitical tensions relating to invasion of Ukraine by Russia and China city lockdowns due to\nCovid mandates; (2) the cyclical nature of the TFT-LCD industry in average selling price fluctuations, as well as its\ndownstream industries; (3) the speed at which TFT-LCD panel manufacturers expand production capacity; (4) brand\ncompanies’ continued needs for original equipment manufacturing services provided by TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers; (5) access to raw materials, components, equipment and utilities on a timely and economical basis;\n(6) technological changes; (7) the rescheduling and cancellation of large orders; (8) access to funding on satisfactory\nterms; and (9) fluctuations in the currencies of TFT-LCD panels exporting countries against the U.S. dollar.\nWe depend on sales of display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, and the limited potential for further growth in\nboth the market size of display drivers and the market share of our display drivers or the absence of continued\nmarket acceptance of our display drivers could limit our growth in revenues or harm our business.\nIn 2021 and 2022, 88.0% and 86.8% of our revenues, respectively, were from the sale of display drivers used\nfor large, small and medium-sized applications, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our\nrevenues from these or related products. As the display driver industry is relatively mature, there may be limited\npotential for the overall display drivers market to grow and for us to further grow our market share and revenues.\nFailure to grow our unit shipments for display drivers, coupled with a general decline in the average selling\nprices, could adversely and materially affect our results of operations. See also “—Risks Relating to Our\nIndustry—The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our\nrevenues and operating results”. Therefore, the continued market acceptance of our display drivers is critical to our\nfuture success. Failure to grow or maintain our revenues generated from the sales of display drivers could adversely\nand materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to public health epidemics, including the recent novel coronavirus outbreaks.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic interferes\nwith our ability, or that of our employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners to perform our and their\nrespective responsibilities and obligations related to the conduct of our business. Since November 2019, a novel strain\nof coronavirus (Covid-19) has spread across the world. The outbreak of Covid-19 has caused significant disruption not\nonly to the financial markets but also to global supply chains, which can substantially depress global business\nactivities, restrict access to capital and result in a long-term economic downturn that would negatively affect our\noperating results.\nAs a result of the pandemic, numerous unprecedented measures are in place to try to contain the virus, such as\ntravel restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures may\nfurther impact our workforce and operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers. The ultimate impact\nand efficacy of measures and potential future measures is currently unknown. We have experienced and will\nexperience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other restrictions on\nthe ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to develop and design our products in a\ntimely manner. Our suppliers, sub-contractors and customers have been and will be disrupted by quarantines and\nsocial distancing measures, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border\nclosures, or other travel-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our suppliers’\nmanufacturing, assembling, and testing operations, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be\ndelayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships.\n12\nExtra export licenses may be needed for certain product or technology for certain customers. These licenses\nare regulated by Export Administration Regulations (EAR) which are administered by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).\nOur business is subject to various international laws and legal requirements from the U.S. Export\nAdministration Regulations and other jurisdictions’ applicable executive orders in packaging, product content, labor\nand import/export regulations, etc. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with\nlimited notice, have generally become more rigorous and have intensified under the current U.S. administration,\nespecially in recent geopolitical tensions with China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply\nwith, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations\nor our customers are sanctioned, or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may be required to suspend sales to\nthese customers, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf our foundry, tape, assembly and testing suppliers fail to comply with these regulations or our suppliers are\nsanctioned or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may suspend their services and have to obtain alternative\nservices in a timely manner. Considering the amount of time, it usually takes to qualify assembly and testing houses,\nwe may experience significant delays in product shipments. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery,\nquality or cost of our products could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover,\nthe scarcity and importance of services may necessitate us making investments in foundry, tape, assembly and\ntesting service providers in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital\noutlays and possibly raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nTechnological innovation may reduce the number of display drivers typically required for each panel, thereby\nreducing the number of display drivers we are able to sell per panel. If such a reduction in demand is not offset\nby the general growth of the industry, our market share or average selling prices, or our revenues may decline.\nIn order to reduce costs, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers generally seek to have display drivers with higher\nchannel counts and new panel designs to reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel. We have\nbeen developing such innovative and cost-effective display driver solutions in order to grow our market share,\nattract additional customers, increase our average selling prices and capture new design wins. However, we cannot\nassure you that we will successfully achieve these goals. If we fail to do so and the number of display drivers\ntypically required per panel decreases thereby reducing our unit shipments, our revenues may decline. TFT-LCD\npanel manufacturers have developed several panel designs to reduce the usage of display drivers, including gate in\npanel, or GIP, amorphous silicon gate, or ASG, or simply gateless designs, which integrate the gate driver function\nonto the glass and eliminate the need for gate drivers, as well as dual gate and triple gate panel designs, which would\nlargely reduce the usage of source drivers. If such designs or technologies become widely adopted, demand for our\ndisplay drivers may decrease significantly, which would adversely and materially affect our results of operations.\nThe strategic relationships between certain of our competitors and their customers and the development of in-house\ncapabilities by TFT-LCD and AMOLED panel manufacturers may limit our ability to expand our customer base and\nour growth prospects.\nCertain of our competitors have established or may establish strategic or strong relationships with TFT-LCD\nand AMOLED panel manufacturers that are also our existing or potential customers. Marketing our display drivers\nto such TFT-LCD and AMOLED panel manufacturers that have established relationships with our competitors may\nbe difficult. Moreover, several TFT-LCD and AMOLED panel manufacturers have in-house design capabilities and\ntherefore may not need to source semiconductor products from us. If our customers successfully develop in-house\ncapabilities to design and develop semiconductors that can substitute for our products, they would likely reduce or\nstop purchasing our products. To sell new products, we will likely need to target new market segments and new\ncustomers with whom we do not have current relationships, which may require different strategies and may present\ndifficulties that we have not encountered before. Failure to broaden our customer base and attract new customers\nmay limit our growth prospects.\nAs AMOLED offers brighter color, near-perfect-black, less power consumption and is thinner and lighter than\nTFT-LCD, it gradually penetrates the mid to high-end TFT-LCD market, especially the smartphone market.\nAMOLED display and related DDICs have been dominated by Korean companies. The marketplace is increasing\nutilization of the AMOLED display for smartphone and other consumer electronics due to expanded AMOLED\ncapacity. We continue to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC development in partnership with major Chinese and\nKorean panel makers. For tablet, we are seeing shipments on the rise for premium models that adopt advanced\nAMOLED display, of which Himax offers both DDIC and Tcon and has commenced production to certain leading\nbrands. For automotive AMOLED display, we continue to win project awards for our flexible AMOLED driver and\n13\nTcon with both conventional car makers and EV/NEV vendors. Finally, we are making good progress with leading\npanel houses for the development of AMOLED display drivers for smartphone, TV and notebook applications.\nHowever, we could not assure you the success of our AMOLED driver IC as we are unable to penetrate into the\nmass volume existing Korean and China supplier chain and/or find new AMOLED panel manufactures to\ndesign-wins our solutions into. AMOLED process maturity for the new manufactures and the possible specification\nchange due to the immaturity of the AMOLED will also be a hurdle to our AMOLED share gain and success.\nHimax’s shipment for AMOLED driver ICs and TCON started from automotive application and then extended\nto tablet PC. There are multiple AMOLED projects under development jointly with worldwide leading panel makers\nfor other applications, including smart phones, TV, notebook PCs and many others. The growth momentum in\nAMOLED driver ICs and TCON is promising, but the risk of high dependency on limited customer base amid\ncurrent macro uncertainty might result in fluctuation in sales performance.\nWe depend primarily on third-party foundries to manufacture our wafers, and any failure to obtain sufficient\nfoundry capacity or loss of any of the foundries we use could significantly delay our ability to ship our products,\ncausing us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nAccess to foundry capacity is crucial to our business because we do not manufacture our own wafers, instead\nrelying primarily on third-party foundries. The ability of a foundry to manufacture our semiconductor products is\nlimited by its available capacity. Access to capacity is especially important due to the limited availability of the\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology required for the manufacture of wafers used in display drivers. If the\nprimary third-party foundries that we rely upon are not able to meet our required capacity, or if our business\nrelationships with these foundries are adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity to\nmeet increasing demand for our products. We may have to seek alternative foundries, which may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or which may expose us to qualifying-new-foundry risks, as further discussed\nbelow.\nWe use several foundries for different semiconductor products, and certain of our products are manufactured at\nonly one of these foundries. If any one of the foundries is unable to provide the required capacity to us, or does not\ndeliver in a timely manner, or the quality or pricing terms are not acceptable to us, or any of the foundries\nexperience financial difficulties or insolvency risks due to the impact of the global economic turmoil or any\ncompany-specific reasons or otherwise, if their operations are damaged or if there is any other disruption, directly or\nindirectly, of their foundry operations and we cannot qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner, we could\nexperience significant delays in receiving the product being manufactured by that foundry or incur additional costs\nto obtain substitutes, or interruption in our supply of the affected products. If we choose to use a new foundry or\nprocess technology for a particular semiconductor product, it will take us several quarters to qualify the new foundry\nor process before we can begin shipping. If we cannot qualify a new foundry in a timely manner, we may experience\nand incur damages as above mentioned and harm our customer relationships.\nAs a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of our wafers, we face several significant risks, including: (1)\nfailure to secure manufacturing capacity, or being able to obtain required capacity only at higher costs; (2) risks of\nour proprietary information leaking to our competitors through the foundries we use; (3) limited control of delivery\nschedules, quality assurance and control, manufacturing yields and wafer costs; (4) the unavailability of, or potential\ndelays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and (5) financial risks of certain of our foundry suppliers.\nTo manufacture our display drivers used in TFT-LCD and AMOLED panels, we require foundries with\nhigh-voltage CMOS manufacturing process capacity. As a result, our dependence on high-voltage CMOS foundries\npresents the following, additional risks: (1) potential capacity constraints faced by the limited number of\nhigh-voltage CMOS foundries and the lack of investment in new and existing high-voltage CMOS foundries; (2)\ndifficulty in attaining consistently high manufacturing yields from high-voltage CMOS foundries; (3) delay and time\nrequired to qualify and ramp up production at new high-voltage CMOS foundries; and (4) price increases.\nAs a result, we may be required to use foundries with which we have no established relationships, which could\nexpose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover, the\nscarcity of high-voltage foundry capacity may necessitate us making investments in foundries in order to secure\ncapacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional capital,\nwhich may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\n14\nSince 2020, due to the pandemic lockdown, the work-from-home and learn-from-home new lifestyles triggered\nincreasing demands for display and display drivers related products. The surging demand in display drivers caused\nthe severe foundry capacity shortage, while the industry has no major expansion plan especially on the mature nodes\nwe are primarily anchored to. To address the potential foundry capacity shortage worldwide, we had entered into\nstrategic agreements with our foundry partners in order to secure capacity to fulfill our business needs. Under these\nstrategic agreements, we are committed to purchasing a specific volume at fixed or variable prices. However, for\nboth pricing agreements, there can be no assurance that these prices provided in the strategic agreements with our\nfoundry partners will always remain competitive during the contract term. For example, in the event that the global\nsemiconductor market changes due to foundry capacity expansion and/or shrunken customer demand, the fixed\nprices we agree to pay our foundry partners may become significantly higher than the then prevailing market price.\nThe situation could materially adversely impact our pricing strategies, competitive position, profitability and results\nof operation. We may also be subject to contractual penalties if we are unable to purchase the committed volume\nfrom our foundry partners. In addition, since these strategic agreements with our foundry partners typically require\nus to make prepayments or refundable deposits to such foundry partners, our cash flow, liquidity and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to secure sufficient capacity from any of our third-party tape, assembly and testing houses at\nreasonable and competitive prices could disrupt our shipments, harm our customer relationships and reduce\nour sales.\nAccess to third-party tape, assembly and testing capacity is critical to our business because we do not have\nin-house tape, assembly and testing capabilities for commercial production and instead rely on third-party service\nproviders. Access to these services is especially important to our business because display drivers require\nspecialized tape, assembly and testing services. A limited number of third-party tape, assembly and testing houses\ntape, assemble and test substantially all of our current products. There has been an increased level of industry\nconsolidation among our suppliers in recent years. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for\nhigher prices, longer contract terms, higher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and\nproducts, which could result in an increase in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. We do not have binding\nlong-term supply arrangements with tape, assembly and testing service providers that guarantee us access to our\nrequired capacity. If the primary tape, assembly and testing service providers that we rely upon are not able to meet\nour requirements in price, quality, and service, or if our business relationships with these service providers were\nadversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity and would have to seek alternative\nproviders, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we do not directly\ncontrol our product delivery schedules, tape, assembly and testing costs, and quality assurance and control. If any of\nthese third-party tape, assembly and testing houses experiences capacity constraints, financial difficulties, suffers\nany damage to its facilities or if there is any disruption of its assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to\nobtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner. Because of the amount of time, we usually take\nto qualify assembly and testing houses, we may experience significant delays in product shipments if we are\nrequired to find alternative sources. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our\nproducts could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the scarcity and\nimportance of tape, assembly and testing services may necessitate us making investments in tape, assembly and\ntesting service providers in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital\noutlays and possibly raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of key components for our customers’ products could decrease demand for our products.\nShortages of components and other materials that are critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’\nproducts may limit our sales. These components and other materials include, but are not limited to, color filters,\nbacklight modules, polarizers, printed circuit boards and glass substrates. In the past, companies that use our\nproducts in their production have experienced delays in the availability of key components from other suppliers. In\naddition, component manufacturers may not be able to increase or maintain their component supply because of labor\nshortage in China or otherwise and may shut down certain of their capacity from time to time because of weak\ndemand, which may increase the instability of timely delivery and the risk of shortage of components. Such\nshortages of components and other materials critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’ products may\ncause a slowdown in demand for our products, resulting in a decrease in our sales and adversely affecting our results\nof operations. In addition, as a result of uncertain demand conditions, our customers may hesitate to build inventory\non hand and tend to release orders on short notice.\n15\nWe rely on the services of our key personnel, and if we are unable to retain our current key personnel and hire\nadditional personnel, our ability to design, develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\nWe rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key personnel, including\nJordan Wu, our president and chief executive officer, and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu, our chairman, and certain engineering,\ntechnical and senior management personnel, in particular, who are critical to our corporate management, business\noperation strategy, operation execution, future technological and product innovations. Competition for these\npersonnel is intense in the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. Moreover, our future success depends on the\nexpansion of our senior management team and the retention of key employees. Any of our key employees could\nleave our company with little or no prior notice in applicable jurisdictions and could then work with a competitor. In\naddition, we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any key\npersonnel or our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, whether engineers or others, could delay the\ndevelopment and introduction of new products and would have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our\nproducts and may impact our overall business and growth. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be\nrequired to divert the attention of other senior executives away from their original duties to recruiting replacements\nfor key personnel.\nIf we fail to forecast customer demand accurately, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may\nincrease our operating costs and harm our business.\nThe lead time required by the semiconductor manufacturing service providers is typically longer than the lead\ntime that our customers provide for delivery of our products to them. To ensure availability of our products for our\ncustomers, we will typically ask our semiconductor manufacturing service providers to start manufacturing our\nproducts based on forecasts provided by our customers in advance of receiving their purchase orders. However,\nthese forecasts are not binding purchase commitments, and we do not recognize revenues until they are delivered to\ncustomers. Moreover, for the convenience of our customers, we may agree to ship our inventory to warehouses\nlocated near our customers, so that our products can be delivered to customers more quickly. In such cases, we will\nnot recognize revenues until the control over a product is given to our customers based on the shipping terms. Hence,\nwe incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenues.\nThe anticipated demand for our products may not materialize; therefore, manufacturing based on customer\nforecasts exposes us to risks such as high inventory carrying costs, increased product obsolescence, erosion of the\nproducts’ market value as well as penalty incurred from unfulfillment of committed orders from capacity agreement\nwith Company’s foundries and backend suppliers. If we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders\nare cancelled or shipments delayed, we may incur charges from agreements entered with foundries and backend\nsuppliers for securing capacity, excess inventory that we cannot sell, or may have to sell at low profit margins or\neven at a loss, which would harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have\nsufficient inventory and may lose market share and damage customer relationships, which also could harm our\nbusiness. These inventory risks are exacerbated by the high level of customization of our products, which limits our\nability to sell excess inventory to other customers, which could eventually lead to write-down of these excess\ninventory.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future, our ability to grow will be limited.\nOur future success depends on our customers designing our products into their products. To achieve design\nwins, we must design and deliver cost-effective, innovative, reliable and integrated products for our customers’\nneeds. A panel manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs and\ntime associated with qualifying a new supplier. A design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to\npurchase our products and may not result in large volume orders of our products. Rather, it is a decision by a\ncustomer to use our products in the design process of that customer’s products. Accordingly, our failure to\nsuccessfully design, develop and introduce new products and product enhancements could harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are complex and may require modifications to resolve undetected errors or failures in order for\nthem to function with panels at the desired specifications, which could lead to higher costs, customer dispute, a\nloss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain undetected errors or failures. Our products must operate\naccording to specifications with the other components used by our customers in their product manufacturing process.\n16\nIf our products are delivered with errors or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement\ncosts, and our credibility and the market acceptance of our products could be harmed along with possible liability\nindemnification for defective product, customer disputes and lawsuits against us or our customers.\nOur highly integrated products are difficult to manufacture without defects. The existence of defects in our\nproducts could increase our costs, decrease our sales and damage our customer relationships and our\nreputation.\nThe manufacture of our products that incorporate mixed analog and digital signal processing and embedded\nmemory technology is complex and it is difficult for semiconductor foundries to manufacture them completely\nwithout defects. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process could cause substantial reduction in yield and\nquality.\nDefective products can be caused by design, defective materials or component parts, or manufacturing\ndifficulties. Thus, quality problems can be identified only by analyzing and testing our display drivers in a system\nafter they have been manufactured. Difficulties in achieving defect-free products due to the increasing complexity of\ndisplay drivers and the panel system may result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and delays in the\navailability of our products. In addition, if the foundries that we use fail to deliver products of satisfactory quality in\nthe volume and at the price required, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand or to sell those products at\nan acceptable profit margin, which could adversely affect our sales and margins and damage our customer\nrelationships and our reputation.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant\nuncertainty and volatility with respect to our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers; our sales are made on the basis of\nindividual purchase orders. Our customers may also cancel or defer purchase orders. Our customers’ purchase orders\nmay vary significantly from period-to-period, and it is difficult to forecast future order quantities. In the event of a\ncancellation, postponement, or reduction of an order, we would likely not be able to reduce operating expenses\nsufficiently so as to minimize the impact of the lost revenues. Alternatively, subject to real ever-changing\ncircumstances over the periods, we may have excess inventory that we cannot sell, which would harm our operating\nresults. In addition, changes in our customers’ business may adversely affect the quantity of purchase orders that we\nreceive by reducing or canceling their orders of our products, and/or requesting higher-than-usual price concessions.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue to place purchase orders with us in the future. We also\ncannot assure you that the volume of our customers’ purchase orders will be consistent with our expectations when\nwe plan our expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition may thus be materially and adversely\naffected. Additionally, purchase order cancelations or negative alternation by customers may lead to a reduction in\nfuture earnings or cash flows subject to each event.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by officers, directors and affiliated entities who may take\nactions that are not in, or may conflict with, our or our public shareholders’ interests.\nAs of March 31, 2023, Jordan Wu and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu (who are brothers) beneficially owned approximately\n2.1% and 22.0% of our ordinary shares, respectively. For information relating to the beneficial ownership of our\nordinary shares, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” These\nshareholders, acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders,\nincluding electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of\nownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our\nshareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might\nreduce the price of our ADSs. Actions may be taken even if they were opposed by our other shareholders.\nAssertions against us by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights could result in\nsignificant costs and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights\nand positions, which results in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have received, and\nexpect to continue to receive, notices of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. We may receive\nclaims from various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty rights in the future. Any lawsuit resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for\n17\ndamages and invalidate our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be\ntime-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential\nintellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: (1) cease and desist and/or\nstop selling products or using technology or manufacturing processes that contain the allegedly infringing\nintellectual property; (2) pay damages to the party claiming infringement; (3) attempt to obtain a license for the\nrelevant intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; and (4)\nattempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property with non-infringing\nintellectual property, which may not be possible.\nThe outcome of a dispute may result in our need to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or\nlicensing agreements. We have to undertake the contractual and tort liabilities in applicable law jurisdictions, and we\nhave agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products.\nAny intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nOur ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the\nsuccess of our business. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyright laws\nand contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual properties. These afford only limited protection. Despite our\nefforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain, copy or use information that we\nregard as proprietary, such as product design and manufacturing process expertise. Our pending patent applications\nand any future applications may not result in issued patents or may not be sufficiently broad to protect our\nproprietary technologies. Moreover, policing any unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we\ncannot be certain that the measures which we have implemented will prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use\nof our technologies, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as\nfully as the laws of the United States. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual\nproperties or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual properties. Our failure to protect our\nintellectual properties effectively could harm our business.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or investments to expand our business that may pose risks to our business and\ndilute the ownership of our existing shareholders, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these\nacquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire\nor invest in other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings,\nexpand the breadth of markets we can address or enhance our technical capabilities. Acquisitions or investments that\nwe have completed or potentially may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and\nadversely affect our business, operating and financial results, including: (1) problems integrating the acquired key\nemployees, operations, technologies or products into our existing business and products; (2) diversion of\nmanagement’s time and attention from our core business; (3) adverse effects of losses of the acquired target upon\nour financial condition and results of operations; (4) adverse effects on existing business relationships with\ncustomers; (5) the need for financial resources above our planned investment levels; (6) dilution of share ownership\nof current shareholders under share swap transactions; (7) risks associated with entering markets in which we lack\nexperience; (8) potential write-offs of acquired assets; and (9) potential impairment charges related to the goodwill\nacquired.\nWe may also face challenges in international acquisitions, such as compliance with local law and regulation,\nlimited access to target companies and cultural assimilation challenges. Our failure to address these risks\nsuccessfully may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such\nacquisition or investment may require a significant amount of capital investment, which would decrease the amount\nof cash available for working capital or capital expenditures. In addition, if we use our equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions, the value of our ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares may be diluted. If we borrow funds to\nfinance acquisitions, such debt instruments may contain restrictive covenants that can, among other things, restrict\nus from distributing dividends.\n18\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches or unexpected system outage or failures could impact our\nbusiness.\nOur computer systems and networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other malicious attempts. The reliability and\nsafety of our information technology infrastructure / software, and the ability to continually expand and update\ntechnologies / software in response to dynamic changing needs and cybersecurity threats, are critical to our business.\nIn recent years, there are increasing and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers,\nstate-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human / technological errors. All of the\nabove could result in the loss of our intellectual property, the leak of commercially sensitive information, and the\nmisappropriation of confidential information of our employees, customers and suppliers, and therefore could cause\nthe interruption of our business. Failures to protect the privacy of employees, customers or suppliers’ confidential\ndata against breaches of network security could result in the loss of existing or potential customers, other financial\nloss, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the operational cost and consequences against breaches and remedial\nmeasures could be significant. While we seek to annually review and assess our cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we still cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to\nnew and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As of March 31, 2023, we are\nnot aware of any material cyberattacks or incidents that had or would be expected to have a materially adverse effect\non our business and operations, nor had we been involved in any legal proceedings or regulatory investigations\nrelated thereto.\nOur data centers are subject to the risk of break-ins and sabotage. Our disaster recovery plan cannot account for\nall eventualities. Consequently, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our data\ncenters could result in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Some of\nour system services are based on public cloud services, which are also subject to interruption due to cloud service\nproviders’ unexpected downtimes, cyberattacks or any type of failure, telecommunication failure and/or other\nunidentified problems while connecting to cloud. These cloud services interruptions could result in loss of\nproduction capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Cloud cybersecurity breaches could\nresult in adverse effects on our customers, employees, suppliers, reputation, and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our revenues\nand operating results.\nThe price of each semiconductor product typically declines over its product life cycle, reflecting product\nobsolescence, decreased demand as customers shift to more advanced products, decreased unit costs due to\nadvanced designs or improved manufacturing yields, excess inventory destocking amidst low market demand, and\nincreased competition as more semiconductor suppliers are able to offer similar products. We may experience\nsubstantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results if our average selling prices decline. We may\nreduce the average unit price of our products in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions\nby us or our competitors, and other factors. We expect that these factors will create downward pressure on our\naverage selling prices and operating results. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by\nincreasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost reductions, or if we fail to develop and introduce\nnew products and enhancements on a timely basis, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly competitive, and\nwe cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors.\nIncreased competition in the semiconductor industry may result in pricing pressure, reduced profitability and\nloss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations. We continually face\nintense competition from fabless display driver companies and integrated device manufacturers. Some of our\ncompetitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing\nand distribution of their products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer\ndemands or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products. Some of our\ncompetitors are affiliated with, or are subsidiaries of, our panel manufacturer customers. These relationships may\nalso give our competitors significant advantages such as early access to product roadmaps and design-in priorities,\nwhich would allow them to respond more quickly to changing customer demands and achieve more design-wins\n19\nthan we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues and market share or\ncompete successfully against our competitors in the semiconductor industry.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to anticipate changes in evolving industry\nstandards, fail to achieve and maintain technological leadership in our industry or fail to develop and\nintroduce new and enhanced products.\nOur products are generally based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The emergence of new\nindustry standards could render our products or those of our customers unmarketable or obsolete and may require us\nto incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any such new standards. Our past sales and profitability have\nresulted, to a significant extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards, and to\ndevelop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely fashion. If we do not anticipate these changes in\ntechnologies and rapidly develop and introduce new and innovative technologies, we may not be able to provide\nadvanced display semiconductors on competitive terms, and some of our customers may buy products from our\ncompetitors instead of from us. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes and anticipate future standards will be\na significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our growth prospects. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to anticipate evolving industry standards, successfully complete the design of our\nnew products, have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields, or obtain significant purchase\norders for these products to meet new standards or technologies. If we fail to anticipate changes in technology and to\nintroduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business and results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure\nOur ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by\ncommercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow,\nfund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist mainly of our 100% ownership interest in Himax Taiwan. We\nreceive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends\nin the past. Nonetheless, dividends and interest on shareholder loans that we receive from our subsidiaries in Taiwan,\nif any, will be subject to withholding tax under ROC law. The ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with loans,\npay dividends, repay any shareholder loans from us or make other distributions to us is restricted by, among other\nthings, the availability of funds, the terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as\nstatutory and other legal restrictions. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, pay dividends, and otherwise\nfund and conduct our business.\nPolitical, Geographical and Economic Risks\nClimate change and natural disasters could adversely affect our business.\nClimate change concerns has led to international legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon\ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of compliance, including costs associated with\nchanges to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, increased\ncapital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce\nemissions, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional\ncompliance costs that are passed on to us, which could harm our business and financial results by increasing our\nexpenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities.\nIn addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters to occur more frequently or with greater\nintensity. Most of our operations, and the operations of many of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers,\nsuppliers and customers are located in Taiwan, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, in particular, earthquakes\nand typhoons. Our principal foundries, tape and assembly and testing houses upon which we have relied to\nmanufacture substantially all of our display drivers are located in Taiwan. As a result of this geographic\nconcentration, disruption of operations at our facilities or the facilities of our semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders and suppliers for any reason, including work stoppages, power outages, water supply shortages, fire,\ntyphoons, earthquakes or other natural disasters, could cause delays in production and shipments of our products. In\naddition, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy\n20\nof the government, such as to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country. Any delays or disruptions could result in our\ncustomers seeking to source products from our competitors. If such disruption of operation at our customers’\nfacilities and our customers may be required to shut down temporarily or to substantially reduce the operations of\ntheir fabs, these would seriously affect demand for our products.\nDisruptions in Taiwan’s political environment could negatively affect our business and ADSs market price.\nOur principal executive offices and a substantial amount of our assets are located in Taiwan, and a substantial\nportion of revenues is derived from operations in Taiwan. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ADSs market price may be affected by changes in ROC policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, and by\nsocial instability and diplomatic issues that are outside of our control.\nTaiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and the PRC have been separately\ngoverned. The government of the PRC claims that it is the sole government in China and that Taiwan is part of\nChina. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between\nTaiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has refused to renounce the possibility that it may at some point use\nforce to gain control over Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC government adopted an anti-secession law relating to\nTaiwan. Relations between the ROC and the PRC governments have been strained in recent years for a variety of\nreasons, including the PRC government’s position on the “One China” policy and tensions concerning arms sales to\nTaiwan by the United States government. Any tension between the ROC and the PRC, or between the United States\nand the PRC, could materially and adversely affect our ADSs market prices.\nA substantial portion of our sales are made to customers in the PRC, which may expose us to additional\npolitical, regulatory, and economic risks.\nWe have been increasingly selling our products to customers in the PRC. In 2021 and 2022, approximately\n81.5% and 77.0% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in the PRC. We expect to\ncontinue to increase our sales to customers in the PRC in the future. With regional customer concentration, we are\nparticularly subject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in the PRC.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the\nstructure, level of government involvement, level of development, foreign exchange control and allocation of\nresources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy\nand is growing rapidly. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures\nemphasizing utilization of market forces in the development of the economy and also adjusted its macroeconomic\ncontrol policies from time to time. These policies have led and may continue to lead to changes in market conditions.\nFurther, if new, US sanctions are imposed on China and any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are\nimplemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory\ntrade actions due to recent U.S.-China trade tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our customers or\nsuppliers in China. We cannot predict whether changes in the PRC’s political, economic and social conditions, laws,\nregulations and policies will have any adverse effect on our customers in the PRC. In addition, the interpretation of\nPRC laws and regulations involves uncertainties. We cannot assure you that changes in such laws and regulations, or\nin their interpretation and enforcement, will not have a material adverse effect on the businesses and operations of\nour customers in the PRC and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses and affect our results of operations.\nOur functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. In 2022, more than 99% of our revenues and cost of\nrevenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency exposure and are primarily affected\nby fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar. This is because a majority portion of\nour employees and facilities are based in Taiwan and operating expenses are denominated in NT dollars and we\nmaintain a portion of our cash in NT dollars for Taiwan working capital purposes. For example, in December 2022,\napproximately 61% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage\ndenominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi, and the majority of the remainder in U.S.\ndollars. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in exchange rate of U.S. dollars against such\ncurrencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our\noperating expenses as expressed in U.S. dollar and adversely affect our operating profit.\n21\nChanges in ROC tax laws would likely increase our tax expenditures and decrease our net income.\nThe Company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a tax-free country; accordingly, pretax income generated\nby the group parent company is not subject to local income tax. Substantially all of the Company’s taxable income is\nderived from the operations in the ROC and we are exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government.\nAny unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase our effective tax rate and\nhave an adverse effect on our operating results. See “Item 5.A. Operating and Financial Reviews and\nProspects —Operating Results—Tax Credits” for further discussion of significant tax regulation changes.\nOn July 12, 2016, the ROC Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of anti-avoidance to establish Article 43-3\nControlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules and Article 43-4 Place of Effective Management (“PEM”) rules of the\nIncome Tax Act (“ITA”). Detailed introduction of the CFC and PEM rules are described as follows:\n(i) A profit-seeking enterprise (“PSE”) that directly or indirectly owns affiliated enterprises in low-tax\njurisdictions outside the territory of the ROC shall recognize and include its pro rata share of affiliated\nenterprises’ annual profits as investment income in its income tax return for the year. Subsequent\nactual dividends and distributions from such affiliated enterprises that were previously recognized as\ninvestment income will then not be subject to income taxation; any surplus to previously recognized\ninvestment income shall be included as taxable income in the allocated year. Low-tax jurisdictions are\ndefined as countries where the PSE income tax rate is lower than 70% of the income tax rate of the\nPSE in the ROC (the statutory income tax rate is 20% from January 1, 2018) (Article 43-3 CFC rules);\nand\n(ii) A PSE is incorporated based on foreign legislation but its place of effective management (PEM) is\nmaintained within the territory of the ROC, and the head office of such PSE will be determined to be\nwithin the territory of the ROC and profit-seeking enterprise income tax shall be levied in accordance\nwith the ITA and relevant tax regulations. The aforementioned PEM refers to a place where\nsubstantive key management and commercial decisions of an entity’s business and its operations are\nmade (Article 43-4 PEM rule).\nAccording to the legislative intent, the CFC and PEM rules, in principle, will not be put into force immediately,\nbut will wait until the China-Taiwan Cross-Strait Tax Agreement is effectuated, the OECD’s Common Reporting\nand Due Diligence Standard (“CRS”) for the automatic exchange of information of financial accounts is widely\nimplemented internationally, and the relevant bylaws of the CFC and PEM rules have been adequately enacted and\nproperly advocated. The date of implementation will be determined by the Executive Yuan. On January 14, 2022,\nExecutive Yuan had announced the relevant bylaws of the CFC would be implemented from January 1, 2023 and we\nexpect that CFC would have no material impact to affect our operating profit.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However,\nif the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be\ndetermined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income\nTax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax\nin the ROC.\nWe may be affected by the Cayman Economic Substance Law\nPursuant to the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision) (as amended) of the\nCayman Islands (the “ES Act”), a “relevant entity” is required to satisfy the economic substance test set out in the\nES Act. A “relevant entity” includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands as is our company.\nBased on the current interpretation of the ES Act, we believe that our company, Himax Technologies, Inc., is a pure\nequity holding company since it only holds equity participation in other entities and only earns dividends and capital\ngains.\nAccordingly, for so long as our company is a “pure equity holding company”, it is only subject to the minimum\nsubstance requirements, which require us to (i) comply with all applicable filing requirements under the Companies\nAct (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands; and (ii) have adequate human resources and adequate premises in the\nCayman Islands for holding and managing equity participations in other entities. However, there can be no\nassurance that we will not be subject to more requirements under the ES Act. Uncertainties over the interpretation\nand implementation of the ES Act may have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\n22\nRisks Relating to Our ADSs and Our Trading Market\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile.\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile and has ranged from a low of $4.81 to a high of $16.28 on the\nNASDAQ Global Select Market in 2022.\nThe market price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: (1)\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (2) changes in financial estimates by securities\nresearch analysts; (3) changes in the expectation of our product launch timing, forecast and estimates; (4) conditions\nin the TFT-LCD and OLED panel market; (5) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other\ndisplay semiconductor companies; (6) announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions,\nstrategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (7) the addition or departure of key personnel; (8)\nfluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar; (9) litigation related to our intellectual\nproperty; and (10) the release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or sales of additional\nADSs.\nIn addition, as a result of the worldwide financial crisis, business and manufacture disruptions caused by\nCovid-19 mandates, and global developments relating to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global stock markets have\nexperienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices\nof securities issued by many companies for reasons which may not be directly related to their operating performance,\nincluding but not limited to events such as tax-loss selling, mutual fund redemptions, hedge fund redemptions and\nmargin calls. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs.\nFuture sales or perceived sales of securities by us, our executive officers, directors or major shareholders may\nhurt the price of our ADSs.\nThe market price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales of ADSs or shares or the perception that these\nsales could occur. As of March 31, 2023, we had 348,833,050 outstanding shares and a significant number of our\nshares were beneficially owned by certain major shareholders such as our directors and executive officers. See “Item\n7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” If we, our executive officers, or\ndirectors or our shareholders sell ADSs or shares, the market price for our shares or ADSs could decline.\nYou may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting\nmaterials sufficiently in advance to be able to exercise your right to vote.\nExcept as described in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights\nattaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the\ndepositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by\nthe ADSs. In certain circumstances, the depositary shall refrain from voting and any voting instructions received\nfrom ADS holders shall lapse. Furthermore, in certain other circumstances, the depositary will give us a\ndiscretionary proxy to vote shares evidenced by ADSs. You may not receive voting materials sufficiently in advance\nto instruct the depositary to vote or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties will\nnot have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under\nthe deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights\nand the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act, or\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation to\nfile a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a\nregistration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions\nfrom registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our\nrights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.\nYou may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.\nYour ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary\nmay close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenever it deems expedient in connection with the\n23\nperformance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of ADSs\ngenerally when books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary deem it\nnecessary or advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, any government, governmental body,\ncommission, or any securities exchange on which our ADSs or ordinary shares are listed, or under any provision of\nthe deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the deposited securities or any meeting of our shareholders, or\nfor any other reason.\nYour ability to protect your rights through the United States federal courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct a substantial portion of our operations in Taiwan, and all of\nour directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. However, a substantial portion of our operations is conducted in\nTaiwan through Himax Taiwan, our wholly owned subsidiary, and substantially all of our assets are located in\nTaiwan. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of\nthose persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an\naction against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have\nbeen infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind,\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to enforce a United States judgment against\nour assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of\njudgments obtained in the United States, although a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of\nthe United States under which a sum of money is payable, other than a sum payable in respect of multiple damages,\ntaxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, may be subject to enforcement\nproceedings as debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation, provided that\n(a) such federal or state courts of the United States had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment;\n(b) such federal or state courts of the United States did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman\nIslands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to\nthe public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to\nthe rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct\nprocedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\nTherefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against\nour management, directors or major shareholders than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in\nthe United States.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder because judicial precedents regarding\nshareholders’ rights are more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, and because Cayman\nIslands law generally provides less protection to shareholders than U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law, Cap. 22\n(Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman Islands Companies Law, and\nthe common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against directors, actions by\nminority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a\nlarge extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law is derived in part from\ncomparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has\npersuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes\nor judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less\ndeveloped body of securities law than the United States.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n4.A. History and Development of the Company\nHimax Taiwan, our predecessor, was incorporated on June 12, 2001 as a limited liability company under the\nlaws of the ROC. On April 26, 2005, we established Himax Technologies Limited, an exempted company with\nlimited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as a holding company to hold the shares of Himax\nTaiwan in connection with our reorganization and share exchange. On October 14, 2005, Himax Taiwan became our\nwholly owned subsidiary through a share exchange consummated pursuant to the ROC Business Mergers and\nAcquisitions Law through which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Himax Taiwan, and we\n24\nissued ordinary shares to the shareholders of Himax Taiwan. Shareholders of Himax Taiwan received one of our\nordinary shares in exchange for one Himax Taiwan common share. The share exchange was unanimously approved\nby shareholders of Himax Taiwan on June 10, 2005 with no dissenting shareholders and by the ROC Investment\nCommission on August 30, 2005 for our inbound investment in Taiwan, and on September 7, 2005 for our outbound\ninvestment outside of Taiwan. We effected this reorganization and share exchange to comply with ROC laws, which\nprohibit a Taiwan incorporated company not otherwise publicly listed in Taiwan from listing its shares on an\noverseas stock exchange. Our reorganization enables us to maintain our operations through our Taiwan subsidiary,\nHimax Taiwan, while allowing us to list our shares overseas through our holding company structure.\nOn September 26, 2005, we changed our name to “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” and on October 17, 2005, Himax\nTaiwan changed its name to “Himax Technologies Limited” upon the approval of shareholders of both companies\nand amendments to the respective constitutive documents. We effected the name exchange in order to maintain\ncontinuity of operations and marketing under the trade name “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” which had been\npreviously used by Himax Taiwan.\nOur ADSs have been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since March 31, 2006. Our ordinary shares\nare not listed or publicly traded on any trading markets.\nIn February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wisepal, currently known as Himax Semiconductor, Inc., a\nfabless semiconductor company focusing on the development of LTPS TFT-LCD drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications.

Business Overview\nWe are a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. We are\na worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile\nphones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer\nelectronics devices. Additionally, we design and provide controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and\nDisplay Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, AMOLED ICs, LED driver ICs, power management ICs\nand LCoS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. We also\n25\noffer CMOS image sensors, wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and ultralow power WiseEye smart\nimage sensing, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera,\nautomobile, security, medical devices, home appliance, AIoT, etc. For display drivers and display-related products,\nour customers are panel manufacturers, agents or distributors, module manufacturers, assembly houses or end\ncustomers. We also work with camera module manufacturers, optical engine manufacturers, television / AIoT\nsystem manufacturers and certain AIoT system integration companies for various non-driver products.\nIndustry Background\nWe mainly operate in the flat panel display semiconductor industry. As the majority of our revenues derive\nfrom products that are critical components of flat panel displays, such as display drivers, timing controllers, power\nICs and other semiconductor products, our industry is closely linked to the trends and developments of the flat panel\ndisplay industry.\nFlat Panel Display Semiconductors\nFlat panel displays require different semiconductors depending upon the display technologies and the\napplications. Some of the most important ones include the following:\nDisplay Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers precise\n⚫\nanalog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The major application of display driver IC is\nused on TFT-LCDs. Other than display drivers for TFT-LCDs, we also offer display drivers for AMOLED\nand Electronic Paper (e-paper) Displays. AMOLED display is getting more and more popular in recent\nyears, starting from high-end smartphone and TV applications, while e-paper display mimics traditional\npaper sheet and holds static text and images indefinitely without electricity. Detailed display driver IC\nspecification for LCD, AMOLED and e-paper are different due to panel characteristics. The two main types\nof display drivers for a display panel are gate drivers and source drivers. Gate drivers turn on the transistor\nwithin each pixel cell on the horizontal line on the panel for data input at each row. Source drivers receive\nimage data from the timing controller and generate voltage that is applied to the liquid crystal within each\npixel cell on the vertical line on the panel for data input at each column. The combination determines the\ncolors generated by each pixel. Typically, multiple gate drivers and source drivers are installed separately\non the panel. However, for certain small and medium-sized applications, gate drivers and source drivers are\nintegrated into a single chip due to space and cost considerations. Large-sized panels typically have higher\nresolution and require more display drivers than small and medium-sized panels. In addition, TDDI IC\nintegrates both display driver and in-cell touch functions and is usually adopted by small and medium sized\ndisplay applications. For certain highly integrated application, such as smartphone, Timing Controller\nfeature is also embedded in TDDI.\nTiming Controller. The timing controller receives image data and converts the format for the source\n⚫\ndrivers’ input. The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate and source drivers.\nTypically, the timing controller is a discrete semiconductor in large-sized TFT-LCD, AMOLED and\ne-paper panels. For certain small and medium-sized applications, however, the timing controller may be\nintegrated with display drivers.\nOperational Amplifier. An operational amplifier supplies the reference voltage to source drivers in order to\n⚫\nmake their output voltage uniform.\nPower IC. Power ICs include certain drivers, amplifiers, DC to DC converters and other semiconductors\n⚫\ndesigned to enhance power management, such as voltage regulation, voltage boosting and battery\nmanagement.\nTouch Controller IC. For touch screen applications, touch controller ICs enable touch interfaces, such as\n⚫\ncapacitive touch panels, to identify, qualify and track user’s contacts with precision and sensibility.\nOthers. Flat panel displays also require multiple general purposes semiconductors such as memory, power\n⚫\nconverters and inverters.\n26\nCharacteristics of the Display Driver Market\nAlthough we operate in several distinct segments of the flat panel display semiconductor industry, our principal\nproducts are display drivers. Display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays. The display driver market\nhas specific characteristics, including those discussed below.\nConcentration of Panel Manufacturers\nThe global TFT-LCD panel industry consists of a small number of manufacturers, substantially all of which are\nbased in Asia. In recent years, Korean TFT-LCD panel makers have gradually undergone restructurings to shift their\ntechnology and manufacture focus from TFT-LCD to OLED and TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, especially\nChina-based manufacturers which have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct and ramp up\nadditional fab capacity. The capital-intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel manufacturers\noperating at a high level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to create a temporary\noversupply of panels, which reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing pressure on component\ncompanies including display driver companies. Moreover, the concentration of panel manufacturers permits major\npanel manufacturers to exert pricing pressure on display driver companies such as us. The small number of panel\nmanufacturers exacerbates this situation as display driver companies, in addition to seeking to expand their customer\nbase, must also focus on winning a larger percentage of such customers’ display driver requirements.\nCustomization Requirements\nEach panel display has a unique pixel design to meet its particular requirements. To optimize the panel’s\nperformance, display drivers have to be customized for each panel design. The most common customization\nrequirement is for the display driver company to optimize the gamma curve of each display driver for each panel\ndesign. Display driver companies must work closely with their customers to develop semiconductors that meet their\ncustomers’ specific needs in order to optimize the performance of their products.\nMixed-Signal Design and High-Voltage CMOS Process Technology\nDisplay drivers have specific design and manufacturing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor\nindustry. Some display drivers require mixed-signal design since they combine both analog and digital devices on a\nsingle semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data. Manufacturing display drivers require\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5 to 24 volts for source drivers and 10 to 50 volts\nfor gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in the semiconductor industry. For display drivers, the\ndriving voltage must be maintained under a very high degree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve using\nstandard CMOS process technology. Moreover, manufacturing display drivers does not require very small-geometry\nsemiconductor processes. Typically, the manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require geometries\nbetween 0.11 micron and 1 micron because the physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not allow for the\neconomical reduction in geometries below this range. We believe that there are a limited number of fabs with\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing of display drivers.\nSpecial Assembly and Testing Requirements\nManufacturing display drivers requires certain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that are not\nstandard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited number of providers. The assembly of display drivers\ntypically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass, also known as COG,\ntechnologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold bumps are plated onto\neach wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and the glass, in the case of COG\npackages. TAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip on film, also known as COF. The type\nof assembly used depends on the panel manufacturer’s design, which is influenced by panel size and application and\nis typically determined by the panel manufacturers. Display drivers for large-sized applications typically require\nTAB package and, to a lesser extent, COG package types, whereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and\nconsumer electronics products typically require COG packages. The testing of display drivers also requires special\ntesters that can support high-channel and high-voltage output semiconductors. Such testers are not standard in the\nsemiconductor industry.\n27\nSupply Chain Management\nThe manufacturing of display drivers is complex and requires several manufacturing stages such as wafer\nfabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing, and the availability of materials such as the processed tape\nused in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and material requirements collectively as the\n“supply chain”. Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of capacity utilization and require a reliable\nsupply of display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this supply, may disrupt panel\nmanufacturers’ operations. As a result, a company’s ability to deliver its products on a timely basis at the quality and\nquantity required is critical to satisfying its existing customers and winning new ones. Such supply chain\nmanagement is particularly crucial to fabless display driver companies that do not have their own in-house\nmanufacturing capacity. In the case of display drivers, supply chain management is further complicated by the\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology and the special assembly and testing requirements that are not standard in\nthe semiconductor industry. Access to this capacity also depends in part on display driver companies having\nreceived assurances of demand for their products since semiconductor manufacturing service providers require\ncredible demand forecasts before allocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity to\nsupport growth.\nNeed for Higher Level of Integration\nThe small form factor of smartphone, tablet, automotive and certain consumer electronics products restricts the\nspace for components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically require one or more source drivers, one\nor more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors or as an integrated\nsingle-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order to manufacture more\ncompact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display driver companies must be able\nto offer highly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver and timing controller, as well as\nsemiconductors such as memory, power circuit and image processors, into a single chip. Due to the size restrictions\nand stringent power consumption constraints of such display drivers, single-chip drivers are complex to design. For\nlarge-sized panel applications, integration is both more difficult to achieve and less important since size and weight\nare less of a priority. Lastly, as some of our TFT-LCD panel customers had turned to pure in-cell TDDI panel\ndevelopment for thinner display designs, we have developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated\ncircuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.\nProducts and Solutions\nWe have several principal product lines:\n• Display drivers and timing controllers;\n• ASIC service;\n• LCoS and MEMS products;\n• Power ICs;\n• CMOS image sensor products;\n• Wafer level optics products;\n• 3D sensing business; and\n• Ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing.\nDisplay Drivers and Timing Controllers\nDisplay Driver Characteristics\nDisplay drivers deliver precise analog voltages and currents that activate the pixels on panels. The following is a\nsummary of certain display driver characteristics and their relationship to panel performance.\n28\nResolution and Number of Channels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied by the\n⚫\nnumber of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed on a panel. For\nexample, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red columns, 1,024 green columns and\n1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and 768 rows. The red, green and blue columns are\ncommonly referred to as “RGB.” Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072 column outputs and 768\nrow outputs. The number of display drivers required for each panel depends on the resolution of the panel\nand the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) panel requires\neight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three 256-channel gate drivers (768 = 256 x 3),\nwhile a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel requires eight 720-channel source drivers and four\n270-channel gate drivers. The number of display drivers required can be reduced by using drivers with a\nhigher number of channels. For example, a full HD panel can have six 960-channel source drivers instead\nof eight 720-channel source drivers. Thus, using display drivers with a higher number of channels can\nreduce the number of display drivers required for each panel, although display drivers with a higher number\nof channels typically have higher unit costs.\nColor Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a screen, which is determined by\n⚫\nthe number of shades of a color, also known as gray scale, that can be shown by the panel. For example, a\n6-bit source driver is capable of generating 26 x 26 x 26 = 218, or 262K colors, and similarly, an 8-bit source\ndriver is capable of generating 16 million colors. Typically, for TFT-LCD panels currently in commercial\nproduction, 262K, 16 million and 1 billion colors are supported by 6-bit, 8-bit and 10-bit source drivers,\nrespectively.\nOperational Voltage. A display driver operates with two voltages: the input voltage (which enables it to\n⚫\nreceive signals from the timing controller) and the output voltage (which, in the case of source drivers, is\napplied to liquid crystals and, in the case of gate drivers, is used to switch on the TFT device). Source\ndrivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from 4.5 to 24\nvolts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from\n10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers electromagnetic interference, or EMI. Output\nvoltage may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the liquid crystal (or diode), in the case\nof source drivers, or TFT device, in the case of gate drivers.\nGamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to it by\n⚫\nthe source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve” of the source driver. Different panel\ndesign and manufacturing processes require source drivers with different gamma curves. Display drivers\nneed to adjust the gamma curve to fit the pixel design. Due to the materials and processes used in\nmanufacturing, panels may contain certain imperfections which can be corrected by the gamma curve of\nthe source driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma correction.” For certain types of liquid\ncrystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly different and thus need to be independently\ncorrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three independent gamma curves for RGB cells.\nDriver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display drivers.\n⚫\nDisplay drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data\nvolume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data transmission applications, such as\ntelevisions, require more advanced interface technology. The principal types of interface technologies are\ntransistor-to-transistor logic, or TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS, mini-low voltage\ndifferential signaling, or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high-speed interface. Among these, RSDS,\nmini-LVDS and point-to-point interface were developed as low power, low noise and low amplitude\nmethods for high-speed data transmission using fewer copper wires and resulting in lower EMI. Moreover,\nthere are some panel manufacturers developing their proprietary point-to-point interfaces, such as\nembedded panel interface, or EPI, USI-T, iSP, CEDS, CHPI, CSPI and CMPI.\nPackage Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses TAB and COG package types. COF and TCP\n⚫\nare two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly used in recent years.\nCustomers typically determine the package type required according to their specific mechanical and\nelectrical considerations. In general, display drivers for small-sized panels mainly use COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for large-sized panels primarily use TAB package types and, to a lesser extent,\nCOG package types.\n29\nLarge-Sized Applications\nWe provide source drivers, gate drivers, PMIC, P-gamma OP level shifter and timing controllers (TCON) for\nlarge-sized panels principally used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and televisions. Display drivers used in\nlarge-sized applications feature different key characteristics, depending on the end-use application. For example, the\nindustry trend for large-sized applications is generally toward super high channel, low power consumption, low cost,\nthin and light form factor, touch function, higher data transmission rate and higher driving capabilities. Higher speed\ninterface technologies are also key for 4Kx2K and 8Kx4K high-resolution TVs. Greater color depth, thermal\nsolution, high data rate and high driving, are particularly important for advanced televisions and certain monitors.\nOur large display driver IC business achieved several milestones from 2019. For example, we successfully\nadded 12-inch fabs into the pool of our foundry capacity for our large display driver ICs to ease the capacity\nshortage of 8” foundry where the vast majority of large panel driver ICs are fabricated. On high-end TV, Himax\noutpaced peers to lead the mass production of customized high-speed point-to-point (P2P) transmission using\nembedded panel intra interface such as iSP, CHPI, USI-T, CMPI, CEDS and CSPI for 4K TVs and 8K TV. On\ngaming monitor, we have high frame rate and high driving driver to meet various resolutions needs and frame rates\nsuch as UHD 240Hz, QHD 360Hz, FHD 480Hz, etc. We also successfully developed low power consumption driver\napplied in low power monitor to satisfied Energy Star 8.0 and even Energy Star 9.0. Lastly, our P2P driver and\nTCON ICs with 13.3\" FHD can meet Intel 1W project requirements.\nWe also made tremendous progress in TCON product lines in 2022. The UHD TV penetration rate is larger than\n65% in 2022, and we developed competitive UHD TV TCON to seize this market. Himax UHD TV TCON has mass\nproduction at all major China LCD makers. We also provide gaming TCON for the new QHD 360Hz and UHD\n240Hz gaming monitor and notebook. For high-end gaming requirement, we have developed eDP 8.1G TCON to\nincrease bandwidth.\nThe table below sets forth the features of our products for large-sized applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers 384 to 1920 output channels\n⚫\n6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16 million colors) or 10-bit (1 billion\n⚫\ncolors)\none gamma-type driver\n⚫\ntwo gamma-type drivers to improve display quality\n⚫\nthree gamma-type drivers (RGB independent gamma curve to\n⚫\nenhance color image)\noutput driving voltage ranging from 7 up to 20V\n⚫\ninput logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n⚫\nand support half VDDA\nlow power consumption and low EMI\n⚫\nsupport COF and COG package types\n⚫\nsupport TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS (up to 460MHz), cascade\n⚫\nmodulated driver interface, or CMDI, point-to-point high speed\ninterface (up to 4Gbps for 8K 120Hz) and customized interface\ntechnologies\nsupport dual gate and triple gate panel designs\n⚫\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers 192 to 1600 output channels\n⚫\noutput driving voltage ranging from 10 up to 40v\n⚫\ninput logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n⚫\nlow power consumption\n⚫\nsupport COF and COG package types\n⚫\nsupport dual gate and triple gate panel designs\n⚫\nTiming Controllers product portfolio supports a wide range of resolutions, from VGA\n⚫\n(640 x 480 pixels) to full HD, UHD and 8K4K (1,920 x 1,080 pixels,\n1,920 x 1,200 pixels, 3840 x 2160 and 7680 x 4320)\nsupport mini-LVDS, point-to-point high speed interface and\n⚫\ncustomized output interface technologies\n30\nProduct Features\nembedded overdrive function to improve response time\n⚫\nsupport CABC and local dimming to save power and color engine to\n⚫\nenhance color and sharpness\nsupport LVDS, eDP, MIPI and V-by-one input interface technologies\n⚫\nsupport dual-gate, triple-gate, GOA (gate on array) and RGBW panel\n⚫\ndesigns\nsupport amorphous silicon, IGZO and LTPS panel\n⚫\nASIC AMOLED Timing Controller\n⚫\nASIC uLED Timing Controller\n⚫\nProgrammable Gamma OP 8 to 16 channel gamma buffer outputs\n⚫\nchannel VCOM buffer output\n⚫\nInternal non-volatile memory\n⚫\n2 gamma bank selection, setting time < 3uS\n⚫\nAnalog power supply voltage: 9.0V to 20.0V\n⚫\nDigital power supply voltage: 2.7V to 3.6V\n⚫\nPeak current on gamma channels: 200mA\n⚫\nPeak current on VCOM channel: 400mA\n⚫\nProgrammable VCOM limit\n⚫\n12C speed up to 1MHz\n⚫\nSmall and Medium-Sized Applications\nAutomotive Display Applications\nWe offer source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers and integrated drivers for the fast-ramping automotive\ndisplay applications, such as instrument cluster display (ICD), center stack display (CSD), head-up display (HUD),\nrear seat entertainment display (RSE), rearview mirror display and sideview mirror display.\nThe automotive display drivers can support various display resolutions to meet the customized needs of\nautomotive display, including GIP panel and non-GIP panel, a-Si TFT panel and LTPS panel. Meanwhile, the\nautomotive display drivers can support higher output driving voltage for higher contrast ratio and faster liquid\ncrystal response in automotive display applications. The automotive Timing Controller can support Local Dimming\nfunction for the goal of higher contrast ratio and thermal reduction in automotive display applications. We launched\nthe world’s first TDDI design for automotive displays technology which started shipping in 2019 with meaningful\nmass production shipment to industrial leading automotive panel house, Tier-1 and brands starting 2021.Himax is\nthe market leader in automotive display driver business covering the entire spectrum of products and technologies,\nincluding the industry’s most comprehensive traditional DDIC product offerings as well as leading solutions for new\ntechnology areas such as TDDI, local dimming Tcon, LTDI and AMOLED. Our automotive TDDI is broadly\nadopted by named Tier 1s and auto makers in their new launches of vehicles. Himax also have reached over 10\nmillion units shipment accumulated in the third quarter of 2022, a milestone that, demonstrates a robust growing\ntrajectory moving forward. With the commencement of TDDI mass production and LTDI thereafter starting 2023,\nwe are confident that our overall market share in the automotive display driver market will continue to rise in the\ncoming years and our technological prowess continues to separate us from peers for the next generation display for\nautomotive. In addition, on TCON ICs for automotives, we also have embedded local dimming feature in TCON for\nTFT-LCD to support higher contrast instrument panels needed for drivers to read the content of the meter quickly.\nAdditionally, several key panel makers also seek Himax cooperation to develop AMOLED for automotive\napplications. We have developed certain customized AMOLED ASIC for some of these key panel makers where\nsome already started mass production in 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our products used in automotive display applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers 642 to 1,920 output channels\n⚫\n6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16.7 million colors)\n⚫\nsupport RSDS, mini-LVDS, Point-to-Point interfaces\n⚫\noutput driving voltage ranging up to 15V\n⚫\nsupport COG and COF package type\n⚫\n31\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers 100 to 1,600 output channels\n⚫\noutput driving voltage ranging up to 40V\n⚫\nsupport COG and COF package type\n⚫\nTFT-LCD Integrated Drivers highly integrated chip embedded with source driver, timing controller\n⚫\nand power circuit\nsupport RGB, LVDS input interfaces\n⚫\nsupport Single Gate, Dual Gate, Triple Gate panel structure\n⚫\nsupport 2MUX, 3MUX, 4MUX, 6MUX LTPS panel structure\n⚫\nsupport GIP panel (a-TFT GIP or LTPS GIP or IGZO GIP) and\n⚫\nnon-GIP panel\nsupport resolution up to 2880 RGBx1080 (or 3840 RGBx810) with\n⚫\ncascaded chips\nsource driver output driving voltage ranging up to ±6.6V or 16V\n⚫\nsupport Fail Detect Function, including CRC Function\n⚫\nsupport Local Dimming Function\n⚫\nsupport Telltale OSD function\n⚫\nsupport COG and COF package type\n⚫\nTiming Controllers support LVDS, eDP 1.2 input interface\n⚫\nsupport mini-LVDS, Point-to-Point output interfaces\n⚫\nsupport Single Gate, Dual Gate, Triple Gate panel structure\n⚫\nsupport 2MUX, 3MUX, 6MUX LTPS panel structure\n⚫\nsupport GIP panel (a-TFT GIP or LTPS GIP or IGZO GIP) and\n⚫\nnon-GIP panel\nsupport various resolutions up to 4K2K(ICD) or 8K1K(CID)\n⚫\nsupport Local Dimming Function\n⚫\nsupport Dual Cell Panel Structure Function\n⚫\nsupport Fail Detect Function, including CRC Function\n⚫\nsupport Over Driver & De-mura function\n⚫\nsupport Telltale OSD function\n⚫\nTFT-LCD TDDI highly integrated chip embedded with source driver, timing\n⚫\ncontroller, touch controller and power circuit\nsupport LVDS input interfaces\n⚫\nsupport Single Gate, Dual Gate, Triple Gate a-TFT panel structure\n⚫\nsupport 2MUX, 3MUX, 4MUX and 6MUX LTPS panel structure\n⚫\nsupport GIP panel (a-TFT GIP or LTPS GIP) and non-GIP panel\n⚫\nsupport resolution up to 5760RBx720 with 3 chips cascaded\n⚫\nsource driver output driving voltage ranging up to ±6.6V\n⚫\nsupport Fail Detect Function, including CRC Function\n⚫\nsupport Telltale OSD function\n⚫\nsupport Color Engine function\n⚫\nsupport COG package type\n⚫\nTFT-LCD LTDI Large-sized Touch and Display Integration solution\n⚫\nsupport point-to-point iSP input interface\n⚫\nsupport resolution up to 12K1K with multi-chip cascaded\n⚫\nsupport COF and COG package types\n⚫\nAMOLED Solutions ⚫ ASIC TCON and Driver IC chipset designed to meet customized\nrequirements for automotive\n32\nSmartphone and Tablet Applications\nWe offer display drivers for small and medium-sized displays in smartphone and tablet applications that\ncombine source driver, gate driver, timing controller, DC to DC circuits, and optional frame buffer into a single chip\nor cascades chips in various display technologies, such as TFT-LCD and AMOLED.\nSmartphones and tablet have gained greater popularity among small and medium-sized display drivers and\nenjoyed high growth in recent years. This has also contributed to increased demand for larger size and higher\nresolution smartphone displays. In 2016, Himax developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated\ncircuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel. Himax started the shipments of in-cell TDDI for some\nsmartphones in 2016 and extended TDDI solution to tablet application in 2017. In-cell TDDI, featuring thinner\ndisplay, slimmer border, and better visual quality, has been getting popular, so we re-invented a new generation of\nTDDIs supporting COG and COF for 18:9 or wider aspect ratio with interlaced output pins, which makes the bottom\nborder of the in-cell touch display even smaller to gain higher display to body ratio. Our FHD+ and HD+ TDDI\nsuccessfully gained design-wins with a few leading Korean and Chinese smartphone brands and panel makers. We\nstarted small volume shipments in the first half of 2018 with accelerating volume starting in the second half of 2018\ninto 2019 and beyond. Starting in 2020, Himax extended our product offerings with high frame rate TDDI solution\nand has started shipping to top-tier smartphone OEMs.\nA major development we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the AMOLED display for\nsmartphone, smart watch, automotive and tablet. This is due to investments on expanded AMOLED capacity as well\nas increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED display for the\ntime being. We are collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China and Korea for AMOLED product\ndevelopment in smartphone, tablet, automotive and other consumer electronics. In the first quarter of 2022, the\nCompany’s flexible AMOLED driver and Tcon for automotive display successfully ramped up for a customer’s\nflagship EV model, while in the second quarter of 2022, the Company commenced production of AMOLED TCON\nand Driver IC chipsets for tablet applications for a leading OEM for their 11-inch and 12.6-inch flagship models.\nConcurrently, the number of awarded projects in AMOLED for automotive and tables with worldwide named\nvendors is increasing. We believe AMOLED solutions, including driver ICs and Tcons, will become one of the\nmajor growth engines for the Company moving forward.\nOn the other hand, the application of in-cell TDDI started to extend from mainstream smartphone to larger\ndisplays in 2018. Himax started to offer various new TDDI solutions for tablet, smart speakers, and even some\ninfotainment displays in automobiles. The first tablet TDDI with WXGA resolution went into mass production in\n2018 and also extended to leading smart speaker applications as well. In 2019, Himax announced a series of new\ndriver and TDDIs for tablet application. The COF packaged driver IC solution enabled one leading tablet OEM to\nsuccessfully launch a WQXGA resolution tablet with super slim bezel. We also added another new features to our\nTDDI that can support up to WUXGA and WQXGA resolution which has gained several design-wins from tablet\nOEMs across Korea and China in 2019. We also launched the first TDDI supporting active stylus function in tablets\nwhich commenced mass production and contributed to our tablet application business in early 2020. With the\ndemand increase for bigger size display, higher resolution, and precise touch accuracy and stylus performance,\nHimax kept developing new tablet TDDIs to broaden the company’s product lineup to maintain our leading market\nposition. We started mass production for the world’s first 12.4” WQXGA super high-resolution in-cell tablet PC\nwith a leading end customer in 2021 and expanded collaborations with more brands into more models in 2022.\nTablet in-cell TDDI offers the benefits of lower cost and a simplified supply chain that represents an easier\nmanufacturing process for panel makers. For consumers, it offers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish design\nas well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus. Our active stylus in-cell technology is\nadopted in many launched tablet products. At present, we are the dominant supplier for literally all leading Android\nnames. In 2020, tablet demand picked up significantly, fueled mainly by remote work and online learning demand\ndue to the pandemic. TDDI for tablet application continues to broaden its market and penetrate notebook PC\napplications, representing a potential upside for Himax into 2023 and beyond.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our products for smartphone and tablet applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD TDDI for smartphone and In-cell TDDI (Touch and Display Driver Integration) as a highly\n⚫\ntablet integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, gate driver,\npower circuit, timing controller and memory, touch sensor ADCs and\n33\nmicrocontroller\nMainstream smartphone single chip for HD+ (720RGB x Y pixels) or\n⚫\nFHD+ (1080RGB x Y pixels)\nMainstream tablet PC resolutions for WXGA (800RGB x Y) with\n⚫\nsingle chip or WUXGA (1200RGB x Y), WQXGA (1600RGB x Y)\nwith 2-chip cascaded\nConventional 60Hz and up to 144Hz new high frame rate solutions\n⚫\nSupport MIPI interface and VESA DSC\n⚫\nSupport up to 16 million colors\n⚫\nSupport active stylus for tablet PC\n⚫\nCOG and COF solutions for super slim bottom border\n⚫\nTFT-LCD Tablet Display Drivers highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, power\n⚫\ncircuit, and timing controller\nsuitable for a wide range of resolutions from WSVGA (600 x 1024),\n⚫\nWXGA (800 x 1280), WUXGA (1200x1920) to WQXGA (1600 x\n2560)\nsupport up to 16 million colors\n⚫\nsupport RGB separated gamma adjustment\n⚫\nsupport CABC\n⚫\nsupport color enhancement features\n⚫\nsupport MIPI interface\n⚫\ntouch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell\n⚫\ntouch display\nsupporting TDDI with active stylus\n⚫\nCOG and COF solutions for super slim bezel\n⚫\nAMOLED Solutions ASIC TCON and Driver IC chipset designed to meet customized\n⚫\nrequirements for tablet\nFlagship tablet resolutions WQXGA (1600RGB x Y) with multi-chip\n⚫\ncascaded, up to 3Kx2K resolution and 144Hz refresh rate\nSupport MIPI interface and VESA DSC with 1 billion colors (10bit\n⚫\ngrayscale)\nSmartphone single chip with sub-pixel rendering, Demura-IPs for\n⚫\nFHD+ resolution with up to 144Hz high frame rate\nSupport MIPI interface and VESA DSC with 1 billion colors (10bit\n⚫\ngrayscale)\nElectronic Paper Display Applications\nWe offer display driver for the Electronic Paper Display (EPD) applications, Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) and\nSignage Display.

The main products\nare Power Managements ICs (PMIC), Programmable Gamma OP ICs (PGOP) and Level Shifter ICs (LS). In recent\nyears, PMIC/PGOP 2-in-1 and PMIC/PGOP/LS 3-in-1 PMIC have gradually become the mainstream solutions.\nPower Management ICs\nA power management IC integrates several power components to fulfill system power requirements. It may\ninclude step-up or step-down pulse width modulation, or PWM, DC-to-DC converters, low-dropout regulators, or\nLDO regulators, voltage detectors, operational amplifiers, p-gamma OP, level shifters, and/or other components. For\npanel module applications, a power management IC provides a reliable and precise voltage for source drivers, gate\ndrivers, timing controllers, and panel cells. Moreover, its built-in over-temperature and over-current protections help\nprevent components from being damaged under certain abnormal conditions. As integrating an increasing number of\ncomponents into a power management IC is likely to be a continuing trend, we believe power management ICs will\ncontinue to be critical components of a TFT-LCD panel module.

The level shifter converts the timing-controller (TCON) logic-level signals\nto the high-level signals needed by the GOA (gate on array) display. The output circuitry has been designed to\nachieve high rise and fall times when driving the capacitive loads typically encountered in TFT-LCD display\napplications.\nProduct Features\n16- channel output level shifter for • Support 1 or 2 of T-con input signals\nGOA TFT-LCD • Support 1 or 2 input and 4/6/8/10 clock channel output\n• 2 channel STV\n• 2 channel LC\n• Reset function\n• OTP/ SCP and OCP function by I2C or Resistor adjustment\nLED driver\nA light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that is widely used in lighting, display and TFT\nLCD backlight nowadays. The advantages of LEDs as light sources are the small size, fast switching, low power\nconsumption and long lifetime etc.\nLED driver IC is designed to dim the LEDs with critical features such as high current accuracy, high current\nmatching, short LED protection, open LED protection, over voltage protection, ghosting effect reduction and current\nsink leakage protection etc.\nProduct Features\nCustomer ASIC • By Customer Specification\nCMOS Image Sensor Products\nThe CMOS image sensor products are developed by our subsidiary, Himax Imaging. The products were\ndesigned firstly for camera-equipped mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and notebook computers, with a\nfocus on low light image and video quality. Although it seems relatively challenging for us to gain significant\nmarket share in conventional RGB camera, we do think there are various interesting and different applications in\nimaging. Based on the technologies and IP we developed, on top of legacy products for laptop and multimedia we\nhave been supplying, our product lines have been expanded to cover three domains: ultralow power computer\nvision- Always-On Sensor (“AoS”), Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, and big pixel BSI sensors in automotive and\nsurveillance. In 2019, we further prioritized our focus on ultralow power computer vision- Always-On Sensor\n(“AoS”) as the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. Together\nwith the technologies we already developed, such as Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, we can provide our customers\nthe best integrated solutions for several specific domains.\nIn addition to advancing our AoS sensor to drive the power as low as possible, we also devote ourselves to\ndeveloping sensors that have industry leading small pixel (1.12um) with higher near infrared Quantum Efficiency\n(“QE”) to support the new generation cameras. Their superior performance hugely helps to reduce the system’s\npower consumption and therefore enhances the system performance. With the high QE in NIR band, we open the\ndoors to building more sensor and camera systems for machine vision. For example, our HM11B1 is a critical part\nof Himax’s WiseEye notebook solution, an AI-based ultralow power AI image sensing total solution and has\npenetrated into the laptop ecosystem for the most stylish super slim bezel design. Given its slim dimension\n(narrower than 2mm of the chip itself) to support ultra-thin bezel, we originally combine IR sensor to support\nWindows Hello, and then added intelligent AoS sensor into a single silicon. This 2-in-1 sensor not only enables new\nfeatures, but also greatly saves laptop makers’ effort in mechanical design and overall cost.\n38\nWe are committed to be a key player in the CMOS image sensor business with continuous investment in\nexperienced human resources, an efficient supply chain as well as strategic technology developments and\npartnerships to further increase the performance and improve features of small and specially designed pixel sensors.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our CMOS image sensor products:\nProduct Features\n4MP UltraSense 2 NIR Sensor 1/3”

This innovative\napproach enables wafer level optics to manufacture micro/nano optics structure and high temperature resistance,\nmaking the compatible Surface-Mount Technology or SMT reflow process possible. We offer entire optical\nsolutions for customers who need compact and easy-to-handle optical products on their electronic devices.\nCombining traditional optical lens design, precise mold control and semiconductor manufacturing expertise, our\nWLO lens with integrated waveguide, refractive optics and diffractive optical element (DOE) is one of the best\nsolutions for next generation computational imaging module for 2D/3D illumination and 3D dot projector, which\ncan be applied to 3D face recognition, 3D sensing, 3D reconstruction, and gesture control. Himax is a pioneer in\nhigh-precision diffraction optics technology with over 15 years of experience, having worked on very different\n40\ndesigns over a variety of applications with some of the world’s most heavyweight tech names. With the innovative\nprocess and specific structure, our wafer level optics products provide small form factor and compact module size to\nbe easily integrated into consumer products. The diffraction optics technology is now well adopted in 3D sensing,\nAR/VR devices, holographic display, automotive, biomedical inspection, optical communication, etc. We are seeing\nthat DOE plays an even more decisive role for the next generation optical technology in light of its high-precision\nand lightweight characteristics.\nOur WLO technology is also adapted to form microstructures such as lens array, DOE and lenticular lenses for\nadvanced applications in digital and computational imaging fields. These technologies stand in a unique position to\nintegral optical design, semiconductor manufacturing process, and compact packaging service, which are rarely\ncovered by one single company. Deeply rooted in core wafer level optics technologies, we provide highly\ncustomized optical solutions and high-volume manufacturing to many Tier-1 customers such as structured lighted\nand ToF 3D sensing on mobile devices, AR/VR gadgets, automotive, biomedical devices and many other AIoT\napplications.\nOur WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer.\nThe overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in\nmore models. In 2019, we continued the strong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill an anchor customer’s\nhigher demand with a significant year-over-year increase. We continued our shipment to an anchor customer for\ntheir legacy product and continue making progress on R&D projects with world-leading high-tech giants for ToF 3D\nsensing, AR/VR gadgets, automotive, biomedical devices and others, targeting their future generation products\ncentered around our exceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology. One\nillustration is our WLO technology being deployed by one VR player to empower 3D perception sensing for precise\ncontroller-free gesture recognition. We expect volume production starting in 2023.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our wafer level optics products:\nProduct Features\nRefractive Optical Lens for Micro Lens Array (MLA) illumination diffuser, lighting control,\n⚫\nflux illumination lens, collimation lens, and compact size camera\nlens\nprovide multi-layer solution including optical AR coating,\n⚫\nIR-cutting filter coating, aspheric surface\ndouble-side manufacture process\n⚫\nalready in mass production\n⚫\nDiffractive Optical Element (DOE) computational imaging, flux illumination, dot projector for 3D\n⚫\nsensing, 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\nusing WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE and refractive lens\n⚫\nprovide customized solution for specific application\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable component\n⚫\neye safety detect circuit embedded\n⚫\nDiffuser element for flood using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE technology\n⚫\nillumination and TOF the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n⚫\neye safety detect circuit embedded\n⚫\nNear Infrared (NIR) Projector dot projector module solution for computer vision, 3D sensing, 3D\n⚫\nModule reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\nintegral NIR Laser (830/850/940nm), optical system (refractive+\n⚫\ndiffractive lens) and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution to provide the smallest form factor\nmodule design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n⚫\nprovide customized module solution for different application\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable device\n⚫\nincluding active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n⚫\nFlood illumination Module provide customized solution for specific application integral NIR\n⚫\nLaser (830/850/940nm), and high precise active alignment assembly\n41\nsolution\nmodule design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n⚫\nthe smallest form factor and reflowable device\n⚫\nincluding active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n⚫\n3D Sensing Business\nWe continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing projects.\nIn 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing total solution targeting Android smartphone’s front-facing\napplication was unsuccessful due to the high hardware cost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time required\nto integrate it into the smartphone and the lack of killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and online\npayment. Instead of 3D sensing, most of the Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost fingerprint\ntechnology which can achieve similar phone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised\nuser experience.\nAs a leading provider of 3D sensing technology, Himax is also an active participant in smartphone OEMs’\ndesign projects for new devices involving ToF technology. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone\nmakers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D depth\ninformation generation for AR. Unlike structured light 3D sensing where we provide total solution or just projector\nmodule or optics depending on customers’ needs, with ToF, we will only focus on transmitter module or optics\ncomponent by leveraging our WLO related expertise. We continue to actively work with industry leading VCSEL\nproviders, sensor companies, module manufacturers and smartphone makers for a new and advanced ToF 3D\nsolution development, targeting Android smartphones. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we have provided our\npartners with spot projectors or optics components for their reference design.\n3D sensing can have a wide range of applications beyond smartphone. We have started to explore business\nopportunities in various industries by leveraging our structured light 3D sensing total solution. Starting in 2021, we\nshipped small volume of business access control and biomedical inspection devices with more design-ins and\nengagements currently under progress. To strengthen our offers in 3D sensing total solution, we have been\ncollaborating closely mainly with two types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial recognition\nalgorithm and those offering application processors with strong AI capability.\nOther than 3D sensing total solution, we also provide key component, including3D decoder IC and 3D vision\nprocessors. Our proprietary 3D decoder IC can accelerate local image processing for face recognition and offer\nbest-in-class security authentication, therefore it- is particularly suitable for customers who wish to design their own\nstructured light-based 3D sensing solution. It was already certified by the leading Chinese electronic payment\nstandard with requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation and strict privacy and now it’s well-adopted\nby many China e-payment solution providers. We entered into volume production of our proprietary 3D decoder IC\nin 2020, followed by meaningful volume shipments into 2021 and 2022. In the light of increasing adoption of 3D\nsensing technologies in various aspect of our daily life, a series of next generation 3D vision processors is also under\ndevelopment to support a variety of state-of-the-art 3D sensing technologies in Time of Flight (”ToF”) and\nstructured light, aiming to improve user experience when people interact with AR and VR applications.\nOur critical 3D sensing Technologies includes the following:\nWafer Level Optics Products\nWLO is one of the key technologies enabling 3D sensing, AR goggle devices, and many other applications.\nLevering on our exceptional design know-how and mass production experience in WLO technology, we are able to\nproduce the world’s most compact optics required for 3D sensing, while also achieving superior performance and\nlower costs.\nASIC\nOne of the critical elements of our 3D sensing total solution is an ASIC for 3D depth map generation. We are\nable to develop the ASIC thanks to our unique in-house capability in developing video ASICs for customers.\nEquipped with the ASIC, our 3D sensing total solution can substantially reduce the power consumed while\nprocessing 3D sensing, enhance personal data security, accelerate the 3D depth map generation, and provide\nsuperior depth data output that matches with our optical component. We consider this unique capability as our\n42\ncompetitive advantage. It has been and will continue to be one of our key drivers in the success of our 3D sensing\ntotal solution.\nActive Alignment\nWith much experience in optical assembly for AR and VR devices, our factory has developed a system to do\nactive alignment for tiny components. From the incoming quality check, assembly process, and testing, all steps are\nmonitored and checked. The precision assembly capability gives us a very good foundation to do the optical\nassembly for DOE, WLO, and laser.\nLaser Driver\nBased on our expertise in projector, optics, and driver, we have designed a special Glass Broken Detection\n(“GBD”) mechanism on our projector. We also have a proprietary laser driver design that detect the connection of\nthe GBD on the projector. When GBD connection is abnormal, which means glass was broken, the laser driver can\ncease the laser to prevent users from being exposed to higher power laser energy leaking from the broken glass.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our SLiM 3D sensing solutions:\nProduct Features\nSLiM 3D sensing total solution Dot projector: More than 33,000 invisible dots, the highest in the\n⚫\nindustry, projected onto object to build the most sophisticated 3D\ndepth map among all structured light solutions\nDepth map accuracy: Error rate of < 0.5% within the entire\n⚫\noperation range of 30cm-100cm\nFace recognition: Enabled by the most sophisticated 3D depth data\n⚫\nto build unique facial map that can be used for instant unlock and\nsecure online payment\nIndoor/outdoor sensitivity: Superior sensing capability even under\n⚫\ntotal darkness or bright sunlight\nEye safety: Certified for IEC 60825 Class 1, the international laser\n⚫\nproduct standard which governs laser product safety under all\nconditions of normal use with naked eyes\nGlass broken detection: Patented glass broken detection mechanism\n⚫\nin the dot projector whereby laser is shut down instantaneously in\nthe event of broken glass in the projector\nPower consumption: Less than 400mW for projector, sensor and\n⚫\ndepth decoding combined, making it the lowest power consuming\n3D sensing device by far among all structured light solutions\nModule size: the smallest structured light solution in the market,\n⚫\nideal for embedded and mobile device integration\nHV-II 3D Decoder ASIC Himax 3D Depth Processor with high depth accuracy\n⚫\nSupport up to HD resolution depth map for different applications\n⚫\n2D & 3D auto-exposure control for projector and sensor\n⚫\nFrame rate conversion for different application/capability of SOC\n⚫\nScaling engine for different application/capability of SOC\n⚫\nAmbient light detection and removal\n⚫\nEmbedded Security Engine\n⚫\nPower Management Engine for power shutdown\n⚫\nMIPI CSI-2 / DPHY interface\n⚫\nUltralow power WiseEye Smart Image Sensing\nThe demand for always-on battery-powered smart devices with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. By\ncombining an ultralow power image sensor with a custom computer vision ASIC and machine-learning algorithms,\nHimax ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing solution enriches connected edge devices with AI capability.\n43\nThe end-point AI system, which consumes only a few mW power consumptions, is leading the industry for the\nnext-generation of battery operated, clever computer vision applications. The ultralow power WiseEye smart image\nsensing solution is being engaged in a variety of applications, such as notebook, home appliances, utility meter,\nautomotive, battery-powered surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing, and medical, just to name a few.\nAmong Himax’s ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing businesses, our WiseEye for notebook solution\nfeatures human presence detection and on-looker detection, offering power saving and enhancing privacy and\nsecurity for notebook users. In 2021, we were highly encouraged by our WiseEye notebook solution being officially\nawarded by Dell, with a sizable purchase order, for a series of their new models. This represented a remarkable\nachievement and an illustration of the robustness of our AI solution. In 2022, we continue to support the mass\nproduction of Dell’s notebook and other end-point AI applications, such as shared bike parking, video conference\ndevice, door lock and medical capsule endoscope and many others. We expect to see more design-wins awarded\nacross a broad customer base and a high variety of applications leading to robust sales growth for this new high\nmargin product line moving forward.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing total solutions:\nProduct Features\nWiseEyeTM AI total solution The total solution incorporates Himax proprietary ultralow power\n⚫\nWiseEye AI processor, always-on CMOS image sensor, and\nCNN-based computer vision AI algorithm, featuring tinyML AI in\ntiny form factor, ultralow power consumption, low latency, privacy\nprotection and optimized cost.\nTotal solution supports use of a variety of Himax CMOS image\n⚫\nsensors –HM11B1 RGB/IR/AI hybrid sensor.

WE1 is especially suitable for\nresource-constrained and battery powered context-aware\napplication, such as motion detection, human detection and face\ndetection.\nComputer vision algorithm is based on tiny machine learning\n⚫\nframework, which is trainable for desired use cases (human\npresence detection, attention detection and on-looker detection for\nnotebook applications; occupancy detection, gesture recognition etc.\nfor AIoT applications) on ultralow power and resource-constrained\ncompute platform (CPU clock, internal memory)\nFor the other business model, we provide key components, such as proprietary ultralow power WE1 AI\nprocessor or Always-On CMOS image sensor (AoS). For our key component business model, we reinforced our\ngo-to-market strategy by intensively participating in leading AI partners’ infrastructures and ecosystems and/or AI\ncommunities. The Company collaborates with world-leading edge-to-cloud service providers and system integration\ncompanies, such as Google TensorFlow, Microsoft Azure, Arm AI Partner Program, tinyML Foundation, Seeed\nStudio and many others, to enjoy the enormous network of these ecosystems partners and their numerous\nparticipants to drive further adoption on applications such as smart home/ office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and\nmany other applications. Additionally, we continued our marketing efforts through joint webinars and other online\nactivities with several well-known platform partners such as Edge Impulse, Digi-Key and SparkFun. We continue to\nreceive inquiries from large corporations and individual developers alike with hundreds of evaluation boards and\ndevelopments kits having been purchased online and distributed across the globe. We are very encouraged by the\ntraction this relatively new product line has generated in a short amount of time and expect to see increasing sales\ncontribution through 2023 and beyond.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our WE1 AI Processor product:\nProduct Features\nWE1 AI Processor Ultralow power consumption: 40 uW/MHz\n⚫\nSupport image, voice trigger simultaneously to wake up system\n⚫\n44\nOptimized multi-layer power states for always-on applications\n⚫\nReady-for- use software package and Machine Learning Library,\n⚫\nincluding device driver, SDK and embARC Machine Learning\nInference Library to support Google TensorFlow Lite Micro\nframework\nARC-EM9D 32-bit DSP: Frequency up to 400MHz,\n⚫\nMemory: Up to 2MByte SRAM\n⚫\nHigh performance pixel processing accelerator and JPEG codec\n⚫\nSecurity Engine: Support secure boot, secure FW update, secure\n⚫\ndebug mode, Support AES 128bits, RSA 2048bits, Hash-256,\nTRNG, Secure key management\nPeripheral: 1/4/8-bit camera interface, I2C/SPI master/slave,\n⚫\nUART, PWM, GPIO with 5 wake-up pins, 12-bit ADC with 4\nchannels, up to 1Msps, RTC Timer\nAlso support image pre-rolling feature for better security offering.\n⚫\nCore Technologies and Know-How\nDriving System Technology. Through our collaboration with panel manufacturers, we have developed\nextensive knowledge of circuit design, TFT-LCD/AMOLED driving systems, high-voltage CMOS processes and\ndisplay systems, all of which are important to the design of high-performance TFT-LCD/AMOLED display drivers.\nOur engineers have in-depth knowledge of the driving system technology, which is the architecture for the\ninteraction between the source driver, gate driver, timing controller and power systems as well as other passive\ncomponents. We believe that our understanding of the entire driving system has strengthened our design capabilities.\nOur engineers are highly skilled in designing power efficient and compact display drivers that enhance the\nperformance of TFT-LCD/AMOLED. We are leveraging our know-how of display drivers and driving system\ntechnology to develop display drivers for panels utilizing other technologies such as next generation AMOLED and\nelectronic paper displays.\nHigh-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design. Unlike most other semiconductors, TFT-LCD display drivers require a\nhigh output voltage of 3.3 to 50 volts. We have developed circuit design technologies using a high-voltage CMOS\nprocess that enables us to produce high-yield, reliable and compact drivers for high-volume applications. Moreover,\nour technologies enable us to keep the driving voltage at very high uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve\nwhen using standard CMOS process technology.\nHigh-Bandwidth Interfaces. In addition to high-voltage circuit design, TFT-LCD display drivers require high\nbandwidth transmission for video signals. We have applied several high-speed interfaces, including\ntransistor-transistor logic (“TTL”), Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), mini low-voltage differential\nsignaling (“LVDS”), dual-edge TTL (“DETTL”), turbo Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), Mobile\nIndustry Processor Interface (“MIPI”) and other customized interfaces in our display drivers. Moreover, we are\ndeveloping additional driver interfaces for special applications with optimized speed, lower EMI and higher system\nstability.\nDie Shrink and Low Power Technologies. Our engineers are highly skilled in employing their knowledge of\ndriving technology and high-voltage CMOS circuit design to shrink the die size of our display drivers while\nleveraging their understanding of driving technology and panel characteristics to design display drivers with low\npower consumption. Die size is an important consideration for applications with size constraints. Smaller die size\nalso reduces the cost of the chip. Lower power consumption is important for many portable devices such as\nnotebook computers, smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products.\nWiseEye Smart Image Sensing Technologies. These technologies are composed by an AoS sensor, an edge AI\nASIC processor and computer-vision AI algorithm, all operated in ultralow power mode. Our industrial first AoS\nCMOS image sensor features ultralow power and low latency back-illuminated solution for always on, intelligent\nvisual sensing applications. With Himax’s exceptional low power know-how and ASIC implementation\ntechnologies, our WiseEye AI image processor featured different power domain and mode management schemes,\ntogether with advanced image processing hardwired accelerators to construct different operating modes in balancing\nprocessor performance and power consumptions. The seamless and proprietary interface between our AoS sensor\nand AI processor ensure the efficient and fast-response sensor data transmission and wake-up mechanism operating\n45\nin ultralow power mode. The computer-vision AI algorithm, which benefits from high performance and low power\nAI processor and image data from sensor, can therefore enable AI features such as powerful human detection,\noccupancy detection and motion classification for various application needs.\nLCoS Microdisplay Technologies. Compared to other microdisplay technologies, LCoS microdisplay offers\nsmaller form factor, higher brightness, and less power consumption. Himax Display has own proficient engineering\nteam to develop patented industry-only non-captive LCoS, front-lit waveguide, and module design, along with an\nin-house ISO certified manufacture line, all of which positions us at the forefronts of leading AR glasses and\nAR-HUD markets. The latest development of Front-Lit LCoS enables an ultra-compact and extremely\npower-efficient optical engine by consolidating and integrating LED illumination system into the micro display\nmodule itself and makes the patented technology ideal for AR headsets. Furthermore, Himax Display provided\nphase modulation LCoS 2.0 technologies to offer high-efficient, low power and multi-focal plane displaying features\nto fit for holographic displaying needs in numerous leading applications.\n3D Technologies. Several technologies in Himax are integrated together to form our 3D solution. First, wafer\nlevel nanoimprinted technology is used to design and manufacture DOE and Waveguide. Then, our in-house\ncapability on semiconductors enables us to design IC that particularly matches our optical component. Our expertise\nin precision assembly in optics also helps us to provide a more complete solution to our customers.\nCustomers\nOur customers for display drivers are primarily panel manufacturers and mobile device module manufacturers,\nwho in turn design and market their products to manufacturers of end-use products such as notebook computers,\ndesktop monitors, televisions, smartphone, tablet, automotive and consumer electronics products. We may sell our\nproducts through agents or distributors for certain products or in certain regions. As of December 31, 2022, we sold\nour products to more than 200 customers. Our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 77.7%,\n79.5% and 76.7% of our revenues in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, our two largest\ncustomers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue: customer A and its affiliates accounted for 32.6%, 32.1%\nand 32.3% of our revenues, respectively; and customer C accounted for 12.7%, 19.1% and 9.4%, respectively.\nCertain of our customers provide us with a long-term (twelve-month) forecast plus three-month rolling\nnon-binding forecasts and confirm orders about one month ahead of scheduled delivery. In general, purchase orders\nare not cancellable by either party, although from time to time we and our customers have agreed to amend the terms\nof such orders.\nSales and Marketing\nWe focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology relationships principally\nwith panel manufacturers, using LTPS and a-Si TFT-LCD, and OLED technologies, mobile display module and\nmobile device manufacturers for smartphone, tablet and automotive, and camera module houses in order to work\nclosely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product road maps. Our engineers\ncollaborate with our customers’ engineers to create products that comply with their specifications and provide a high\nlevel of performance at competitive prices and also create customized features for end brand customers. Our end\nmarket for large-sized panels is concentrated among a limited number of major panel manufacturers. We also market\nour products directly to TV, monitor, notebook and mobile, tablet and automotive device manufacturers so that our\nproducts can be qualified for their specifications and designed into their products. Furthermore, we extend our\nbusiness development with system and ODM companies by using strategic ASIC business model to not only\ndevelop ASIC product based on customer specification but also jointly research and develop new technologies to\nmeet customers' future product demand. Additionally, we form strategic partnership with Tier 1 customers for our\nLCoS microdisplays, 3D sensing and WiseEye smart image sensing to penetrate into the emerging market. We\nbelieve we need close alliance with our customers to build up ecosystem for new applications.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales teams located in Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.\nWe also have dedicated sales teams for certain of our most important current or prospective customers. We have\noffices in Tainan, Hsinchu, Taipei, Taiwan; and Shenzen and Suzhou, China. We have other sales and technical\nsupport offices in Hefei, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Foshan, Fuqing, Ningbo, Wuhan, Nanjing, Chongqing,\nChengdu, Xi’an and Xiamen, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South Korea, Munich, Germany; and\nIrvine and San Jose, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, all in close proximity to our customers. For\ncertain products or regions, we may sell our products through agents or distributors.\n46\nOur sales and marketing team possesses a high level of technical expertise and industry knowledge used to\nsupport a lengthy and complex sales process. This includes a highly trained team of product managers and field\napplications engineers. Our team is equipped with extensive strategic marketing experience and a strong capability\nto identify market trends. We also provide technical support and assistance to potential and existing customers in\nsystem/SoC architecture, designing, testing and qualifying display modules, camera modules and end application\nsystems that incorporate our products and ASICs. We believe that the depth and quality of this design support are\nkey to improving customers’ time-to-market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.\nManufacturing\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely on semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication, gold bumping,\nassembly and testing. We also rely largely on third-party suppliers of processed tape used in TAB packaging. We\nengage foundries with high-voltage CMOS process technology for our display drivers and engage assembly and\ntesting houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages, thereby taking advantage of the economies of scale and\nthe specialization of such semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to\ncapture certain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures,\nfixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the\nmost suitable for any given product.\nWe operate a fab under Himax Display primarily for performing manufacturing processes for our LCoS\nmicrodisplays. Moreover, for better integration, we also established an in-house color filter facility under Himax\nTaiwan, which commenced shipments from 2010. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our\nproprietary single-panel color LCoS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness of\nour LCoS products and creates value for our customers. In addition, we have established an in-house WLO facility\nunder Himax Taiwan for the key process of our wafer level optics products, which started small-scale shipments\nfrom December 2009 and commenced mass shipment to anchor customer from 2017 onwards. We began\nconstruction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the current headquarters to house additional\nWLO capacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our 3D sensing business and to provide extra office\nspace. The construction of Fab 2 was completed in the first half of 2018.\nManufacturing Stages\nThe diagram below sets forth the various stages in manufacturing display drivers according to the two different\ntypes of assembly utilized: TAB or COG. The assembly type depends primarily on the application and design of the\n47\npanel and is determined by our customers.\n48\nT aP p e Ca\nc k a(T\nC\nP\nagP\nro c\nrriein\ng)\ne s\nr\ns e d T a p e\nC hF(C ip oilmO\nF\nn\n)\nT A B\nIn n e r-le aB\no n d in g\nF in a lT\ne s tin g\nd\nW a fe r F a b ric a tio n\nG o ld B u m p in g\nC h ip P ro b e T e s tin g\nC O G\nW a fe r F a b ric a tio n\nG o ld B u m p in g\nC h ip P ro b e T e s tin g\nC O G A s s e m b ly a n dT\ne s tin g\nWafer Fabrication: Based on our design, the foundry provides us with fabricated wafers. Each fabricated wafer\ncontains many chips, each known as a die.\nGold Bumping: After the wafers are fabricated, they are delivered to gold bumping houses where gold bumps\nare plated on each wafer. The gold bumping process uses thin film metal deposition, photolithography and electrical\nplating technologies. The gold bumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die to the processed tape, in the case\nof TAB package, or the glass, in the case of COG package.\nChip Probe Testing: Each die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded.\nAssembly and Testing: Our display drivers use two types of assembly technology: TAB or COG. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and to a lesser extent COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products typically require COG package\ntypes.\nTAB Assembly\nWe use two types of TAB technologies: TCP and COF. TCP and COF packages are both made of processed\ntape that is typically 35mm or 48mm wide, plated with copper foil and has a circuit formed within it. TCP and COF\npackages differ, however, in terms of their chip connections. With TCP packages, a hole is punched through the\nprocessed tape in the area of the chip, which is connected to a flying lead made of copper. By contrast, with COF\npackages, the lead is mounted directly on the processed tape and there is no flying lead. In recent years, COF\npackages have become predominantly used in TAB technology.\nInner-Lead Bonding: The TCP and COF assembly process involves grinding the bumped wafers into their\n⚫\nrequired thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies, or chips. An inner lead bonder machine\nconnects the chip to the printed circuit processed tape and the package is sealed with resin at high\ntemperatures.\nFinal Testing: The assembled display drivers are tested to ensure that they meet performance specifications.\n⚫\nTesting takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each product.\nCOG Assembly\nCOG assembly connects display drivers directly to LCD panels without the need for processed tape. COG\nassembly involves grinding the tested wafers into their required thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies,\nor chips. Each individual die is picked and placed into a chip tray and is then visually or auto-inspected for defects.\nThe dies are packed within a tray in an aluminum bag after completion of the inspection process.\nQuality Assurance\nWe maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system. Using a variety of methods, from conducting rigorous\nsimulations during the circuit design process to evaluating supplier performance at various stages of our products’\nmanufacturing process, we seek to bring about improvements and achieve customer satisfaction. In addition to\nmonitoring customer satisfaction through regular reviews, we implement extensive supplier quality controls so that\nthe products we outsource achieve our high standards. Prior to engaging a third party as our supplier, we perform a\nseries of audits on their operations, and upon engagement, we hold frequent quality assurance meetings with our\nsuppliers to evaluate such factors as product quality, production costs, technological sophistication and timely\ndelivery.\nIn November 2002, we received ISO 9001 certification, which was renewed in March 2021 and will expire in\nMarch 2024. In February 2006, we received ISO 14001 certification, which was renewed in December 2020 and\nwill expire in December 2023. In addition, in March 2007, we received IECQ QC 080000 certification, which was\nrenewed in February 2022 and will expire in March 2025.\nEnvironmental Management System and Safety and Health Management System\nHimax follows closely the global environmental trends, including energy saving and waste reduction, in its\ndaily operations. The Company is certified in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14064.\nHimax is a leader in its sector when it comes to the environment and safety, operating under measures much\nmore stringent than domestic regulations. The Company aims to grow sustainably, delivering economic, social and\nenvironmental benefits with its healthy employees.\nHimax has also been tirelessly reducing impacts to the environment and improving safety in its operations,\nspecifically targeting product design and waste handling.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Service Providers and Suppliers\nThrough our relationships with leading foundries, assembly, gold bumping and testing houses and processed\ntape suppliers, we believe we have established a supply chain that enables us to deliver high-quality products to our\ncustomers in a timely manner.\nAccess to semiconductor manufacturing service providers is critical as display drivers require high-voltage\nCMOS process technology and specialized assembly and testing services, all of which are different from industry\nstandards. We have obtained our foundry services from TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, Macronix, Globalfoundries\nSingapore, PSMC, Nexchip and SKHYSI in the past few years. These are among a select number of semiconductor\nmanufacturers that provide high-voltage CMOS process technology required for manufacturing display drivers. We\nengage assembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages such as Chipbond, Chipmore\nInternational trading company Ltd., ChipMOS Technologies Inc., Nepes Corporation and King Yuan Electronics\nCo., Ltd, etc.\nWe plan to strengthen our relationships with our existing semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\ndiversify our network of such service providers in order to ensure access to sufficient cost-competitive and\n49\nhigh-quality manufacturing capacity. We are selective in our choice of semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. It takes a substantial amount of time to qualify alternative foundries, gold bumping, assembly and testing\nhouses for production. As a result, we expect that we will continue to rely on a limited number of semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers for a substantial portion of our manufacturing requirements in the near future.\nThe table below sets forth (in alphabetical order) our principal semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nand suppliers:\nWafer Fabrication Gold Bumping\nGlobalfoundries Singapore Pte., Ltd.

We have also expanded certain facilities for LCoS and WLO products\nto accommodate new customers and new applications located at our headquarters in Tainan, Taiwan. In addition,\nHimax Taiwan owns and operates a fab with 1,431 square meters of floor space in a building leased from Innolux in\nTainan, where it established an in-house color filter facility that commenced shipments from 2010. This in-house\nfacility provides color filter for CMOS image sensor and LCoS products. The color filter line is a critical and unique\nprocess for our proprietary single-panel color LCoS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the\ncompetitiveness of our color-filter LCoS microdisplays products and creates value for our customers.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and\ntheir accompanying notes included elsewhere herein which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n5.A. Operating Results\nFor discussion related to our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and the results of operations for\n2021 compared to 2020, refer to “Part I, Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,” in our Annual\nReport on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the United States Securities\nand Exchange Commission on March 23, 2022.\nOverview\nWe commenced operations through our predecessor, Himax Taiwan, in June 2001. We must, among other\nthings, continue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product portfolio, maintain our leading\ntechnology position, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate declining average\nselling prices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover, we must continue to\naddress the challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and retaining managerial,\nengineering, operational and financial personnel and implementing and improving our existing administrative,\nfinancial and operations systems.\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication,\ngold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCoS microdisplay, wafer level optics\nproducts and active alignment for 3D sensing, which we manufacture through our own factories. We are able to take\nadvantage of the economies of scale and the specialization of our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture certain financial and operational benefits, including\nreduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to\nuse the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given product. For LCoS microdisplay\nand wafer level optics products, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies and\nmanufacturing expertise in the effort to further expand these businesses.\nAs our semiconductors are critical components of flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the trends\nand developments of the flat panel display industry, in particular, the TFT-LCD panel segment. The majority of our\nrevenues in 2022 were derived from sales of display drivers that were eventually incorporated into TFT-LCD panels.\n54\nWe expect display drivers for TFT-LCD panels to continue to be our primary products. The TFT-LCD panel\nindustry is intensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of\nTFT-LCD panels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in downward pricing pressure on\nour products. See “Item 3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Condition and\nBusiness—We derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly\ncyclical and subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our\nbusiness or results of operations.” The revenue expansion of our non-driver products as well as TFT-LCD product\ntrending toward high resolution and any other new product introduction help to mitigate these risks.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur business, financial position and results of operations, as well as the period-to-period comparability of our\nfinancial results, are significantly affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\naverage selling prices;\n⚫\nunit shipments;\n⚫\nproduct mix;\n⚫\ndesign wins;\n⚫\ncost of revenues and cost reductions;\n⚫\nsupply chain management;\n⚫\nshare-based compensation expenses and cash awards; and\n⚫\ntax credits.\n⚫\nAverage Selling Prices\nOur performance is affected by the selling prices of each of our products. We price our products based on\nseveral factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage of the product, competition, technical complexity of\nthe product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer. We typically are able to charge the\nhighest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are able to raise our selling\nprices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline over a product’s life cycle,\nwhich may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such as constraints in foundry capacity.\nFor example, from 2020, the industry-wide tightening of foundry capacity has extended to backend facilities that\ninclude assembly and testing and appears to be a long-term phenomenon. Robust demand pushed foundry capacity\nconstraints to a more severe level and rose higher material cost which in turn enabled higher average selling prices.\nHowever, decades-high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates in addition to the ongoing war and unexpected\nlockdowns from Covid-19 in China starting from the end of first quarter of 2022, brought widespread demand halt,\nresulting in sluggish demand across every aspect of our business, followed by sales declined and average selling\nprice erosion. The general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling prices of semiconductors to\ndecline over a product’s life cycle due to competition, production efficiencies, emergence of substitutes and\ntechnological obsolescence. Our cost reduction efforts also contribute to this decline in average selling prices. See\n“—Cost of Revenues and Cost Reductions.”\nOur average selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. As new China panel\nmakers emerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their capacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will\nincrease accordingly, negatively impacting our average selling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by\nthe packaging type our customers choose as well as the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below.\nLastly, competition level affects our average selling prices as well. However, the impact of declining average selling\nprices on our profitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent by increased volume as lower prices may\nstimulate demand and thereby drive sales and TFT-LCD panel products trending toward higher resolution.\n55\nUnit Shipments\nOur performance is also affected by the number of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As our display\ndrivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our unit shipments depend primarily on our customers’ panel\nshipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since our inception primarily as a result of our\nincreased market share with certain major customers and their increased shipments of panels. Our growth in unit\nshipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels which typically require more display drivers.\nHowever, the development of higher channel display drivers or new technologies, if successful, could potentially\nreduce the number of display drivers required for each panel while achieving the same resolution. If such\ntechnologies become commercially available, the market for our display drivers will be reduced and we could\nexperience a decline in revenue and profit. Our unit shipments also depend on the capacity we can get from our\nfoundry, assembly and testing house.\nProduct Mix\nThe proportion of our revenues that is generated from the sale of different product types, also referred to as\nproduct mix, also affects our average selling prices, revenues and profitability. Our display driver products vary\ndepending on, among other things, the number of output channels, the level of integration and the package type.\nVariations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices of such products. For example, the\ntrend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products with a higher number of channels, which\ntypically command higher average selling prices than traditional products with a lower number of channels.\nHowever, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically require fewer display drivers per panel. As a result,\nour profitability will be adversely affected to the extent that the decrease in the number of display drivers required\nfor each panel is not offset by increased total unit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers\nwith a higher number of channels. The level of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices,\nas more highly integrated chips typically have higher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected\nby changes in the package types used by our customers. For example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has\nlower material costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover, our different non-driver products vary in\naverage selling prices and costs.\nThe proportion of non-driver business would also affect our financial position and results of operations. For the\npast few years, we have experienced operating losses from our non-driver business. This was partly due to low sales\nvolume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to fully cover expenses such as research and\ndevelopment and operating expenses. We expect, however, to ramp up the volume production and sales of our\nnon-driver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-driver products. Typically,\nour non-driver products have higher gross margins as well as higher growth potential than our driver products, we\nexpect the overall profit margin across our product platform to improve.\nDesign Wins\nAchieving design wins is important to our business, and it affects our unit shipments. Design wins occur when a\ncustomer incorporates our products into their product designs. There are numerous opportunities for design wins,\nincluding, but not limited to, when panel manufacturers:\nintroduce new models to improve the cost and/or performance of their existing products or to expand their\n⚫\nproduct portfolio;\nestablish new fabs and seek to qualify existing or new component suppliers; and\n⚫\nreplace existing display driver companies due to cost or performance reasons.\n⚫\nDesign wins are not binding commitments by customers to purchase our products. However, we believe that\nachieving design wins is an important performance indicator. Our customers typically devote substantial time and\nresources to designing their products as well as qualifying their component suppliers and their products. Once our\nproducts have been designed into a system, the customer may be reluctant to change its component suppliers due to\nthe significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier or a replacement component. Therefore, we\nstrive to work closely with current and prospective customers in order to anticipate their requirements and product\nroadmaps and achieve additional design wins.\n56\nCost of Revenues and Cost Reductions\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2020, 2021\nand 2022 was 75.1%, 51.6% and 59.5%, respectively. In 2022, as a percentage of Himax Taiwan’s total\nmanufacturing costs, the cost of wafer fabrication was 63.0%, the cost of processed tape was 5.9%, the cost of\nassembly and testing was 30.3%, and overhead was 0.8%. Our cost of revenues may increase as a result of an\nincrease in raw material prices, any failure to obtain sufficient foundry, assembly or testing capacity or any shortage\nof processed tape or failure to improve our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield. As a result, our ability\nto manage our wafer fabrication costs, costs for processed tape, assembly and testing costs and our manufacturing\nutilization rate or production yield is critical to our performance. In addition, to mitigate declining average selling\nprices, we aim to reduce unit costs by, among other things:\nimproving product design (e.g., having smaller die size allows for a larger number of dies on each wafer,\n⚫\nthereby reducing the cost of each die);\nimproving manufacturing yields through our close collaboration with our semiconductor manufacturing\n⚫\nservice providers and in our in-house manufacturing facilities; and\nachieving better pricing from a diversified pool of semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\n⚫\nsuppliers, reflecting our ability to leverage our scale, volume requirements and close relationships as well\nas our strategy of sourcing from multiple service providers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Management\nDue to the competitive nature of the flat panel display industry and our customers’ need to maintain high\ncapacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs per panel, any delays in the delivery of our products could\nsignificantly disrupt our customers’ operations. To deliver our products on a timely basis and meet the quality\nstandards and technical specifications our customers require, we must have assurances of high-quality capacity from\nour semiconductor manufacturing service providers. We therefore strive to manage our supply chain by maintaining\nclose relationships with our key semiconductor manufacturing service providers and strive to provide credible\nforecasts of capacity demand and seek for new manufacturing service providers in case of any manufacturer’s\ncapacity shortage. Any disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our performance and could result in a\nloss of customers as well as potentially damage our reputation.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses and Cash Awards\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be\naffected by, our share-based compensation expenses and cash awards, which consist of charges taken relating to\ngrants of mainly RSUs as well as stock options, non-vested shares, and cash awards to employees.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs). We adopted two long-term incentive plans in October 2005 and September 2011,\nrespectively, which permit the grant of options or RSUs to our employees and non-employees where each unit\nrepresents two ordinary shares. The actual awards will be determined by our compensation committee. The 2005\nplan was terminated in October 2010. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding RSUs under the\nlong-term incentive plan totaling $4.8 million, $23.8 million and $20 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nOf the total share-based compensation expenses recognized, $4.8 million, $23.2 million and $17.5 million in 2020,\n2021 and 2022, respectively, were settled in cash. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all\nshare-based payments at fair value.\nSet forth below is a summary of our historical share-based compensation plans for the years ended December\n31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. However, we did not grant RSUs in\n2019 but granted stock options to employees instead.\nWe made grants of 580,235 RSUs to our employees on September 29, 2017. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 96.91% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $6.1\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 97.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $3.8\n57\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,402,714 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2020. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 98.68% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$4.8 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 2,604,545 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2021. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 85.63% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$23.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 3,987,509 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2022. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 86.41% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$17.5 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2023, 2024 and 2025,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nThe amount of share-based compensation expense with regard to the RSUs granted to our employees on\nSeptember 29, 2017, September 26, 2018, September 28, 2020, September 28, 2021 and September 28, 2022 was\n$10.93 per ADS, $5.76 per ADS, $3.44 per ADS, $10.39 per ADS, and $5.09 per ADS, respectively, which was\nbased on the trading price of our ADSs on that day.\nEmployee stock options. We made grants of 2,226,690 units of stock option to purchase 2,226,690 units ADS to\ncertain employees at an exercise price of $2.27 on September 30, 2019. The vesting schedule was that 50% of the\noptions vest half year after the date of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant. During\n2020, 114,500 units, 39,000 units and 10,000 units of stock option to purchase 114,500 units, 39,000 units and\n10,000 units ADS were grant to certain employees at an exercise price of $2.74, $3.9 and $3.35 on March 31, 2020,\nAugust 11, 2020 and September 25, 2020, respectively. The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1,\n2020. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding stock options under the long-term incentive\nplan totaling $0.7 million in 2020.\nCash Awards. We made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million and $19.3 million to the\nCompany’s employees among which $1.6 million and $1.0 million was immediately vested on September 28, 2021\nand September 28, 2022, respectively. The remainder will be equally vested at the first, second and third\nanniversaries of the grant date.\nTax Credits\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be\naffected by, tax credits available to us.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and development\nexpenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15% of the total qualifying\nresearch and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for the\ncurrent year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for Industrial Innovation may not be\ncarried forward.\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended\nto December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10% of\nthe total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the\nincome tax payable for each year.\nDescription of Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items\nRevenues\nHistorically, we generated majority of revenues from sales of display drivers for large-sized applications and\nsmall and medium-sized applications. In addition, our product portfolio also includes timing controllers, operational\n58\namplifiers, LCoS microdisplay, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors, 3D sensing, ultralow power\nWiseEye smart image sensing, wafer level optics products and ASIC service.\nThe 2022 full year revenues totaled $1.2 billion, representing a 22.3% decline compared to 2021. Unexpected\nlockdowns in China, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic related factors created a challenging operating\nenvironment and impaired our business performance for the year. The halt in consumer demand and significantly\nreduced visibility at panel houses and OEMs towards the end of the first quarter of 2022 adversely impacted IC\ndemand and consequently our sales.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenues by amount and our revenues as a\npercentage of revenues by each product line:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nDisplay drivers for large-sized\napplications ............................................$.. .2..4..0..,.7 89 2 7 .1 $ 397,905 25.7 $263,992 22.0\nDisplay drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications ........................5..1..5..,.7 33 58.1 963,537 62.3 778,946 64.8\nNon-driver products(1) ...................................1..3..0..,.7 60 14.8 185,655 12.0 158,401 13.2\nTotal .............................................................$..8..8..7.., 2 82 100.0 $1,547,097 100.0 $1,201,339 100.0\nNote: (1) Includes, among other things, timing controllers, LCoS projector solutions, power management IC,\nCMOS image sensors, programmable gamma OP, wafer level optics (WLO) products, ultralow power\nWiseEye smart image sensing, NRE incomes, and ASIC service.\nA limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues. For example, Customer A and its\naffiliates accounted for 32.6%, 32.1% and 32.3% of our revenues in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Customer C\naccounted for 12.7%, 19.1% and 9.4% of our revenues in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCustomer A and its affiliates ............................$.. .2. 89,663 32.6 $ 497,083 32.1 $ 388,194 32.3\nCustomer C .........................................................1. 12,504 12.7 295,217 19.1 113,396 9.4\nOthers ..................................................................4. 85,115 54.7 754,797 48.8 699,749 58.3\nTotal $ 887,282 100.0 $1,547,097 100.0 $1,201,339 100.0\nThe global TFT-LCD panel market is highly concentrated, with only a limited number of TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers producing large-sized TFT-LCD panels in high volumes. We sell large-sized panel display drivers to\nmany of these TFT-LCD panel manufacturers. Our revenues, therefore, will depend on our ability to capture an\nincreasingly larger percentage of each panel manufacturer’s display driver requirements. The sales to panel makers\nin China have become a significant portion of our revenue due to the Chinese panel maker business expansion which\nstarted in 2011. We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales to Asia-based customers whose end products\nare sold worldwide. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, approximately 13.9%, 14.2% and 14.6% of our revenues, respectively,\nwere from customers headquartered in Taiwan and approximately 79.7%, 81.5% and 77.0% of our revenues,\nrespectively, were from customers headquartered in China. We believe that substantially all of our revenues will\ncontinue to be from customers located in Asia, where almost all of the TFT-LCD panel manufacturers and mobile\ndevice module manufacturers are located. As a result of the regional customer concentration, we expect to continue\n59\nto be subject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in Asia. A\nsubstantial majority of our sales invoices are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of revenues, research and development expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses, share-based compensation expenses and cash awards. Costs\nwould be greatly affected by product mix.\nCost of Revenues\nThe principal items of our cost of revenues are:\ncost of wafer fabrication;\n⚫\ncost of processed tape used in TAB packaging;\n⚫\ncost of gold bumping, assembly and testing; and\n⚫\nother costs and expenses.\n⚫\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductors and semiconductor solutions to semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers. The costs of wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing depend on the\navailability of capacity and demand for such services. The wafer fabrication industry, in particular, is highly cyclical,\nresulting in fluctuations in the price of processed wafers depending on the available foundry capacity and the\ndemand for foundry services.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of research and development employee salaries,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, costs associated with prototype wafers, processed tape, masks, molding\nand tooling sets and depreciation on research and development equipment. We expect to continue increasing our\nspending on research and development in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue to increase our\nresearch and development headcount and associated costs to pursue additional product development opportunities.\nAs a percentage of revenues, our research and development expenses in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 13.8%, 9.8% and\n14.6%, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of general and administrative employees,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, depreciation on buildings, office furniture and equipment and professional\nfees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we\nexpand our operations, hire additional administrative personnel, incur depreciation expenses in connection with the\nincrease in office equipment and Fab 2, and incur additional compliance costs required of a publicly listed company\nin the United States.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries of sales and marketing employees, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, travel expenses and product sample costs. We expect that our sales and marketing\nexpenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts over the next several years. However, we believe that as we\ncontinue to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies, our sales and marketing expenses may\ndecline over time as a percentage of our revenues.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur share-based compensation expenses consist of various forms of share-based compensation that we have\nhistorically issued to our employees and consultants, as well as share-based compensation issued to employees,\ndirectors and service providers under our 2005 and 2011 long-term incentive plans. The 2005 plan was terminated in\nOctober 2010. We allocate such share-based compensation expenses to the applicable cost of revenues and expense\ncategories as related services are performed. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Under the\n60\nlong-term incentive plan, we granted RSUs on December 30, 2005 to our employees and directors and again on\nSeptember 29, 2006, September 26, 2007, September 29, 2008, September 28, 2009, September 28, 2010,\nSeptember 28, 2011, September 26, 2012, September 26, 2013, September 26, 2014, September 25, 2015,\nSeptember 28, 2016, September 29, 2017, September 26, 2018, September 28, 2020, September 28, 2021 and\nSeptember 28, 2022 to our employees. We did not grant RSUs in 2019 but granted stock options to employees\ninstead. Share-based compensation expenses recorded regarding RSUs under the long-term incentive plan totaled\n$4.8 million, $23.8 million and $20.0 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Share-based compensation\nexpenses recorded regarding stock options under the long-term incentive plan totaled $0.7 million in 2020.\nCash Awards.\nWe made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million and $19.3 million to the Company’s\nemployees among which $1.6 million and $1.0 million was immediately vested on September 28, 2021 and\nSeptember 28, 2022, respectively. The remainder will be equally vested at the first, second and third anniversaries of\nthe grant date.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries are incorporated in different jurisdictions, we file separate\nincome tax returns. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However, if\nthe relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be determined\nto be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income Tax Act and\nrelevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax in the ROC.\nWe recognize income taxes at the applicable statutory rates in accordance with the jurisdictions where our\nsubsidiaries are located and as adjusted for certain items including accumulated losses carried forward,\nnon-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits, as well as changes in our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used\nin the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and we use judgment and estimate to\ndetermine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period. Due to the rapid technological\nchanges, we estimate the net realizable value of inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of\nreporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon. The\ninventory write-downs in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were approximately $11.9 million, $9.4 million and $22.2 million,\nrespectively, and were included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-financial Assets other than Goodwill\nWe routinely review our non-financial assets at the reporting date to determine whether there is any indication\nof impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable\namount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In\nassessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount\nrate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. However,\ndue to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy, market requirements, or the needs of\nour customers, we may not always be in a position to accurately anticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or\nacquired technology until they occur. Although we have the recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we\nremain positive on the long-term prospect of our non-Driver product segment, judging by the expanding customer\nlist that covers some of the world’s biggest tech names, and the busy engineering activities going on with such\ncustomers. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we did not recognize any impairment loss on\nnon-financial assets.\n61\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the\ncash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of\nthe Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss.\nAn impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The assessment of\nimpairment of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgment to determine the identified CGU,\nallocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of\nestimating the recoverable amount of relevant CGU, management is required to make subjective judgments in\ndetermining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future\nrevenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, goodwill in Driver IC CGU and WLO CGU was $26,846 thousand and\n$1,292 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, we did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nAccording to the ROC Income Tax Act, dividends distributed by a Taiwan company to its foreign shareholders\nare subject to ROC withholding tax, currently at the rate of 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash\ndividends or on the par value of the ordinary shares in the case of stock dividends. The surtax rate for undistributed\nearnings is currently 5%. However, surtax paid on undistributed earnings can no longer be used to offset against the\nwithholding tax imposed on the dividend distributed to foreign shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have not provided for retained earnings tax on the undistributed earnings of\napproximately $1,282.1 million of our subsidiaries since we have specific plans to reinvest these earnings\nindefinitely. The undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are mainly from Himax Taiwan totaling\napproximately $1,280.8 million as of December 31, 2022. We intend to use accumulated and future earnings of\nHimax Taiwan to expand operations in Taiwan.\nHowever, a deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Taiwanese company can no longer demonstrate\nthat it plans to reinvest indefinitely these undistributed earnings. This amount becomes taxable when we execute\nother investments, share buybacks or shareholder dividends to be funded by cash distribution by our foreign\nsubsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such\nundistributed earnings.\nWe are a holding company located in the Cayman Islands and have paid dividends and repurchased outstanding\nshares. To fund such dividends and repurchases, in the past years, we have received cash from bank loans and from\nHimax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings instead of dividends distributed by Himax Taiwan.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required to\nestimate income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities for us and our subsidiaries. This process involves\nestimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of\nitems for tax and accounting purposes and the amount of tax credits and tax loss carry-forward. These differences\nresult in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nManagement must then assess deferred tax assets at each reporting date and reduce to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future\ntaxable profits improves.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of profit or loss as a percentage of\nrevenues:\n62\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nRevenues.................................................................................................................1 00.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues .................................................................................................. 75.1 51.6 59.5\nResearch and development .................................................................................. 13.8 9.8 14.6\nGeneral and administrative .................................................................................. 2.7 1.9 2.4\nSales and marketing ............................................................................................. 1.9 1.5 2.1\nTotal costs and expenses ......................................................................................... 93.5 64.8 78.6\nOperating income ................................................................................................... 6.5 35.2 21.4\nNon-operating income (loss) ..................................................................................

Our revenues decreased by 22.3% to $1,201.3 million in 2022 compared to $1,547.1 million in 2021.\nThe decrease was a result of a sudden halt in consumer demand starting at the end of the first quarter of 2022 due to\nseveral macro level factors that presented significant headwinds, including China city lockdowns from Covid-19,\ndecades-high inflation, rapidly rising interest rates, and the ongoing war. All of these factors adversely impacted\nbusiness visibility of panel houses and OEMs, resulting in a big dip in demand for our IC which consequently\nhampered our sales. The year-over-year sales decline was a result of weak demand across all the three segments as\nwe entered the second half of 2022.\nLarge-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from display drivers for large-sized application decreased by 33.7%\n⚫\nto $264.0 million in 2022 from $397.9 million in 2021. The decline was primarily from our customers\n63\nacross the board, from brands to panel houses, imposing stringent inventory control measures on the\nbackdrop of slowing end market sell-through.\nSmall and Medium-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from small and medium-sized display drivers\n⚫\ndecreased by 19.2% to $778.9 million in 2022 from $963.5 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily a\nresult of channel inventories across panel houses, OEMs and end brands remaining stubbornly high against\nthe backdrop of continued sluggish demand, especially on consumer electronic products. Sales for\nsmartphone and tablet took the brunt under such challenging market conditions. However, our automotive\nsegment continued to see extraordinary business momentum in 2022, showing the highest growth among\nall product lines, up more than 50%, on top of the strong 2021 when sales grew more than 110%. We\nanticipate automotive displays continuing to evolve at a rapid rate in the number, size and technological\nsophistication, implying higher content value of display ICs per vehicle. As the market share leader in\nautomotive display ICs, we continued to gain ground not only in DDIC but also in TDDI and many\nupcoming leading edge new technologies aiming further market share gains.\nNon-Driver Products. Revenues from non-driver products decreased by 14.7% to $158.4 million in 2022\n⚫\nfrom $185.7 million in 2021. The decrease was mainly from the decline of Tcon sales, which were\npressured by lower shipments of Tcon for TV, monitor and notebook markets, a drop in CMOS image\nsensor sales mainly as a result of muted notebook sales as well as a decrease in WLO. This decrease was\npartially offset by the increase of WiseEye sales.\nCosts and Expenses. Costs and expenses decreased by 5.8% to $943.8 million in 2022 from $1,002.1 million in\n2021. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased to 78.6% in 2022 compared to 64.8% in 2021.\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased to $714.2 million in 2022 from $798.5 million in 2021,\n⚫\nwhich was due primarily to a 39.0% decrease in unit shipments in 2022 but offset by rising material costs\nacross wafer foundry, assembly and testing. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to\n59.5% in 2022 from 51.6% in 2021, mainly due to higher cost of the inventory sourced primarily during\n2021 and early 2022 when foundry and back-end pricings were higher due to capacity constraints. In\naddition, charges related to unmet minimum purchase orders from contracts with foundries and backend\nsuppliers entered during the unprecedented shortage in 2021 also led to the higher cost. Also, inventory\nwrite-downs, which are included in cost of revenues, increased to $22.2 million in 2022 from $9.4 million\nin 2021. The increase stems from market price decline of certain unsold inventories which will necessitate\nwrite-downs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 16.0% to $175.6 million in\n⚫\n2022 from $151.4 million in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to increase in the RSU\ncompensation, cash awards, salary expense and tape-out expense. The increase in salary expense was due\nprimarily to a larger headcount of research and development staff and higher average salaries, but partially\noffset by NT dollar depreciation against the US dollar as we pay the bulk of our employee salaries in NT\ndollars.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased by 2.7% to $28.5 million in\n⚫\n2022 from $29.3 million in 2021, primarily as a result of decreases in professional fees but partially offset\nby increases in RSU compensation and cash awards.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 10.3% to $25.5 million in 2022 from\n⚫\n$23.1 million in 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to increase in RSU compensation and cash\nawards.\nNon-Operating Income (loss). We had net non-operating income of $19.0 million in 2022 compared to net\nnon-operating loss of $0.4 million in 2021. The increase was primarily due to a gain from disposal of a subsidiary,\nincreases in foreign currency exchange gains and interest income but partially offset by an increase in finance costs.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense decreased to $41.1 million in 2022 from $110.7 million in 2021.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased to 14.9% from 20.3% in 2021. The decrease in our effective income tax rate\nwas primarily attributable to the higher tax benefit rate in tax credits and tax saving from disposal of subsidiary.\nProfit for the year. As a result of the foregoing, our profit for 2022 was $235.5 million in 2022, versus $433.9\n64\nmillion in 2021, and profit attributable to Himax stockholders was $237.0 million in 2022, versus $436.9 million in\n2021.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth the revenues and operating results for our reportable segments for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment Revenues ..................................................................................................\nDriver IC .......................................................................................................$.. ..7..5 6,522 $1,361,442 $1,042,938\nNon-Driver Products ..................................................................................... ....1..3 0,760 185,655 158,401\nTotal ..................................................................................................................$.. ..8..8 7,282 $1,547,097 $1,201,339\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\nDriver IC .......................................................................................................$.. ....9 8,687 $ 551,943 $ 275,275\nNon-Driver Products ..................................................................................... .....(.4 0,761) (6,922) (17,688)\nTotal ..................................................................................................................$.. ....5 7,926 $ 545,021 $ 257,587\nDriver IC Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Driver IC segment decreased by 23.4% to $1,042.9 million in 2022\nfrom $1,361.4 million in 2021. The decline was from the decrease in display drivers for large-sized application and\nsmall and medium-sized application as a result of a sudden halt in consumer demand due to several macro level\nfactors which presented significant headwinds.\nSegment operating income. Operating income from the Driver IC segment decreased to $275.3 million in 2022\nfrom $551.9 million in 2021. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues and lower gross\nmargin, which was mainly attributable to pricing pressure resulting from excess inventory levels following the\nsudden halt in consumer demand.\nNon-Driver Products Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased by 14.7% to $158.4 million\nin 2022 from $185.7 million in 2021. The year-over-year decrease was mainly from decline in Tcon revenues,\nCMOS imaging sensor business as well as WLO. This decrease was partially offset by the increase of WiseEye\nsales.\nSegment operating loss. Operating loss from the Non-Driver Products segment increased to $17.7 million in\n2022 from $6.9 million in 2021. The operating loss increases were attributable mainly to the decline in revenues and\nincrease in cash awards.\n5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe need cash primarily for technology advancement, capacity expansion, paying dividends and working capital.\nWe have historically been able to meet our cash requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings to\npay dividends.\n65\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had total current assets of $1,336.8 million, total current liabilities of $694.0\nmillion and cash and cash equivalents of $221.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had short-term secured\nborrowings of $369.3 million with cash and time deposits of $369.3 million as collateral, and long-term unsecured\nborrowings of $46.5 million, of which $6.0 million was current portion. For enhancing the guaranty, our land,\nbuilding and improvements of Fab 2 totaling $65.6 million were pledged as collateral for the long-term unsecured\nborrowings. As of December 31, 2022, we had total unused short-term credit lines of $323.2 million, of which\n$190.7 million belonging to the parent company, Himax Technologies, Inc., needs to be secured with an equal\namount of cash and time deposits when borrowing money from banks. Further, we had unused long-term credit lines\nof $83.5 million. We believe that our existing short-term and long-term credit lines, together with cash generated\nfrom our operations, are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to meet our present working capital\nrequirements through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities .........................................................$.. ..1..0. 2 ,610 $ 388,276 $ 82,908\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities ...............................................(.2. 2 ,365) (232,680) 14,998\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities ................................................. 3 ,261 (4,487) (211,068)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents .............................................8. 3 ,883 151,086 (114,443)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period ................................................1..0. 1 ,055 184,938 336,024\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period ..........................................................1..8. 4 ,938 336,024 221,581\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was $82.9 million compared to $388.3\nmillion in 2021. This decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 was mainly due to lower profit,\nthe inventory level higher than usual from sudden halt in consumer demand and an increase in cash paid for income\ntax in 2022 compared to 2021.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2022 was $15.0 million compared to net cash\nused in investing activities of $232.7 million in 2021. This increase in net cash provided by investing activities was\ndue primarily to a decrease of $206.9 million in refundable deposits made for securing foundry capacity, an increase\nof $34.4 million in net cash provided by disposal of financial assets at amortized cost in 2022 compared to 2021 and\nan increase in cash provided by disposal of subsidiary of $14.8 million.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2022 was $211.1 million compared to $4.5 million\nin 2021. This change was due primarily to increases in distribution of cash dividends in 2022 and a decrease of\nguarantee deposits received from customers.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products that are subject to rapid\ntechnological change, among other factors, which could result in revenue variability in future periods. In addition,\nwe have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of our customers. The extension of payment terms\nfor our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results. Our subsidiaries’ ability\nto distribute dividends and other payments to us may be limited by ROC regulations. See “Risk Factors — Risks\nRelated to Our Holding Company Structure — Our ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from\nour subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and\nconduct our business.”\nTo address the continuing foundry capacity shortage worldwide, we have entered into strategic agreements with\nour foundry partners in order to secure their foundry capacity to fulfill our business needs. Under these strategic\nagreements, we are committed to purchasing a specific volume at fixed prices or variable prices. Some of our\ncustomers, and even our indirect customers, are also entering into similar strategic agreements to secure their IC\nsupplies with us. However, there can be no assurance that these prices provided in the strategic agreements with our\nfoundry partners and our customers will always remain competitive during the contract term. For example, in the\nevent that the global semiconductor market changes due to foundry capacity expansion and/or shrunken customer\ndemand, the fixed prices we agree to pay our foundry partners may become significantly higher than the then\nprevailing market price. On the other hand, if there continues to be foundry capacity shortages and/or increases in\ncustomer demand, the fixed prices our customers agree to pay us may become significantly lower than the then\n66\nprevailing market price. Any of those situations could materially adversely impact our pricing strategies,\ncompetitive position, profitability and results of operation. We may also be subject to contractual penalties if we are\nunable to purchase the committed volume from our foundry partners. In addition, since these strategic agreements\nwith our foundry partners typically require us to make prepayments or refundable deposits to such foundry partners,\nour cash flow, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected. Nevertheless, we believe these strategic\nagreements will enable us to meet our customers’ unaddressed demands and are in the best interest of our company\namid the global foundry capacity shortage.\nWe have entered into several wafer fabrication or assembly and testing service arrangements or multi-year\npurchase agreements with suppliers. We may be obligated to make payments for purchase orders entered into\npursuant to these arrangements. Our purchase obligations also include agreements to purchase goods or services,\nprimarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including\nfixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the\ntransaction. Among all these purchase agreements, the longest termination term shall expire in 2028. Purchase\nobligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Contractual obligations resulting from above\npurchase orders and agreements with known amounts approximate $2,088 million as of December 31, 2022. Of\nobligations under above purchase orders and agreements, $625 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\nOur capital expenditures were incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of property and equipment.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $5.8 million, $7.6 million and $11.8 million in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nCapital expenditures of $11.8 million in 2022 was mainly for design tools, R&D related equipment as well as\nin-house tester of our traditional IC design business.\nThe capex budget will be funded through our internal resources and banking facilities, if so needed. We will\ncontinue to make capital expenditures to meet the expected growth of our operations. We believe that our working\ncapital and borrowings under our existing and future credit lines should be sufficient for our present requirements.\n5.C. Research and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our core technologies and know-how\nrelating to the semiconductor solutions we offer to the flat panel display industry. In particular, we have committed a\nsignificant portion of our resources to the research and development of non-driver products because we believe in\nthe long-term business prospects of such products and are committed to continuing to diversify our product portfolio.\nAlthough a significant portion of the resources at our integrated circuit design center are invested in advanced\nresearch for future products, we continue to invest in improving the performance and reducing the costs of our\nexisting products. Our application engineers, who provide on-system verification of semiconductors and product\nspecifications, and field application engineers, who provide on-site engineering support at our customers’ offices or\nfactories, work closely with panel manufacturers to co-develop display solutions for their electronic devices. In\n2020, 2021 and 2022, we incurred research and development expenses of $122.3 million, $151.4 million and $175.6\nmillion, respectively, representing 13.8%, 9.8% and 14.6% of our revenues, respectively.\n5.D. Trend Information\nUnexpected lockdowns in China, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic related factors all created a\nchallenging operating environment and impaired our business performance during 2022. The sudden halt in\nconsumer demand significantly reduced visibility at panel houses and OEMs towards the end of the first quarter of\n2022 resulting in elevated inventories which adversely impacted IC demand and consequently our sales. In the face\nof all these headwinds, all three major segments experienced year-over-year declines.\nLooking ahead to 2023, our focus is on reducing our inventory to near historic average levels. We have made\ngood progress in destocking inventory since its peak during the third quarter of 2022 by curtailing our wafer starts to\nstrike a balance between inventory levels and foundry contract fulfillment. We are also striving to win more projects\nfrom customers specifically for the purpose of digesting excess inventory. Overall, the semiconductor industry\nappears to be trending toward a post-pandemic era. While the supply chain gradually stabilizes and channel\ninventory reverts to heathier levels, we believe a decent recovery is forthcoming.\nLarge-sized Display Driver IC Segment\nHimax’s outlook for large size driver IC business remains soft with moderating TV sell-through and muted\nChromebook sales. For TV business, a recovery appears to be underway already backed by stabilizing TV panel\n67\nprices and customers replenishing chips, particularly for mainstream models. Conversely on IT segment, we expect\nfurther declines due to ongoing enterprise IT budget cuts in tandem with customers’ continuous stringent inventory\ncontrol measures.\nFor the longer-term perspective, Himax remains positive on the prospect of our large display driver business.\nWe are armed with a diversified and comprehensive product offering, which provides us with the flexibility to\nquickly direct production towards sectors where demand is relatively strong in tandem with our customers and\nsuppliers. We also have tight strategic relationships with some of the leading end customers in TV, monitor and\nnotebook markets, and our project design coverage across all markets with all major panel makers remains strong.\nWith demand for advanced displays expected to remain strong, we continue to focus on higher end displays and\npremium models by offering advanced driver ICs and Tcons for a one-stop shopping experience for leading end\ncustomers in TV, monitor and notebook markets. We also support feature upgrades for customers’ next generation\nproducts, including high-speed interface, low power consumption, higher refresh rate, ultra-large-sized,\nhigh-aspect-ratio and curved-view design. All these represent a high barrier of entry that differentiates us from\nChina local competition.\nSmall and Medium-Sized Display Driver IC Segment\nHimax remains the market share leader in display driver IC for automotive and tablet. For automotive market,\nwe are deepening our working relationships with Tier 1 players and end customers across the globe. In 2023, we\nexpect the automotive segment to continue to be our single largest revenue contributor with sales for automotive\nTDDI set to outgrow that of traditional automotive driver IC, backed by rapid expansion of automotive TDDI\nadoption and strong foundry capacity support. Our automotive TDDI sales are expected to be one of the primary\ndriving forces for our long-term business growth for years to come. Himax has a comprehensive product roadmap,\nnew design-wins with end customers and Tier 1s, and a foundry capacity advantage that positions the Company to\ncontinue to gain market share, particularly in the fast-expanding automotive TDDI market. Himax dominates\nautomotive TDDI design-in and design-wins with direct and indirect customers across the continents for a\ntechnology that is essential for very large sized, stylish, and free-formed automotive displays. We have been\nawarded more than 200 automotive TDDI projects with only a small portion currently in mass production, implying\na potential enormous growth opportunity ahead. In addition, with years of strenuous work on this high entry barrier\ntechnology, we have developed comprehensive local dimming Tcon product offerings that can support a wide range\nof design covering super high frame rate of 240 Hz and resolutions of up to 8K. Our position remains unchallenged\nin the up-and-coming local dimming technology, which not only enhances display contrast for better viewing under\nbright daylight, but also provides effective power saving, which is critical for larger displays and EV models.\nNumerous Tier 1s, and car makers have awarded us projects for premium new car models with only a few having\ncommenced mass production in 2022. In 2023, we expect very strong annual growth as the adoption extends from\npremium car models to mainstream models. Last but not least, Himax offers high-speed P2P bridge and LTDI\nsolutions are specially designed for typically larger than 30 inches or a pillar-to-pillar display. These solutions can\ncascade up to 30 chips in support of ultrahigh-resolution displays, usually more than 7Kx1K, and offer\nhigh-precision touch sensitivity, creating a high entry barrier for potential competitors. United with a top-Tier\nautomotive digital platform provider, our cutting edge LTDI technology was showcased at CES 2023 by one of our\nleading panel customers for a 55-inch pillar-to-pillar, in-cell touch display that provides seamless, intuitive and\nadvanced tactile experience for future generation smart cabins. LTDI is scheduled to start mass production from\n2023. Given all the new demand for advanced automotive display technologies, we expect decent sales growth to\ncontinue for our automotive sector in 2023, a continuation from two years of remarkable growth in 2021, where\nsales grew more than 110%, and up more than 50% in 2022.\nOn the tablet market, Himax still has a leading position, especially on the non-iOS market, as market adoption\nof TDDI continues. In 2023, we see shipments on the rise for premium models that adopt advanced AMOLED\ndisplay, of which Himax offers both DDIC and Tcon. We also see increasing demand for LCD display towards\nhigher frame rate, higher resolution, larger screen size, and active stylus for better-quality handwriting and drawing\nuser experience. Both these trends lend support to our profit margin as they are higher than corporate average\nproducts. As for smartphone business, in 2023 our focus will be on offloading inventory. We expect to gain higher\nexposure when our smartphone AMOLED solution is available, which is set to start mass production from the\nsecond half of 2023. As expected, our traditional discrete driver IC into smartphone and tablet continue to be\nquickly replaced by TDDI.\nHimax continues to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC development in partnership with major Chinese and\nKorean panel makers. Our AMOLED solution for tablet commenced mass production in the first quarter of 2022\n68\nwith both AMOLED driver and Tcon total solution provided for a global leading tablet customer. Our flexible\nAMOLED driver and Tcon for automotive display also successfully ramped up for a customer’s flagship EV model\nin the first quarter of 2022. The number of awarded projects with worldwide conventional car makers and EV\nvendors continues to increase. In addition, we are making good progress with leading panel houses for the\ndevelopment of AMOLED display drivers for smartphone, TV and notebook applications. We expect small sales\ncontribution from the second half of 2023 with shipments to increase considerably starting 2024. We foresee\nAMOLED driver IC soon becoming one of the major growth drivers for our small and medium-sized panel driver IC\nbusiness.\nNon-Driver IC Segment\nThe non-driver category has been our most exciting growth area and a differentiator for the Company. We are\ndevoted to the development, manufacturing and marketing of non-driver products to diversify our customer base and\nproduct portfolio to offer total solutions of timing controller, image processing and human interface related\ntechnologies in addition to our driver IC products.\nOn timing controller, we are optimistic about the long-term growth prospect of the Tcon business where we\nhave successfully positioned ourselves for higher end and higher value-added areas including 4K/8K TV, gaming\nTV and monitor, low power notebook in view of consumers’ pursuance of various new types of entertainment for\nfilm, television and gaming as well as automotive, particularly with local dimming feature. With years of strenuous\nwork on this high entry barrier technology, we have developed comprehensive local dimming Tcon product\nofferings that can support a wide range of design covering super high frame rate of 240 Hz and resolutions of up to\n8K. We began mass production on a few projects in the second quarter of 2022 and expect robust growth starting in\n2023 backed by numerous project awards from various named panel makers, Tier 1s and car makers for premium\nnew car models. In addition, we commenced mass production of AMOLED TCON together with DDIC in\nautomotive and tablet applications starting in early 2022 where the design-wins with leading tablet and NEV\ncustomers continue to expand. We believe the Tcon segment will be one of the driving forces for our non-driver\nbusiness moving forward.\nDuring 2016, our non-driver businesses experienced tremendous growth, primarily driven by the LCOS and\nWLO businesses due to shipments to one of our leading AR device customers. WLO shipments increased\nconsiderably year-over-year in 2018 because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in more models. In 2022, we\ncontinued to fulfill anchor customer’s demand for the legacy product. The WLO technology continues to play an\nimportant role in shaping next generation optical applications. As an illustration, our WLO technology can be\ndeployed to empower 3D perception sensing for precise controller-free gesture recognition in VR devices. We\nexpect volume production starting middle of 2023. On 3D scanning for object reconstruction where our WLO\ntechnology also plays a key role, our 3D sensing technology, which incorporates both our 3D projector and 3D\ndecoder, is being deployed by a leading customer’s 3D scanning device for the purpose of generating real time\ndigital twins, avatars and 3D environment surroundings that ultimately help users transit and connect seamlessly\nbetween physical and digital worlds. Promising progress has been made and we expect it to hit the market with\nsmall volume from 2024. Our exceptional optical design knowledge, together with our production proven\nnanoimprinting capabilities and mass manufacturing experience, allow us to deliver high-quality solutions to meet\nthe requirements of the future generation optical applications across automotive, consumer, industrial, medical\napplications, AR/VR/ MR devices and many other applications.\nRegarding ultralow power WiseEye smart image sensing, the demand for resource-constrained and\nbattery-powered end point applications with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. Our WiseEye AI solution is\ndesigned for a wide range of ultralow power use cases that aim to modernize legacy end-point devices, which lack\nAI capability, with ultralow power computer vision AI.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for options\ngranted to participants outside the United States, the committee can set options that have terms greater than ten\nyears.\nOptions will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such terms and conditions as the committee approves.\nA condition of the delivery of shares as to which an option will be exercised will be the payment of the exercise\nprice. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of written notification of\nexercise and full payment, we will deliver to the participant evidence of book-entry shares or, upon his or her\nrequest, share certificates in an appropriate amount based on the number of shares purchased under the option(s).\nThe committee may impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option as it may\ndeem advisable.\nEach participant’s award document will set forth the extent to which he or she will have the right to exercise the\noptions following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 2,226,690 units employee stock options to our certain employees on September 30, 2019\nwith exercise price $2.27 per option.

Major Shareholders\nOn August 10, 2009, we effected certain changes in our capital stock structure in order to meet the Taiwan\nStock Exchange’s primary listing requirement that the par value of shares be NT$10 or $0.3 per share and in order to\nincrease the number of outstanding ordinary shares to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In particular, we\nincreased our authorized share capital from $50,000 (divided into 500,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) to\n$300,000,000 (divided into 3,000,000,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) and distributed 5,999 bonus shares\nfor each share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. These were followed by a\nconsolidation of every 3,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each into one ordinary share of par value $0.3 each. As a\nresult, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was doubled and each of our ordinary shares had a par value of\n$0.3.\nIn connection with the above changes, we also changed our ADS ratio effective August 10, 2009 from one ADS\nrepresenting one ordinary share to one ADS representing two ordinary shares. Such change in ADS ratio was\nintended to adjust for the net dilutive effect due to the bonus shares distribution and the shares consolidation so that\neach ADS would represent the same percentage ownership in our share capital immediately before and after the\nabove changes. The number of ADSs also remained the same immediately before and after the above changes.\nAs of March 31, 2023, 348,833,050 of our shares were outstanding. We believe that, of such shares,\n212,779,660 shares in the form of ADSs were registered in the name of a nominee of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nthe depositary under our ADS deposit agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., advised us that, as of March 31,\n2023, 106,389,830 ADSs, representing 212,779,660 common shares, were held of record by Cede & Co. and 8 other\nregistered shareholders domiciled in and outside of the United States. We have no further information as to common\nshares held, or beneficially owned, by U.S. persons.\nThe following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as\nof March 31, 2023, the most recent practicable date, by (i) each shareholder known by us to beneficially own more\nthan 5% of our shares and (ii) all directors and executive officers as a group.\n79\nPercentage of\nShares\nNumber of Shares Beneficially\nName of Beneficial Owner Beneficially Owned(3) Owned(3)\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu(1) .............................................................................. 76,904,468 22.0%\nWhei-Lan Teng(2) .................................................................................... 22,868,370 6.6%\nAll directors and executive officers as a group(3) ...................................... 85,317,015 24.5%\nNote: (1) Dr. Biing-Seng Wu directly owns 315,322 ordinary shares.

Additionally, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu beneficially owns 474,259 ADSs purchased through\nSanfair Asia Investments Ltd. in the open market according to his share purchase plan announced on\nDecember 3, 2021. Accordingly, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of\n76,904,468 ordinary shares, representing approximately 22.0% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(2) Whei-Lan Teng directly owns 1,335,548 ordinary shares. Whei-Lan Teng beneficially owns 4,120,370\nordinary shares through Renmar Finance Limited, which is an investment company controlled by\nWhei-Lan Teng. In addition, Whei-Lan Teng, may be attributed beneficial ownership of 17,412,452\nordinary shares held in trust by Corenmar Investment Limited for the benefit of her children. Whei-Lan\nTeng therefore may be deemed to have shared power to vote or dispose of 22,868,370 ordinary shares.\nAccordingly, Whei-Lan Teng may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 22,868,370 ordinary\nshares, representing approximately 6.6% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(3) Numbers of shares beneficially owned by all directors and executive officers as a group already include\nan aggregate of 76,904,468 ordinary shares beneficially owned by Dr. Biing-Seng Wu.\nNone of our major shareholders has voting rights different from those of other shareholders.

Dividends and Dividend Policy\nSubject to the Cayman Islands Companies Law, we may declare dividends in any currency, but no dividend\nmay be declared in excess of the amount recommended by our board of directors. Whether our board of directors\nrecommends any dividends and the form, frequency and amount of dividends, if any, will depend upon our future\noperations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and\nother factors as the board of directors may deem relevant.\nOn June 27, 2008, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $66.8 million, or the equivalent of $0.350 per ADS.\nIn 2009, we paid a cash dividend on June 29, 2009 in the amount of $55.5 million, or the equivalent of $0.300 per\nADS, and distributed a stock dividend on August 10, 2009 of 5,999 ordinary shares of par value $0.0001 for each\nordinary share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. On August 13, 2010, we\npaid a cash dividend in the amount of $44.1 million, or the equivalent of $0.250 per ADS. On July 20, 2011, we paid\na cash dividend in the amount of $21.2 million, or the equivalent of $0.120 per ADS.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.”\nThe dividends for any of these years should not be considered representative of the dividends that would be paid in\nany future periods or of our dividend policy.\nOur ability to pay cash or stock dividends will depend, at least partially, upon the amount of funds received by\nus from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, which must comply with the laws and regulations of their respective\ncountries and respective articles of association. We receive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany\nborrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends in the past. In accordance with amended ROC Company\nAct and regulations and Himax Taiwan’s amended articles of incorporation, Himax Taiwan is permitted to distribute\ndividends after allowances have been made for:\npayment of taxes;\n⚫\n81\nrecovery of prior years’ deficits, if any;\n⚫\nlegal reserve (in an amount equal to 10% of annual profits after having deducted the above items until such\n⚫\ntime as its legal reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital);\nspecial reserve based on relevant laws or regulations, or retained earnings, if necessary; and\n⚫\ndividends for preferred shares, if any.\n⚫\nFurthermore, if Himax Taiwan does not generate any profits for any year as determined in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in Taiwan, it generally may not distribute dividends for that year.\nAny dividend we declare will be paid to the holders of ADSs, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, to\nthe same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, less the\nfees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Any dividend we declare will be distributed by the\ndepositary bank to the holders of our ADSs. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S.\ndollars.\n8.B.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur shareholders previously adopted the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association on September 26,\n2005 by a special resolution passed by the sole shareholder of our company and the Amended and Restated Articles\n82\nof Association at an extraordinary shareholder meeting held on October 25, 2005, both of which were filed as an\nexhibit to our registration statement on Form F-1 (file no. 333-132372) with the SEC on March 13, 2006.\nAt our annual general meeting on August 6, 2009, our shareholders adopted the Second Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, which became effective on August 10, 2009 and were filed as exhibits to\nour current report on Form 6-K with the SEC on July 13, 2009. These were adopted primarily in connection with our\nproposed Taiwan listing to meet the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s primary listing requirement concerning protection of\nmaterial shareholders’ rights under the ROC’s Company Act and Securities Exchange Act. At the same time, our\nshareholders also adopted the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were\nfiled as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 with the SEC on\nJune 3, 2010 and are substantially the same as the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nof our company except that our authorized share capital is stated to be $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000\nshares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each, on the condition that it shall become effective if the application made by\nour company to list its ordinary shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange is rejected or aborted. On May 20, 2010, the\nThird Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association became effective as a result of the\ntermination of our primary listing application to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\nWe incorporate by reference into this annual report the description of our Amended and Restated Memorandum\nand Articles of Association (except for provisions relating to our authorized share capital) contained in our F-1\nregistration statement (File No. 333-132372) filed with the SEC on March 13, 2006. Such description sets forth a\nsummary of certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association as currently in effect, which is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles\nof Association. As of the date of this annual report, our authorized share capital is $300,000,000 divided into\n1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each.\n10.C. Material Contracts\nWe are not currently, and have not been in the last two years, party to any material contract, other than contracts\nentered into the ordinary course of business.\n10.D. Exchange Controls\nWe have extracted from publicly available documents the information presented in this section. The information\nbelow may be applicable because our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, is incorporated in the\nROC. Please note that citizens of the PRC and entities organized in the PRC are subject to special ROC laws, rules\nand regulations, which are not discussed in this section.\nThe ROC’s Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions\nmust be executed by banks designated to handle foreign exchange transactions by the Central Bank of the ROC.\nThere is an annual limit on the amount of currency a Taiwanese entity may convert into, or out of, NT dollars other\nthan for trade purposes. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.\nWith regard to inward and outward remittances (foreign exchange purchased or sold), approval by the Central\nBank of the ROC is generally required for any conversion exceeding, in aggregate in each calendar year, $50 million\n(and /or its equivalent) for companies and $5 million (and/or its equivalent) for Taiwanese and long term 1\nyear-valid resident permit of foreign individuals. A requirement is also imposed on all private enterprises to report\nall medium- and long-term foreign debt with the Central Bank of the ROC.\nIn addition, a foreign person without an alien resident card or an unrecognized foreign entity may remit to and\nfrom Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $100,000 per remittance if required documentation is provided to the ROC\nauthorities. This limit applies only to remittances involving a conversion between NT dollars and U.S. dollars or\nother foreign currencies.\n10.E. Taxation\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains\nor appreciation, and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely\nto be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be\n83\napplicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman\nIslands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in\nthe Cayman Islands.\nWe have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, obtained\nan undertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:\n(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or gains or\nappreciations shall apply to us or our operations;\n(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our\nordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.\nThe undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from May 3, 2005.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders described\nbelow of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive\ndescription of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to hold the securities. This\ndiscussion applies only to a U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. This discussion does not address any aspect of the “Medicare contributions tax” on “net investment\nincome.” In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the U.S.\nHolder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences\napplicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:\ncertain financial institutions;\n⚫\ndealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;\n⚫\npersons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion\n⚫\ntransaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the ordinary\nshares or ADSs;\npersons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;\n⚫\nentities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n⚫\ntax-exempt entities, including “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”;\n⚫\npersons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of our voting stock; or\n⚫\npersons holding ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the\n⚫\nUnited States.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares or\nADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ordinary shares or ADSs and partners in such partnerships should\nconsult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the\nordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative pronouncements,\njudicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof. These laws are\nsubject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on representations by the depositary and\nassumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in\naccordance with its terms. You should consult your tax adviser concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S.\ntax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a person that is, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ordinary\nshares or ADSs and is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a\n84\ncorporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; or (iii)\nan estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the\nunderlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S.\nHolder exchanges ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.\nThe U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released before\ndelivery of shares to the depositary (“pre-release”) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of\nforeign tax credits for U.S. holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the\nclaiming of the preferred rates of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate\nU.S. holders. Accordingly, the availability of the preferential tax rates for dividends received by certain\nnon-corporate U.S. Holders, described below, could be affected by actions taken by parties to whom ADSs are\npre-released.\nThis discussion assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company (as\ndiscussed below).\nTaxation of Distributions\nDistributions received by U.S. Holders with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs, other than certain pro rata\ndistributions of ordinary shares, will constitute foreign-source dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nto the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined in accordance with U.S.\nfederal income tax principles. We do not to maintain records of earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal\nincome tax principles, and therefore it is expected that distributions will generally be reported to U.S. Holders as\ndividends. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s (or in the case of\nADSs, the depository’s) receipt of the dividends. Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion above\nregarding concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury, certain dividends paid by qualified foreign corporations to\ncertain non-corporate holders may be taxable at preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A foreign\ncorporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on stock that is readily\ntradable on a securities market in the United States, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where our ADSs\nare traded. Our ordinary shares are not traded on a securities market in the United States. Non-corporate U.S.\nHolders of our ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their tax advisers regarding their eligibility for taxation at\nsuch preferential rates and whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at such\npreferential rates. Corporate U.S. Holders will not be entitled to claim the dividends-received deduction with respect\nto dividends paid by us.\nSale and Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\nA U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on\nthe sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary\nshares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S. Holders\nmay be taxable at preferential rates. The amount of gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount\nrealized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nWe believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn general, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year in\nwhich (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents and royalties)\nor (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the\nproduction of, passive income (including cash). If a corporation owns at least 25% (by value) of the stock of another\ncorporation, the corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning its proportionate share of the\n25%-owned subsidiary’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s income. As\nPFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets from time to time\n(and the value of our assets may be determined, in part, based on the market price of our shares and ADSs, which\n85\nmay fluctuate considerably from time to time given that market prices of certain technology companies historically\nhave been volatile), there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable year.\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held ordinary shares or ADSs, certain\nadverse U.S. federal income tax rules would apply on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of ordinary\nshares or ADSs by the U.S. Holder. In general, under those rules, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or\nother disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any\nyear before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year\nwould be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable\nyear, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax attributable to such allocated amounts. Similar rules would\napply to any distribution in respect of ordinary shares or ADSs to the extent in excess of 125% of the average of the\nannual distributions on ordinary shares or ADSs received by the U.S. Holder during the preceding three years or the\nU.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter. Certain elections may be available that would result in\nalternative treatments (such as a mark-to-market treatment of the ADSs). U.S. Holders should consult their tax\nadvisers to determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the consequences of the\nalternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances.\nIf we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year, the preferential tax\nrates discussed above with respect to dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders would not apply.\nIn addition, if a U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares or ADSs during any year in which we are a PFIC, the U.S.\nHolder may be required to file certain information reports, containing such information as the U.S. Treasury may\nrequire.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related\nfinancial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding,\nunless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any\nbackup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is\ntimely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\n10.F.

Annual Report to Security Holders\nNot applicable.\n86\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates is primarily the interest income\ngenerated by our cash deposited with banks. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks related to bank\nborrowings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. The U.S. dollar is also the functional\ncurrency for the majority of our operations. In 2022, more than 99% of our sales and cost of revenues were\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. However, in December 2022 approximately 61% of our operating expenses were\ndenominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won and Chinese\nRenminbi, and the majority of the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in\nconformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated April\n6, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining,\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\ncommittee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment assessment of non-financial asset, excluding goodwill in the Wafer Level Optics cash\ngenerating unit\nAs discussed in Note 14 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the balance of other intangible\nassets and property, plant and equipment were $1,094 thousand and $126,138 thousand, respectively as\nof December 31, 2022, a portion of which related to the Wafer Level Optics cash generating unit (“CGU”).\nThe Company’s non-financial assets excluding goodwill are reviewed at the reporting date to determine\nwhether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, impairment assessment will\nbe performed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the\nhigher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The value in use is determined by\ndiscounting the estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\nWe identified the impairment assessment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill in the Wafer Level\nOptics CGU as a critical audit matter because of the high degree of subjective auditor’s judgment required\nin evaluating the forecasted future revenues and discount rate assumptions and minor changes to those\nassumptions could have a significant effect on the Company’s impairment assessment of non-financial\nassets in the Wafer Level Optics CGU. In addition, the evaluation of the discount rate involved specialized\nskills and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We\ntested certain internal controls over the Company’s impairment assessment process of non-financial assets\nexcluding goodwill, including controls related to the determination of forecasted future revenues and the\nassumptions used to develop the discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted future revenues\nby comparing available subsequent purchase orders and industry revenue forecast. We compared the\nCompany’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately\nforecast future revenues. We performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted future revenues and\ndiscount rate to assess their impact on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In addition, we involved\nvaluation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s\ndiscount rate, by comparing it against an estimated discount rates developed independently based on\nmarket data and inputs.\n/s/KPMG\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nApril 6, 2023\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The Company is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs\nand timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive,\ndigital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nelectronics devices. Additionally, the Company designs and provides controllers for touch\nsensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions,\nAMOLED ICs, LED driver ICs, power management ICs and LCoS micro-displays for\naugmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. The Company\nalso offers CMOS image sensors, wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and ultralow\npower WiseEye smart image sensing, which are used in a wide variety of applications such\nas mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home\nappliance, AIoT, etc.\n(c) Foreign Currency\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (USD). The functional\ncurrency for the Company and its major operating subsidiaries is the USD. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the USD are\nincluded in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting\ncurrency (the USD) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. Equity\naccounts are translated at historical rates. The statements of profit or loss and cash flows are\ntranslated at the average exchange rates at the date of transaction. Translation gains or losses\nare accumulated as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome.\n(d) Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash,\nsold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are\nobligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one\nyear from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as\ncurrent are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash comprise cash balances and demand deposits. Cash equivalents comprise short-term\nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are\nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. Deposits with an original\nmaturity of three months or less at the time of purchase but not for investments and other\npurposes and are qualified with the aforementioned criteria are classified as cash equivalent.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(f) Financial Instruments\nThe Company shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of\nfinancial position when, and only when, the Company becomes party to the contractual\nprovisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be\nrecognized and derecognized, as applicable, using trade date accounting.\n1. Financial Assets\n(i) Classification of financial assets\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the\nfinancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets\nare classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, measured\nat fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is\ngenerally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its\ncontractual cash flow characteristics. When, and only when, the Company changes\nits business model for managing financial assets it shall reclassify all affected\nfinancial assets.\ni. Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following\nconditions and is not designated as measured at fair value through profit or\nloss:\n(i) the asset held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets\nto collect contractual cash flows; and\n(ii) the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is\nreduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and\nlosses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on\nderecognition is recognized in profit or loss.\nii. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI)\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the\nCompany may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the\ninvestment’s fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-\ninvestment basis.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nEquity investments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value.\nDividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly\nrepresents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and\nlosses are recognized in OCI. When an investment is derecognized, the\ncumulative gain or loss in equity will not be reclassified to profit or loss,\ninstead, is reclassified to retained earnings.\niii. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss.\nSuch financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, and attributable\ntransaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to\ninitial recognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial\nassets measured at amortized cost (including accounts receivable).\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to\nlifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and contract\nassets, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount\nequal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial\ninstrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss\nallowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from\nall possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and\nsupportable information that is relevant. This includes both qualitative and\nquantitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical\nexperience and credit assessment as well as forward-looking information.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all\nfinancial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount\nthrough a loss allowance account.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(iii) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset\nand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to\nanother entity.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and\nreceivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an\ninvestment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had\nbeen recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained\nearnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n2. Financial Liabilities\n(i) Classification of financial liability\nThe Company classify all financial liabilities as measured at amortized cost, except\nfor financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities,\nincluding derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair\nvalue.\n(ii) Derecognition of financial liability\nThe Company removes a financial liability from its statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, it is extinguished-when the obligation specified in the\ncontract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability at amortized cost in its entirety, the\ndifference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or\ntransferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash\nassets transferred or liabilities assumed, shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n(g) Inventories\nInventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods awaiting\nfinal assembly and test and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ndetermined using the weighted-average method. For work-in-process and manufactured\ninventories, cost consists of the cost of raw materials (primarily fabricated wafer and\nprocessed tape), direct labor and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net\nrealizable value for raw materials is based on replacement cost. Net realizable value for\nfinished goods and work in process is calculated based on the estimated selling price less all\nestimated costs of completion and necessary selling costs.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(h) Equity Method Investments\nEquity investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over the operating and financial policy decisions of the investee but does not have\na controlling financial interest in the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. The\nCompany’s share of the net income or net loss of an investee is recognized in earnings from\nthe date the significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.\nThe difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net\nassets of an investee at investment date is allocated to related assets which are amortized over\ntheir useful lives. Any unallocated difference is treated as investor-level goodwill and is not\namortized.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company\nceases to have significant influence over an associate, and then measures the retained interests\nat fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the\ndate the equity method was discontinued and the fair value of the retained interests along with\nany proceeds from disposing of a part of the interest in the associate is recognized in profit or\nloss. When the Company discontinues the use of the equity method, the Company shall\naccount for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to\nthat investment on the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, if there is any indication of impairment, the entire\ncarrying amount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment as a single\nasset, by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. An impairment loss\nrecognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment in associates. Accordingly,\nany reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount\nof the investment subsequently increases.\n(i) Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of land, building and machinery and\nequipment used in the design and development of products, and is stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation on building\nand machinery and equipment commences when the asset is ready for its intended use. Except\nfor the following paragraph, depreciation is primarily calculated on the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives of related assets which range as follows: building 25 years,\nbuilding improvements 4 to 16 years, machinery 4 to 10 years, research and development\nequipment 2 to 6 years, office furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years, others 2 to 10 years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease\nterm or the estimated useful life of the asset. Embedded software is amortized on a straight-\nline basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives,\nthen they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and\nequipment.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nDuring the year 2017, certain new machinery and equipment have been acquired for specific\nproject. The depreciation on these new assets is calculated on Fixed-Percentage-on-\nDeclining-Base Method basis over the estimated useful lives of 3 years. The Company thinks\nthat method would most closely reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future\neconomic benefits embodied in those assets.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date\nand adjusted if appropriate.\n(j) Leases\na. Identifying a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset, and the supplier does not have a\nsubstantive right to substitute the asset; and\n(ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from\nuse of the identified asset throughout the period of use; and\n(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the\nperiod of use.\nb. As a lessee\nPayments for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases are recognized as expenses\non a straight-line basis during the lease term for which the recognition exemption is\napplied. Except for leases described above, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability shall\nbe recognized for all other leases at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease\ncommencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the\nlease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company\ndetermines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various\nexternal financing sources. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which\ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made\nat or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial\ndirect costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring the underlying\nasset.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nshorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term. The lease liability is\nsubsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured (i) if there is a change in the lease term; (ii) if there is a change in future lease\npayments arising from a change in an index or a rate; (iii) if there is a change in the\namounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or (iv) if the Company\nchanges its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination\noption. When the lease liability is remeasured in the circumstances aforementioned, a\ncorresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\nHowever, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero, any\nremaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n(i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments.\n(ii) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise and lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is\nreasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\nMoreover, the lease liability is remeasured when lease modifications occur that decrease\nthe scope of the lease. The Company accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability\nby decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full\ntermination of the lease and recognizes in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the\npartial or full termination of the lease.\nc. As a lessor\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an\noperating lease are added to the carrying amount of the asset leased.\n(k) Goodwill\nGoodwill is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net\nassets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated\nimpairment losses, if any.\nGoodwill from acquisition of Himax Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly Wisepal Technologies,\nInc., merged into Himax Technologies Limited on July 2, 2018) in 2007 amounting $26,846\nthousand has been assigned to Driver IC cash generating unit (“CGU”) and goodwill from\nacquisition of Himax Display (USA) Inc. in 2012 amounting $1,292 thousand has been\nassigned to WLO CGU because these CGUs are expected to benefit from the synergies of the\nbusiness combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. For the purpose of\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU\nthat are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount\nof a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets\nof the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment\nloss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for\ngoodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In\nassessing value in use which was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial\nbudgets covering the future five-year period with the terminal growth rate. The annual\ndiscount rate was 8.05% and 11.98% in its test of Goodwill impairment for Driver IC CGU\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, based on industry weighted average cost of\ncapital. The annual discount rate for WLO CGU was 13.33% and 15.34% as of December 31,\n2021 and 2022, respectively. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average\nTaiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.46% and\n2.18% used in the test for both CGUs as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. The\nkey assumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the\nrelated industry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\n(l) Other Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets include patents, intellectual property and developed technology\nacquired in a business combination. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over the following estimated useful lives: software 2-10 years, patents 12-15 years,\nintellectual property 10 years and technology 7 years.\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date\nand adjusted if appropriate.\n(m) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company’s long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets, are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there\nis any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable\namount is estimated.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Considering the\nterminal growth rate if non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life are allocated to the\nCGU in comparison with its carrying amount.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that\nare largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-\ngenerating unit, or CGU”).\nThe annual discount rate was 11.40% in its test of non-financial assets impairment with an\nindefinite useful life for CMOS CGU as of December 31, 2021, based on industry weighted\naverage cost of capital. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average Taiwan\neconomic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.46% used in the test\nas of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions abovementioned represents the\nmanagement’s forecast of the future for the related industry by considering the history\ninformation from internal and external sources.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. When an\nimpairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU is increased\nto the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not\nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nIFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with\ncustomers, using a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount\nof revenue recognized. The Company generates revenue primarily from sale of goods or\nservices. Revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by primarily geographical\nmarket and major products.\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company identifies the contract with the customers and recognizes\nrevenue when performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled in\nthe transfer of goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it\nsatisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a\ncustomer. Customers obtain control of the product when the goods are delivered and accepted\nby customers. Invoices are generated at that point in time.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition from product sales is measured at the amount that is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized\nwill not occur. Revenue is reduced for estimated rebates and other similar allowances.\nTrade receivable is recognized when the Company is entitled for unconditional right to\nreceive payment upon delivery of goods to customers. The consideration received in advance\nfrom the customer but without delivery of goods is recognized as a contract liability, for which\nrevenue is recognized when the control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nThe Company expects that the length of time when the Company transfers the goods or\nservices to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be less\nthan one year. Therefore, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the time value of\nmoney.\n(o) Employee Benefits\n1. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed unless another policy allows or requires it to\nbe capitalized. Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are\nmeasured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for\nservice rendered by employees.\n2. Share-based payment arrangements\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for share-based compensation is\nmeasured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments issued. The\ncost of employee services is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to\nemployees and is recognized in earnings with a corresponding increase in equity over the\nservice period by graded vesting. Compensation cost also considers the number of\nawards management believes will eventually vest. As a result, compensation cost is\nreduced by the estimated forfeitures. The estimate is adjusted each period to reflect the\ncurrent estimate of forfeitures, and finally, the actual number of awards that vest.\n3. Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nemployee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are\nrendered by employees.\n4. Defined benefit plans\nThe Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated\nseparately for each benefit plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the\nfair value of any plan assets. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of\nproviding benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit costs\n(including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit\nretirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service\ncost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability\n(asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in profit or loss in the period they\noccur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan\nassets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is\nreflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(p) Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in profit or loss\nexcept to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in\nequity or in other comprehensive income.\n1. Current tax\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or\nlosses for the year and any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous\nyears. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted tax rate at the\nreporting date.\n2. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences\nattributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities\nin the financial statements and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit\ncarry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities\nof a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment\ndate. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent\nthat it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions\nare reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n(q) Business Combinations\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-\nrelated costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as\nthe excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in\nthe acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired\nand the liabilities assumed. Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-\ncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net\nassets.\nAny contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the\ncontingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is\naccounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration are recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and the resulting\ngain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(r) Earnings Per Ordinary Share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is computed using profit or loss attributable to the\nshareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of\nordinary and diluted ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary\nequivalent shares are ordinary shares that are contingently issuable upon the vesting of\nunvested restricted share units (RSUs) and employee stock options granted to employees.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nProfits attributable to Himax Technologies, Inc.\nstockholders (in thousands) $ 47,134 436,896 236,982\nDenominator for basic earnings per ordinary\nshare:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding (in thousands) 345,708 349,228 349,448\nBasic earnings per ordinary share attributable to\nHimax Technologies, Inc. stockholders $ 0.14 1.25 0.68\nBasic earnings per ADS attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders(1) $ 0.27 2.50 1.36\nContingently issuable ordinary shares underlying the unvested RSUs and employee stock\noptions granted to employees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary\nshare based on treasury stock method.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nProfits attributable to Himax Technologies, Inc.\nstockholders (in thousands) $ 47,134 436,896 236,982\nDenominator for diluted earnings per ordinary\nshare:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding (in thousands) 345,708 349,228 349,448\nUnvested RSUs (in thousands) - 505 187\nEmployee stock options (in thousands) 1,058 - -\n346,766 349,733 349,635\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share attributable\nto Himax Technologies, Inc. stockholders $ 0.14 1.25 0.68\nDiluted earnings per ADS attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders(1) $ 0.27 2.50 1.36\nNote (1): As the Company’s ordinary shares have been quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select\nMarket under the symbol “HIMX” in the form of ADSs and two ordinary shares\nrepresent one ADS with effect from August 10, 2009. The number of ADS\nequivalent outstanding is determined by dividing the number of ordinary shares by\ntwo. Therefore, the weighted average number of ADS equivalent outstanding used\nin basic earnings per ADS for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is 172,854 thousand, 174,614\nthousand and 174,724 thousand, respectively. Additionally, the weighted average\nnumber of ADS equivalent outstanding used in diluted earnings per ADS for 2020,\n2021 and 2022 is 173,383 thousand, 174,867 thousand and 174,817 thousand,\nrespectively. The earnings per ADS is presented solely for the convenience of the\nreader and does not represent a measure under IFRS.\n(s) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses. All operating segments’ operating results are\nreviewed regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for\nwhich discrete financial information is available.\nThe Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who regularly\nreviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing\nperformance for the Company. Management has determined that the Company has two\noperating segments: Driver IC and Non-driver products.\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on segment sales and\nsegment profit and loss. There are no intersegment sales in the segment revenues reported to\nthe CODM. Segment profit and loss is determined on a basis that is consistent with how the\nCompany reports operating income (loss) in its consolidated statements of operations.\nSegment profit (loss) excludes income taxes and items in non-operating income (loss).\nThe Company does not report segment asset information to the Company’s CODM.\nConsequently, no asset information by segment is presented.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n(t) Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are classified in the consolidated statements of profit or loss as part\nof profit (loss) for the period and the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part\nof equity in the consolidated statements of financial position. If a change in ownership of a\nconsolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership\ninterests are re-measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings.\n(u) Use of Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in\nany future periods affected.\nInformation about critical judgments, estimates and assumptions in applying accounting\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements is included in the following notes:\n1. Valuation of inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses\njudgment and estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of\neach reporting period.\nDue to the rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value\nof inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and\nthen writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value\nof the inventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a\nspecific time horizon.\n2. Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of non-financial assets other than\ngoodwill, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\nindependent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the\nspecific asset groups. Any changes in these estimates based on changed economic\nconditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or\nreversal in future years.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\n3. Recognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable\nprofits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized.\nAssessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires the Company’s subjective\njudgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, the sources\nof taxable income, the amount of tax credits that can be utilized and feasible tax planning\nstrategies. Changes in the economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws\nand regulations may result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n4. Impairment of goodwill\nThe assessment of impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make subjective\njudgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and\nestimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating the\nrecoverable amount of relevant CGU, the Company is required to make subjective\njudgments in determining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent\ncash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nNote 5. Acquisition\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company infused cash of $6,680 thousand into CMVT in exchange for\n66.71% of the outstanding common shares of CMVT. Acquisition-related costs, which were\ncharged to expense as incurred, were insignificant.\nCMVT is a Taiwan company dedicated to the development and production of Omniwide film for\ndisplay with its own technology: ultra view switching. As a result of the acquisition, the Company\nis expected to further strengthen the Company’s competitiveness in the displays with the addition\nof technology resources.\nThe results of CMVT’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements since that date. The amounts of CMVT’s revenues and losses included in the\nconsolidated statements of profit or loss from the acquisition date to the period ended December\n31, 2020 were $1,231 thousand and $214 thousand, respectively. If the acquisition had occurred\non January 1, 2020, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been $891,038\nthousand (unaudited), and consolidated profit for the year would have been $46,361 thousand\n(unaudited). In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value\nadjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had\noccurred on January 1, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Disposal of subsidiary\nThe Company had disposed its 100% shareholdings in EMZA to a third party with a consideration\nof $15,092 thousand netting disposal related cost in October 2022. The Company derecognized\nEMZA from the date of disposal as its subsidiary. The Company derecognized the assets, liabilities\nand the related equity components of EMZA, and recognized a gain on disposal of $10,694\nthousand, and recorded it as other income.\nThe carrying amount of assets and liabilities of EMZA on the date of disposal was as follow:\nEMZA\n(in thousands)\nCash $ 323\nCurrent assets, other than cash 2,241\nProperty, plant and equipment 179\nOther intangible assets 4,436\nOther non-current assets 587\nOther current and non-current liabilities (4,148)\nNet assets disposed of $ 3,618\nNote 7.

Sensitivity analysis\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises from the translation of the\nforeign currency exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, other receivable, accounts payable, other payable and lease liabilities that are\ndenominated in foreign currency.\nDepreciation or appreciation of the USD by 10% against the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD),\nCNY and JPY at December 31, 2021 and 2022, while all other variables were remained\nconstant, would have increased or (decreased) the net profit before tax of $11,523\nthousand and $7,801 thousand, respectively.\niii. Interest rate risk\nThe Company’s short-term secured borrowings and long-term unsecured borrowings\ncarried floating interest rates and fixed interest rates. The Company’s exposure to\nchanges in interest rates is mainly from floating-rate borrowings. Any change in interest\nrates will cause the effective interest rates of borrowings to change and thus cause the\nfuture cash flows to fluctuate over time.\nThe following sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to interest rate\nrisk. For floating-rate debts, the analysis assumes that the balances of outstanding debts\nat the end of the reporting period had been outstanding for the entire year.\nFor the Company’s floating-rate debts, assuming all other variables were remained\nconstant, an increase or a decrease in the interest rate by 0.25% would have resulted in a\ndecrease or an increase in the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31,\n2021 and 2022 by $131 thousand and $116 thousand, respectively.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Financial Risk Management\n(a) Overview\nThe Company is exposed to the following risks due to usage of financial instruments:\n(1) Credit risk\n(2) Liquidity risk\n(3) Market risk\nHereinafter discloses information about the Company’s exposure to variable risks, and the\ngoals, policies and procedures of the Company’s risk measurement and risk management.\n(b) Risk management framework\nManagement of related divisions are appointed to review, control, trace and monitor the\nstrategic risks, financial risks and operational risks faced by the Company. Management\nreports to executive officers the progress of risk controls from time to time and, if necessary,\nreport to the board of directors, depending on the extent of impact of risks.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a\nfinancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposures to\ncredit risk are primarily from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost and\naccounts receivable.\nThe Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with various reputable financial\ninstitutions. Financial assets at amortized cost are time deposits with original maturities of\ngreater than three months. The Company has not experienced any material losses on deposits\nof the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at amortized cost.\nManagement performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial\ninstitutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Management\nbelieves that there is a limited concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalent and\nfinancial assets at amortized cost.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nThe Company derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of display drivers that are\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions and subject to price fluctuations. Management\ncontinuously evaluates and controls the credit quality, credit limit and financial strength of its\ncustomers to ensure any overdue receivables are taken necessary procedures.\nThe Company depends on two customers for majority of its revenues. The Company’s sales\nto these two customers as a percentage of revenues are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2021 2022\nCustomer A and its affiliates 32.6% 32.1% 32.3%\nCustomer C 12.7% 19.1% 9.4%\nThe percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable accounted by customers, those\nrepresenting more than 10% of total accounts receivable balance, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2021 2022\nCustomer A and its affiliates 39.0% 31.5%\nCustomer C 12.1% 10.3%\nRefer to Note 11 for aging analysis of accounts receivable and the movement in the loss\nallowance.\nIn addition, the Company has at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of its\ncustomers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment terms, and the\nCompany may grant such requests for extension in the future. As a result, a default by any\nsuch customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable, or the extension of\npayment terms for the Company’s customers could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow,\nliquidity and operating results. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of each\ncustomer and adjusts credit policy based upon payment history and the customer’s credit\nworthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity\nto fund its business requirements associated with existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThe Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate working capital and unused\ncredit facilities.\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s working capital together with existing unused credit\nfacilities under its existing loan agreements will be sufficient to fulfill all of its contractual\nobligations. Therefore, management believes that there is no liquidity risk resulting from\nincapable of financing to fulfill the contractual obligations.\n(e) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and\ninterest rates, will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial\ninstruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n(1) Currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on operating activities that are denominated\nin a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Company, the USD.\nThe currencies used in these transactions are the NTD, CNY and JPY.\n(2) Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its outstanding\nborrowings. The Company’s borrowings carried floating interest rates. To manage the\ninterest rate risk, the Company periodically assesses the interest rates of bank loans and\nmaintains good relationships with financial institutions to obtain lower financing costs.\nThe Company also strengthens the management of working capital to reduce the\ndependence on bank loans as well as the risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\nNote 25. Capital management\nThrough clear understanding and managing of significant changes in external environment, related\nindustry characteristics, and corporate growth plan, the Company manages its capital structure in\na manner to ensure it has sufficient financial resources to fund its working capital needs, capital\nexpenditures, research and development activities, dividend payments and other business\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.

          "content": "2021 Annual Report\nDear Shareholders,\nReflecting on 2021, it was an unprecedented year highlighted by strong business momentum leading to\nrecord-breaking sales and profit for Himax. Our tremendous success was derived from macro level tailwinds,\nstrategically secured foundry capacity, a steadfast focus on optimizing product mix and solidification of key\ncustomer relationships. While the ongoing pandemic coupled with supply constraints did create a challenging\noperating environment, it was also one that was favorable for IC vendors such as ourselves. The record gross\nmargin we achieved was a reflection of favorable IC pricing, improved product mix and increased contribution\nfrom high margin product lines amidst tight foundry capacity.\nNow to briefly review the year for each of our major business segments.\nAmong our three major DDIC product categories, small and medium-sized display drivers posted the highest\ngrowth in 2021 where we enjoyed extraordinary business momentum, particularly in automotive and tablet\nareas. Our automotive IC sales grew more than 110%, the fastest of all product lines in 2021. Robust demand\nfor our traditional automotive driver IC was backed by strong foundry capacity support while automotive\nTDDI, where Himax is the industry front runner, saw accelerating project design-wins. We lead the market\nwith hundreds of TDDI design-wins already secured with world leading panel makers, Tier-1s and major\nautomotive OEMs with just a small portion of them currently in mass production. We are well positioned in\nterms of foundry capacity and expect automotive TDDI to outgrow DDIC and become a major growth engine\nfor us going forward. On the back of the remarkable growth of 2021, we believe our automotive sales will\ndouble again in 2022 with automotive becoming our top sales contributor.\nAs the dominant tablet driver IC supplier for literally all non-iOS tablet vendors, our TDDI solutions gained\ntraction broadly in customers’ next generation tablet products leading to 8 consecutive quarters of growth since\ninitial production in the first quarter of 2020. We continue to reap the benefits of the acceleration in TDDI\npenetration for tablets following surging demand for larger sized displays, higher frame rate and active stylus\nfeatures. As tablet and smartphone share the same foundry process pool, we strategically allocated capacity in\nfavor of tablet given our dominant position. Consequently, our smartphone shipments have been capped by the\ntotal capacity accessible to us and only in support of select end customers. Yet smartphone sales still enjoyed\ndecent growth in 2021.\nFor our large display driver business, ongoing work-from-home and e-learning boosted both our monitor and\nnotebook display IC sales in 2021, whereas TV sales also increased on a year over year basis despite the dip\nin worldwide TV shipments during the second half of the year. We continue to position our product lineups\ntowards high frame rate and high resolution technologies to fulfill end customers’ pursuit of visual enjoyment.\nWe also continued to increase market penetration with our integrated solution of high-end Tcon and drivers into\n4K/8K TV, gaming monitor and low power notebook markets.\nFor OLED display, Himax continued to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC and Tcon development in\npartnership with major Chinese and Korean panel makers in various applications. We commenced with\nproduction of a flexible AMOLED total solution for a customer’s flagship EV model at the end of 2021.\nOur AMOLED for tablet entered into mass production in early 2022, where we provide both AMOLED\ndriver and Tcon as the sole supplier for a leading tablet customer. For smartphone, we expect larger sales\ncontribution starting in 2023 and have secured meaningful capacity fully booked up by leading panel makers.\nOur non-driver IC business made healthy strides during 2021. Tcon sales more than doubled amidst the\ngrowing demand for high frame rate and high-resolution displays in 4K/8K TV, high frame rate gaming\nmonitor, low power notebook, and local dimming Tcon for automotive. Meanwhile, we are highly encouraged\nby the success we have made with our ultralow power AI image sensing technology that incorporates\nHimax’s proprietary AI processor, always-on CMOS image sensor, and visual sensing tinyML AI algorithm.\nOur AI image sensing was adopted in a range of new notebook models from Dell where our solution\ncommenced production during the end of 2021. Additionally, we engaged with various AI developers and SI\ncompanies to increase adoption of our AI solution in a broad range of applications including automatic meter\nreading, home appliances, automotive, panoramic video conferencing, and medical, among others, where\nsome of them are slated for production in 2022.\n1\nFinally, for our optical related businesses, WLO, LCoS and 3D sensing. The heightened interest in the\nmetaverse and immersive technologies has led to ongoing inquiries and collaborations with tech giants for\nthese three technologies in areas such as Front-Lit LCoS microdisplay for AR glasses, controller-free gesture\nrecognition, eye-tracking and 3D reconstruction for AR/VR devices.

Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\n3.C. Reason for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n3.D. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation, which could result\nin an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.\nThere may be industry consolidation among our suppliers. Merger and acquisition activities will likely increase\nthe size and market power of the relevant suppliers and reduce the number of suppliers we could use under a\nsimpler supplier chain. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer\ncontract terms, higher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could\nresult in an increase in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. If we are unable to transfer any increase in\naverage unit cost to our customers, our gross margin and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical\nand subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business\nor results of operations.\nIn 2020 and 2021, 85.2% and 88.0% of our revenues, respectively, were attributable to display drivers that\nwere incorporated into TFT-LCD panels. We expect to continue to substantially depend on sales to the TFT-LCD\npanel industry for the foreseeable future. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive and is vulnerable\nto cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD panels generally decline with time as a\nresult of, among other factors, drop in demand for end products that incorporate TFT LCD panels, new capacity\nramp-up or factory utilization improvement, technological advancements and cost reduction with the exception of\nthe new high end and high-resolution products.\nThe merger of certain of our major customers could result in an increase in their bargaining power and\ntherefore subject us to additional downward pricing pressure. We cannot assure you that in such periods in\nwhich we experience significant downward pricing pressure, we could sufficiently reduce costs to completely\noffset the loss of revenues. In addition, a severe and prolonged industry downturn could also result in\nhigher risks to the collectability of our accounts receivable, the marketability and valuation of inventories,\nthe impairment of our long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and\nintangible assets, and the stability of our supply chain. As a result, the cyclicality of the TFT-LCD panel\nindustry could adversely affect our revenues, cost of revenues and results of operations.\n10\nOur strategy of expanding our product offerings to non-driver products may not be successful.\nWe have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, financial and management resources to non-driver products’\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing to further diversify our product portfolio and improve gross margin\nas non-driver products may have higher gross margin than our driver products. Our non-driver technologies cover\nLCoS microdisplay, Always-on-Sensor (“AoS”) CMOS image sensor, wafer level optics (“WLO”), 3D sensing\nand ultralow power AI image sensing, etc.\nFor our LCoS technology, at present our main focus areas for LCoS business are AR goggle devices and\nhead-up-displays (HUD) for automotive. AoS CMOS image sensor is a specific sensor which consumes only\nseveral micro watts to perform people detection, eyeball tracking and other features. The new sensor architectures,\nreadout, pixel, and the corresponding slim algorithms are integrated together to contribute the always-on feature.\nFor smartphone 3D sensing, we aggressively work with our partners from VCSEL, sensor, module and OEM\nfields, jointly participate in major ongoing Android smartphone projects covering time-of-flight (ToF) for\nworld-facing camera. On non-smartphone 3D-sensing, with our Structured Light 3D SLiM solution and 3D\ndecoder ASIC key component, we aim at emerging markets such as smart door lock, facial recognition-based\ne-payment, business access control, biomedical inspection device and eye-tracking applications. For our ultralow\npower AI image sensing solution, we focus on providing leading edge AI solutions, in both total solution and\ndiscrete key component, to meet diversified customer and application needs. Himax’s ultralow power AI image\nsensing solution integrates in-house AoS sensor, proprietary edge AI processor and AI-based algorithm from third\nparty or Emza, one of Himax’s subsidiaries. Our AI image sensing solution is growing quickly in a broad range of\napplications, covering notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery-powered surveillance camera,\npanoramic video conferencing, and medical. In addition, we also collaborate closely with edge-to-cloud platform\npartners in areas such as smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation.\nDeveloping and commercializing each of our non-driver products requires a significant amount of\nmanagement, engineering and monetary resources. For example, we have established certain in-house\nfacilities for key manufacturing processes of our non-driver products including LCoS microdisplay, WLO\nand 3D sensing. Numerous uncertainties exist in developing new products and we cannot assure you that we\nwill be able to develop our non-driver products successfully. We may underestimate the amount of capital,\npersonnel and other resources required to develop and commercialize our non-driver products. We may also\noverestimate the market potential of the end products that are utilizing or will utilize our non-driver products.\nThe failure or delay in the development, production or commercialization of any of our non-driver products,\nthe occurrence of any product defects or design flaws, or the low market acceptance of or demand for either\nof our products or the end devices using our products may adversely affect the impairment of our long-term\nnon-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, for non-driver\nproducts, our results of operations and growth prospects. The lower capacity utilization rate of our factories\nwill negatively affect our gross margin and our results of operations. Moreover, we will be subject to higher\nramp-up expenses in the early stage of mass production of our non-driver products.\nThe concentration of our revenues and accounts receivable and the extension of payment terms for certain of\nour customers exposes us to increased credit risk and could harm our operating results and cash flows.\nIn 2021, Customer A and its affiliates accounted for 32.1% of our revenues. Our two largest customers\ntogether accounted for over 50% of our revenues in 2021. See “Item 5.A. Operating Results—Description\nof Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items—Revenues” for our revenues description. Our results of\noperations and financial condition would be significantly linked to the success and purchase policy of any\nsuch customer. As of December 31, 2021, our accounts receivable from Customer A and its affiliates were\n$160.1 million, which represented approximately 39.0% of our accounts receivable, net. The concentration\nof our accounts receivable exposes us to increased credit risk. Moreover, we have at times agreed to extend\nthe payment terms for certain of our customers. As a result, any loss of or a sharp reduction in any such\ncustomer’s sales, a default by any such customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable\nor the extension of payment terms for our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our\noperating results.\nOur customers may experience a decline in profitability or may not be profitable at all, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTFT-LCD panel manufacturers, including our customers, experience significant pressure on prices and profit\nmargins, due largely to growing industry capacity and fluctuations in demand for TFT-LCD panels. Some panel\n11\nmanufacturers have greater access to capital or greater production, research and development, intellectual\nproperty, marketing or other resources than our customers, who may not be able to compete and sustain their\nmarket positions. Further, our customers’ business performance may fluctuate significantly due to a number\nof factors, many of which are beyond their control, including and not limited to: (1) consumer demand and\nthe general economic conditions, such as recent geopolitical tensions relating to invasion of Ukraine by\nRussia; (2) the cyclical nature of the TFT-LCD industry in average selling price fluctuations, as well as its\ndownstream industries; (3) the speed at which TFT-LCD panel manufacturers expand production capacity; (4)\nbrand companies’ continued needs for original equipment manufacturing services provided by TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers; (5) access to raw materials, components, equipment and utilities on a timely and economical\nbasis; (6) technological changes; (7) the rescheduling and cancellation of large orders; (8) access to funding on\nsatisfactory terms; and (9) fluctuations in the currencies of TFT-LCD panels exporting countries against the U.S.\ndollar.\nWe depend on sales of display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, and the limited potential for further growth in\nboth the market size of display drivers and the market share of our display drivers or the absence of continued\nmarket acceptance of our display drivers could limit our growth in revenues or harm our business.\nIn 2020 and 2021, 85.2% and 88.0% of our revenues, respectively, from the sale of display drivers used\nfor large, small and medium-sized applications, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of\nour revenues from these or related products. As the display driver industry is relatively mature, there may be\nlimited potential for the overall display drivers market to grow and for us to further grow our market share and\nrevenues.\nFailure to grow our unit shipments for display drivers, coupled with a general decline in the average\nselling prices, could adversely and materially affect our results of operations. See also “—Risks Relating\nto Our Industry—The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively\nimpact our revenues and operating results”. Therefore, the continued market acceptance of our display\ndrivers is critical to our future success. Failure to grow or maintain our revenues generated from the sales of\ndisplay drivers could adversely and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to public health epidemics, including the recent novel coronavirus outbreaks.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic\ninterferes with our ability, or that of our employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners to\nperform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations related to the conduct of our business. Since\nNovember 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) has spread across the world. To date, the Covid-19\noutbreak has caused significant disruption to the financial markets and international supply chains, which can\nsubstantially depress global business activities, restrict access to capital and result in a long-term economic\ndownturn that would negatively affect our operating results.\nAs a result of the pandemic, numerous unprecedented measures are in place to try to contain the virus,\nsuch as travel restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These\nmeasures may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and suppliers.\nThe ultimate impact and efficacy of measures and potential future measures is currently unknown. We\nhave experienced and will experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines,\nself-isolations, or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our\nability to develop and design our products in a timely manner. Our suppliers, sub-contractors and customers\nhave been and will be disrupted by quarantines and social distancing measures, office and factory closures,\ndisruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel-related restrictions.\nDepending on the magnitude of such effects on our suppliers’ manufacturing, assembling, and testing\noperations, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely\naffect our business, operations and customer relationships.\nWe had a strong financial performance in 2021 despite the ongoing effects of the pandemic, coupled\nwith foundry capacity shortages. Yet, those conditions also provided favorable conditions for IC\nvendors such as us, with overall market demand far outpacing supply. The gross margin year-over-year\nimprovement was mainly a reflection of more favorable IC pricing resulted from the tight foundry capacity\nand product mix derived from high margin product lines on top of rising material costs across foundry,\nassembly and testing, of which all undergoing severe capacity shortages. Under limited capacity situation,\nwe are unable to meet all demands, and strategically allocate our limited capacity toward the products\nwith better margins. However, with a growing number of vaccinations or after the pandemic is over, the\nsurge demand, the better pricing, the more favorable product mix as well as the better gross margin we\n12\ncurrently enjoy may fade away or decrease progressively, which could materially and adversely affect\nour results of operations and financial condition.\nExtra export license may be needed for certain product or technology for certain customers. These licenses are\nregulated by Export Administration Regulations (EAR) which is administered by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\nOur business is subject to various international laws and legal requirements from the U.S. Export\nAdministration Regulations and other jurisdictions’ applicable executive orders in packaging, product content,\nlabor and import/export regulations, etc. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and\nwith limited notice, have generally become more rigorous and have intensified under the current U.S. administration,\nespecially in recent geopolitical tensions with China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply\nwith, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations\nor our customers are sanctioned, or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may be required to suspend sales to\nthese customers, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our results of operations. If\nour foundry, tape, assembly and testing suppliers fail to comply with these regulations or our suppliers are sanctioned\nor added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may suspend their services and have to obtain alternative services in\na timely manner. Considering the amount of time, it usually takes to qualify assembly and testing houses, we may\nexperience significant delays in product shipments. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or\ncost of our products could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the scarcity\nand importance of services may necessitate us making investments in foundry, tape, assembly and testing service\nproviders in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly\nraise additional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nTechnological innovation may reduce the number of display drivers typically required for each panel, thereby\nreducing the number of display drivers we are able to sell per panel. If such a reduction in demand is not offset\nby the general growth of the industry, our market share or average selling prices, or our revenues may decline.\nIn order to reduce costs, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers generally seek to have display drivers with higher\nchannel counts and new panel designs to reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel. We have\nbeen developing such innovative and cost-effective display driver solutions in order to grow our market share,\nattract additional customers, increase our average selling prices and capture new design wins. However, we cannot\nassure you that we will successfully achieve these goals. If we fail to do so and the number of display drivers\ntypically required per panel decreases thereby reducing our unit shipments, our revenues may decline. TFT-LCD\npanel manufacturers have developed several panel designs to reduce the usage of display drivers, including gate in\npanel, or GIP, amorphous silicon gate, or ASG, or simply gateless designs, which integrate the gate driver function\nonto the glass and eliminate the need for gate drivers, as well as dual gate and triple gate panel designs, which\nwould largely reduce the usage of source drivers. If such designs or technologies become widely adopted, demand\nfor our display drivers may decrease significantly, which would adversely and materially affect our results of\noperations.\nThe strategic relationships between certain of our competitors and their customers and the development of\nin-house capabilities by TFT-LCD and AMOLED panel manufacturers may limit our ability to expand our\ncustomer base and our growth prospects.\nCertain of our competitors have established or may establish strategic or strong relationships with TFT-LCD\npanel manufacturers that are also our existing or potential customers. Marketing our display drivers to such\nTFT-LCD panel manufacturers that have established relationships with our competitors may be difficult.\nMoreover, several TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have in-house design capabilities and therefore may not need\nto source semiconductor products from us. If our customers successfully develop in-house capabilities to design\nand develop semiconductors that can substitute for our products, they would likely reduce or stop purchasing our\nproducts. To sell new products, we will likely need to target new market segments and new customers with whom\nwe do not have current relationships, which may require different strategies and may present difficulties that\nwe have not encountered before. Failure to broaden our customer base and attract new customers may limit our\ngrowth prospects.\nAs AMOLED offer brighter color, near-perfect-black, less power consumption and are thinner and lighter\nthan TFT-LCD, it gradually penetrates the mid to high-end TFT-LCD market, especially the smartphone market.\nAMOLED display and related DDICs have been dominated by Korean companies. The marketplace is increasing\nutilization of the AMOLED display for smartphone and other consumer electronics due to expanded AMOLED\ncapacity. We continue to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC development in partnership with major Chinese and\n13\nKorean panel makers. In the first quarter of 2022, our flexible AMOLED driver and Tcon for automotive application\nhas successfully ramped up for a customer’s flagship EV model. In addition, our AMOLED for tablet is expected to\ncommence mass production in 2022 with Chinese panel makers. As for smartphone, we continue to commit R&D\nresources to AMOLED driver ICs through engagement with top tier customers. However, we could not assure you\nthe success of our AMOLED driver IC as we are unable to penetrate into the mass volume existing Korean supplier\nchain and/or find new AMOLED panel manufactures to design-wins our solutions into. AMOLED process maturity\nfor the new manufactures and the possible specification change due to the immaturity of the AMOLED will also be a\nhurdle to our AMOLED share gain and success.\nWe depend primarily on third-party foundries to manufacture our wafers, and any failure to obtain sufficient\nfoundry capacity or loss of any of the foundries we use could significantly delay our ability to ship our products,\ncausing us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nAccess to foundry capacity is crucial to our business because we do not manufacture our own wafers, instead\nrelying primarily on third-party foundries. The ability of a foundry to manufacture our semiconductor products\nis limited by its available capacity. Access to capacity is especially important due to the limited availability of\nthe high-voltage CMOS process technology required for the manufacture of wafers used in display drivers. If\nthe primary third-party foundries that we rely upon are not able to meet our required capacity, or if our business\nrelationships with these foundries are adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity to\nmeet increasing demand for our products. We may have to seek alternative foundries, which may not be available\non commercially reasonable terms, or which may expose us to qualifying-new-foundry risks, as further discussed\nbelow.\nWe use several foundries for different semiconductor products, and certain of our products are manufactured at\nonly one of these foundries. If any one of the foundries is unable to provide the required capacity to us, or does not\ndeliver in a timely manner, or the quality or pricing terms are not acceptable to us, or any of the foundries experience\nfinancial difficulties or insolvency risks due to the impact of the global economic turmoil or any company-specific\nreasons or otherwise, if their operations are damaged or if there is any other disruption, directly or indirectly, of their\nfoundry operations and we cannot qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner, we could experience significant\ndelays in receiving the product being manufactured by that foundry or incur additional costs to obtain substitutes,\nor interruption in our supply of the affected products. If we choose to use a new foundry or process technology for\na particular semiconductor product, it will take us several quarters to qualify the new foundry or process before we\ncan begin shipping. If we cannot qualify a new foundry in a timely manner, we may experience and incur damages\nas above mentioned and harm our customer relationships.\nAs a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of our wafers, we face several significant risks, including: (1)\nfailure to secure manufacturing capacity, or being able to obtain required capacity only at higher costs; (2) risks of\nour proprietary information leaking to our competitors through the foundries we use; (3) limited control of delivery\nschedules, quality assurance and control, manufacturing yields and wafer costs; (4) the unavailability of, or potential\ndelays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and (5) financial risks of certain of our foundry suppliers.\nTo manufacture our display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, we require foundries with high-voltage CMOS\nmanufacturing process capacity. As a result, our dependence on high-voltage CMOS foundries presents the\nfollowing, additional risks: (1) potential capacity constraints faced by the limited number of high-voltage CMOS\nfoundries and the lack of investment in new and existing high-voltage CMOS foundries; (2) difficulty in attaining\nconsistently high manufacturing yields from high-voltage CMOS foundries; (3) delay and time required to qualify\nand ramp up production at new high-voltage CMOS foundries; and (4) price increases.\nAs a result, we may be required to use foundries with which we have no established relationships, which could\nexpose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover,\nthe scarcity of high-voltage foundry capacity may necessitate us making investments in foundries in order to\nsecure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional\ncapital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nSince 2020, due to the pandemic lockdown, the work-from-home and learn-from-home new lifestyles triggered\nincreasing demands for display and display drivers related products. The surging demand in display drivers caused the\nsevere foundry capacity shortage, while the industry has no major expansion plan especially on the mature nodes we are\nprimarily anchored to. To address the continuing foundry capacity shortage worldwide, we have entered into strategic\nagreements with our foundry partners in order to secure capacity to fulfill our business needs. We expect to enter into\n14\nmore additional strategic agreements to secure additional foundry capacity. Under these strategic agreements, we are\ncommitted to purchasing a specific volume at fixed or variable prices. However, for both pricing agreements, there can\nbe no assurance that these prices provided in the strategic agreements with our foundry partners will always remain\ncompetitive during the contract term. For example, in the event that the global semiconductor market changes due to\nfoundry capacity expansion and/or shrunken customer demand, the fixed prices we agree to pay our foundry partners\nmay become significantly higher than the then prevailing market price. The situation could materially adversely\nimpact our pricing strategies, competitive position, profitability and results of operation. We may also be subject\nto contractual penalties if we are unable to purchase the committed volume from our foundry partners. In addition,\nsince these strategic agreements with our foundry partners typically require us to make prepayments or refundable\ndeposits to such foundry partners, our cash flow, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to secure sufficient capacity from any of our third-party tape, assembly and testing houses at reasonable\nand competitive prices could disrupt our shipments, harm our customer relationships and reduce our sales.\nAccess to third-party tape, assembly and testing capacity is critical to our business because we do not have\nin-house tape, assembly and testing capabilities for commercial production and instead rely on third-party service\nproviders. Access to these services is especially important to our business because display drivers require specialized\ntape, assembly and testing services. A limited number of third-party tape, assembly and testing houses tape, assemble\nand test substantially all of our current products. There has been an increased level of industry consolidation among\nour suppliers in recent years. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer\ncontract terms, higher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could\nresult in an increase in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. We do not have binding long-term supply\narrangements with tape, assembly and testing service providers that guarantee us access to our required capacity.\nIf the primary tape, assembly and testing service providers that we rely upon are not able to meet our requirements\nin price, quality, and service, or if our business relationships with these service providers were adversely affected,\nwe would not be able to obtain the required capacity and would have to seek alternative providers, which may\nnot be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we do not directly control our product\ndelivery schedules, tape, assembly and testing costs, and quality assurance and control. If any of these third-party\ntape, assembly and testing houses experiences capacity constraints, financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its\nfacilities or if there is any disruption of its assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative\nassembly and testing services in a timely manner. Because of the amount of time, we usually take to qualify\nassembly and testing houses, we may experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find\nalternative sources. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could\ndamage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of tape,\nassembly and testing services may necessitate us making investments in tape, assembly and testing service providers\nin order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise\nadditional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of key components for our customers’ products could decrease demand for our products.\nShortages of components and other materials that are critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’\nproducts may limit our sales. These components and other materials include, but are not limited to, color filters,\nbacklight modules, polarizers, printed circuit boards and glass substrates. In the past, companies that use our\nproducts in their production have experienced delays in the availability of key components from other suppliers.\nIn addition, component manufacturers may not be able to increase or maintain their component supply because\nof labor shortage in China or otherwise and may shut down certain of their capacity from time to time because of\nweak demand, which may increase the instability of timely delivery and the risk of shortage of components. Such\nshortages of components and other materials critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’ products may\ncause a slowdown in demand for our products, resulting in a decrease in our sales and adversely affecting our results\nof operations. In addition, as a result of uncertain demand conditions, our customers may hesitate to build inventory\non hand and tend to release orders on short notice.\nWe rely on the services of our key personnel, and if we are unable to retain our current key personnel and hire\nadditional personnel, our ability to design, develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\nWe rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key personnel, including\nJordan Wu, our president and chief executive officer, and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu, our chairman, and certain engineering,\ntechnical and senior management personnel, in particular, who are critical to our corporate management, business\noperation strategy, operation execution, future technological and product innovations. Competition for these\n15\npersonnel is intense in the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. Moreover, our future success depends on the expansion\nof our senior management team and the retention of key employees. Any of our key employees could leave our\ncompany with little or no prior notice in applicable jurisdictions and could then work with a competitor. In addition,\nwe do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any key personnel\nor our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, whether engineers or others, could delay the development and\nintroduction of new products and would have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and may\nimpact our overall business and growth. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert\nthe attention of other senior executives away from their original duties to recruiting replacements for key personnel.\nIf we fail to forecast customer demand accurately, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may\nincrease our operating costs and harm our business.\nThe lead time required by the semiconductor manufacturing service providers is typically longer than the lead\ntime that our customers provide for delivery of our products to them. To ensure availability of our products for our\ncustomers, we will typically ask our semiconductor manufacturing service providers to start manufacturing our\nproducts based on forecasts provided by our customers in advance of receiving their purchase orders. However,\nthese forecasts are not binding purchase commitments, and we do not recognize revenues until they are delivered\nto customers. Moreover, for the convenience of our customers, we may agree to ship our inventory to warehouses\nlocated near our customers, so that our products can be delivered to customers more quickly. In such cases, we will\nnot recognize revenues until the control over a product is given to our customers based on the shipping terms. Hence,\nwe incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenues.\nThe anticipated demand for our products may not materialize; therefore, manufacturing based on customer\nforecasts exposes us to risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased product obsolescence, and erosion of the\nproducts’ market value. If we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments\ndelayed, we may incur excess inventory that we cannot sell, or may have to sell at low profit margins or even at a\nloss, which would harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have sufficient\ninventory and may lose market share and damage customer relationships, which also could harm our business. These\ninventory risks are exacerbated by the high level of customization of our products, which limits our ability to sell\nexcess inventory to other customers, which could eventually lead to write-down of these excess inventory.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future, our ability to grow will be limited.\nOur future success depends on our customers designing our products into their products. To achieve design wins,\nwe must design and deliver cost-effective, innovative, reliable and integrated products for our customers’ needs.\nA panel manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs and time\nassociated with qualifying a new supplier. A design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to purchase our\nproducts and may not result in large volume orders of our products. Rather, it is a decision by a customer to use our\nproducts in the design process of that customer’s products. Accordingly, our failure to successfully design, develop\nand introduce new products and product enhancements could harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur products are complex and may require modifications to resolve undetected errors or failures in order for\nthem to function with panels at the desired specifications, which could lead to higher costs, customer dispute,\na loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain undetected errors or failures. Our products must operate\naccording to specifications with the other components used by our customers in their product manufacturing process.\nIf our products are delivered with errors or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement\ncosts, and our credibility and the market acceptance of our products could be harmed along with possible liability\nindemnification for defective product, customer disputes and lawsuits against us or our customers.\n16\nOur highly integrated products are difficult to manufacture without defects. The existence of defects in our products\ncould increase our costs, decrease our sales and damage our customer relationships and our reputation.\nThe manufacture of our products that incorporate mixed analog and digital signal processing and embedded\nmemory technology is complex and it is difficult for semiconductor foundries to manufacture them completely\nwithout defects. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process could cause substantial reduction in yield and\nquality.\nDefective products can be caused by design, defective materials or component parts, or manufacturing\ndifficulties. Thus, quality problems can be identified only by analyzing and testing our display drivers in a system\nafter they have been manufactured. Difficulties in achieving defect-free products due to the increasing complexity\nof display drivers and the panel system may result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and delays in the\navailability of our products. In addition, if the foundries that we use fail to deliver products of satisfactory quality in\nthe volume and at the price required, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand or to sell those products at an\nacceptable profit margin, which could adversely affect our sales and margins and damage our customer relationships\nand our reputation.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant\nuncertainty and volatility with respect to our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers; our sales are made on the basis of\nindividual purchase orders. Our customers may also cancel or defer purchase orders. Our customers’ purchase\norders may vary significantly from period to period, and it is difficult to forecast future order quantities. In the\nevent of a cancellation, postponement, or reduction of an order, we would likely not be able to reduce operating\nexpenses sufficiently so as to minimize the impact of the lost revenues. Alternatively, we may have excess\ninventory that we cannot sell, which would harm our operating results. In addition, changes in our customers’\nbusiness may adversely affect the quantity of purchase orders that we receive by reducing or canceling their\norders of our products, and/or requesting higher-than-usual price concessions. We cannot assure you that any of\nour customers will continue to place orders with us in the future. We also cannot assure you that the volume of our\ncustomers’ orders will be consistent with our expectations when we plan our expenditures. Our results of operations\nand financial condition may thus be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, purchase order cancelations or\nnegative alternation by customers may lead to a reduction in future earnings or cash flows subject to each event.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by officers, directors and affiliated entities who may take\nactions that are not in, or may conflict with, our or our public shareholders’ interests.\nAs of February 28, 2022, Jordan Wu and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu (who are brothers) beneficially owned approximately\n2.1% and 21.5% of our ordinary shares, respectively. For information relating to the beneficial ownership of our\nordinary shares, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” These\nshareholders, acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders,\nincluding electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration\nof ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our\nshareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might\nreduce the price of our ADSs. Actions may be taken even if they were opposed by our other shareholders.\nAssertions against us by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights could result in significant\ncosts and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and\npositions, which results in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have received, and expect\nto continue to receive, notices of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. We may receive claims\nfrom various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property\nrights in the future. Any lawsuit resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages\nand invalidate our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be time-consuming\nand expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential intellectual property\nlitigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: (1) stop selling products or using technology or\nmanufacturing processes that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; (2) pay damages to the party\nclaiming infringement; (3) attempt to obtain a license for the relevant intellectual property, which may not be\n17\navailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all; and (4) attempt to redesign those products that contain the\nallegedly infringing intellectual property with non-infringing intellectual property, which may not be possible.\nThe outcome of a dispute may result in our need to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or\nlicensing agreements. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out\nof the sale of our products. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business,\noperating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the\nsuccess of our business. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyright\nlaws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual properties. These afford only limited protection. Despite\nour efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain, copy or use information\nthat we regard as proprietary, such as product design and manufacturing process expertise. Our pending patent\napplications and any future applications may not result in issued patents or may not be sufficiently broad to protect\nour proprietary technologies. Moreover, policing any unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we\ncannot be certain that the measures which we have implemented will prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use\nof our technologies, particularly in foreign jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully\nas the laws of the United States. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual properties or\notherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual properties. Our failure to protect our intellectual properties\neffectively could harm our business.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or investments to expand our business that may pose risks to our business and\ndilute the ownership of our existing shareholders, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these\nacquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire\nor invest in other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings,\nexpand the breadth of markets we can address or enhance our technical capabilities. Acquisitions or investments that\nwe have completed or potentially may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely\naffect our business, operating and financial results, including: (1) problems integrating the acquired key employees,\noperations, technologies or products into our existing business and products; (2) diversion of management’s time and\nattention from our core business; (3) adverse effects of losses of the acquired target upon our financial condition and\nresults of operations; (4) adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers; (5) the need for financial\nresources above our planned investment levels; (6) dilution of share ownership of current shareholders under share\nswap transactions; (7) risks associated with entering markets in which we lack experience; (8) potential write-offs of\nacquired assets; and (9) potential impairment charges related to the goodwill acquired.\nWe may also face challenges in international acquisitions, such as compliance with local law and regulation,\nlimited access to target companies and cultural assimilation challenges. Our failure to address these risks\nsuccessfully may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such\nacquisition or investment may require a significant amount of capital investment, which would decrease the amount\nof cash available for working capital or capital expenditures. In addition, if we use our equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions, the value of our ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares may be diluted. If we borrow funds to finance\nacquisitions, such debt instruments may contain restrictive covenants that can, among other things, restrict us from\ndistributing dividends.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches or unexpected system outage or failures could impact our\nbusiness.\nOur computer systems and networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other malicious attempts. The reliability and\nsafety of our information technology infrastructure / software, and the ability to continually expand and update\ntechnologies / software in response to dynamic changing needs and cybersecurity threats, are critical to our business.\nIn recent years, there are increasing and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers,\nstate-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human / technological errors. All of the\nabove could result in the loss of our intellectual property, the leak of commercially sensitive information, and the\nmisappropriation of confidential information of our employees, customers and suppliers, and therefore could cause\n18\nthe interruption of our business. Failures to protect the privacy of employees, customers or suppliers’ confidential\ndata against breaches of network security could result in the loss of existing or potential customers, other financial\nloss, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the operational cost and consequences against breaches and\nremedial measures could be significant. While we seek to annually review and assess our cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we still cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to\nnew and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As of February 28, 2022,\nwe had not been aware of any material cyberattacks or incidents that had or would be expected to have a materially\nadverse effect on our business and operations, nor had we been involved in any legal proceedings or regulatory\ninvestigations related thereto.\nOur data centers are subject to the risk of break-ins and sabotage. Our disaster recovery plan cannot account\nfor all eventualities. Consequently, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our\ndata centers could result in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business.\nSome of our system services are based on public cloud services, which are also subject to interruption due to cloud\nservice providers’ unexpected downtimes, cyberattacks or any type of failure, telecommunication failure and/or\nother unidentified problems while connecting to cloud. These cloud services interruptions could result in loss of\nproduction capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Cloud cybersecurity breaches could\nresult in adverse effects on our customers, employees, suppliers, reputation, and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our revenues\nand operating results.\nThe price of each semiconductor product typically declines over its product life cycle, reflecting product\nobsolescence, decreased demand as customers shift to more advanced products, decreased unit costs due to advanced\ndesigns or improved manufacturing yields, and increased competition as more semiconductor suppliers are able\nto offer similar products. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results if\nour average selling prices decline. We may reduce the average unit price of our products in response to competitive\npricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and other factors. We expect that these\nfactors will create downward pressure on our average selling prices and operating results. If we are unable to offset\nany reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost\nreductions, or if we fail to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis, our revenues\nand operating results will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly competitive,\nand we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors.\nIncreased competition in the semiconductor industry may result in pricing pressure, reduced profitability and\nloss of market share, any of which could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations. We continually\nface intense competition from fabless display driver companies and integrated device manufacturers. Some of\nour competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing,\nmarketing and distribution of their products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing\ncustomer demands or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products. Some of\nour competitors are affiliated with, or are subsidiaries of, our panel manufacturer customers. These relationships may\nalso give our competitors significant advantages such as early access to product roadmaps and design-in priorities,\nwhich would allow them to respond more quickly to changing customer demands and achieve more design-wins\nthan we can. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues and market share or\ncompete successfully against our competitors in the semiconductor industry.\n19\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to anticipate changes in evolving industry\nstandards, fail to achieve and maintain technological leadership in our industry or fail to develop and introduce\nnew and enhanced products.\nOur products are generally based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The emergence of new\nindustry standards could render our products or those of our customers unmarketable or obsolete and may require\nus to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any such new standards. Our past sales and profitability\nhave resulted, to a significant extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\nand to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely fashion. If we do not anticipate these changes\nin technologies and rapidly develop and introduce new and innovative technologies, we may not be able to provide\nadvanced display semiconductors on competitive terms, and some of our customers may buy products from our\ncompetitors instead of from us. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes and anticipate future standards will\nbe a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our growth prospects. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to anticipate evolving industry standards, successfully complete the design of our\nnew products, have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields, or obtain significant purchase\norders for these products to meet new standards or technologies. If we fail to anticipate changes in technology and\nto introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business and results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure\nOur ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial,\nstatutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments,\nmake acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist mainly of our 100% ownership interest in Himax Taiwan. We\nreceive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends\nin the past. Nonetheless, dividends and interest on shareholder loans that we receive from our subsidiaries in Taiwan,\nif any, will be subject to withholding tax under ROC law. The ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with loans,\npay dividends, repay any shareholder loans from us or make other distributions to us is restricted by, among other\nthings, the availability of funds, the terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as\nstatutory and other legal restrictions. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, pay dividends, and otherwise\nfund and conduct our business.\nPolitical, Geographical and Economic Risks\nWe operate primarily in Taiwan that are vulnerable to natural disasters.\nMost of our operations, and the operations of many of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers,\nsuppliers and customers are located in Taiwan, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, in particular, earthquakes and\ntyphoons. Our principal foundries, tape and assembly and testing houses upon which we have relied to manufacture\nsubstantially all of our display drivers are located in Taiwan. As a result of this geographic concentration, disruption\nof operations at our facilities or the facilities of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers and suppliers\nfor any reason, including work stoppages, power outages, water supply shortages, fire, typhoons, earthquakes or\nother natural disasters, could cause delays in production and shipments of our products. In addition, shortages or\ninterruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government,\nsuch as to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country. Any delays or disruptions could result in our customers seeking to\nsource products from our competitors. If such disruption of operation at our customers’ facilities and our customers\nmay be required to shut down temporarily or to substantially reduce the operations of their fabs, these would\nseriously affect demand for our products.\nDisruptions in Taiwan’s political environment could negatively affect our business and ADSs market price.\nOur principal executive offices and a substantial amount of our assets are located in Taiwan, and a substantial\nportion of revenues is derived from operations in Taiwan. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ADSs market price may be affected by changes in ROC policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, and by\nsocial instability and diplomatic issues that are outside of our control.\n20\nTaiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and the PRC have been separately\ngoverned. The government of the PRC claims that it is the sole government in China and that Taiwan is part of\nChina. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between\nTaiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has refused to renounce the possibility that it may at some point use force\nto gain control over Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC government adopted an anti-secession law relating to Taiwan.\nRelations between the ROC and the PRC governments have been strained in recent years for a variety of reasons,\nincluding the PRC government’s position on the “One China” policy and tensions concerning arms sales to Taiwan\nby the United States government. Any tension between the ROC and the PRC, or between the United States and the\nPRC, could materially and adversely affect our ADSs market prices.\nA substantial portion of our sales are made to customers in the PRC, which may expose us to additional political,\nregulatory, and economic risks.\nWe have been increasingly selling our products to customers in the PRC. In 2020 and 2021, approximately 79.7%\nand 81.5% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in the PRC. We expect to continue to\nincrease our sales to customers in the PRC in the future. With regional customer concentration, we are particularly\nsubject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in the PRC.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the\nstructure, level of government involvement, level of development, foreign exchange control and allocation of\nresources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy\nand is growing rapidly. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures\nemphasizing utilization of market forces in the development of the economy and also adjusted its macroeconomic\ncontrol policies from time to time. These policies have led and may continue to lead to changes in market\nconditions. Further, if new, US sanctions are imposed on China and any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations\nare implemented, or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes\nretaliatory trade actions due to recent U.S.-China trade tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our\ncustomers or suppliers in China. We cannot predict whether changes in the PRC’s political, economic and social\nconditions, laws, regulations and policies will have any adverse effect on our customers in the PRC. In addition, the\ninterpretation of PRC laws and regulations involves uncertainties. We cannot assure you that changes in such laws\nand regulations, or in their interpretation and enforcement, will not have a material adverse effect on the businesses\nand operations of our customers in the PRC and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and\noperations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses and affect our results of operations.\nOur functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. In 2021, more than 99% of our revenues and cost of\nrevenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency exposure and are primarily\naffected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar. This is because a majority\nportion of our employees and facilities are based in Taiwan and operating expenses are denominated in NT\ndollars and we maintain a portion of our cash in NT dollars for Taiwan working capital purposes. For example,\nin December 2021, approximately 67% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars, with a\nsmall percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel new shekel and Chinese Renminbi, and\nthe majority of the remainder in U.S. dollars. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in\nexchange rate of U.S. dollars against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT\ndollar, would have an adverse impact on our operating expenses as expressed in U.S. dollar and adversely affect\nour operating profit.\nChanges in ROC tax laws would likely increase our tax expenditures and decrease our net income.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and\ndevelopment expenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30%\nof the income tax payable for the current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute\nfor Industrial Innovation may not be carried forward. Based on the amendments to the above, effective from\nJanuary 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended to December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend\nthe tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10% of the total qualifying research and development\nexpenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for each year.\n21\nOn July 12, 2016, the ROC Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of anti-avoidance to establish Article 43-3\nControlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules and Article 43-4 Place of Effective Management (“PEM”) rules of the\nIncome Tax Act (“ITA”). Detailed introduction of the CFC and PEM rules are described as follows:\n(i) A profit-seeking enterprise (“PSE”) that directly or indirectly owns affiliated enterprises in low-tax\njurisdictions outside the territory of the ROC shall recognize and include its pro rata share of affiliated\nenterprises’ annual profits as investment income in its income tax return for the year. Subsequent actual\ndividends and distributions from such affiliated enterprises that were previously recognized as investment\nincome will then not be subject to income taxation; any surplus to previously recognized investment\nincome shall be included as taxable income in the allocated year. Low-tax jurisdictions are defined as\ncountries where the PSE income tax rate is lower than 70% of the income tax rate of the PSE in the ROC (the\nstatutory income tax rate is 20% from January 1, 2018) (Article 43-3 CFC rules); and\n(ii) A PSE is incorporated based on foreign legislation but its place of effective management (PEM) is\nmaintained within the territory of the ROC, and the head office of such PSE will be determined to be within\nthe territory of the ROC and profit-seeking enterprise income tax shall be levied in accordance with the ITA\nand relevant tax regulations. The aforementioned PEM refers to a place where substantive key management\nand commercial decisions of an entity’s business and its operations are made (Article 43-4 PEM rule).\nAccording to the legislative intent, the CFC and PEM rules, in principle, will not be put into force immediately,\nbut will wait until the China-Taiwan Cross-Strait Tax Agreement is effectuated, the OECD’s Common Reporting\nand Due Diligence Standard (“CRS”) for the automatic exchange of information of financial accounts is widely\nimplemented internationally, and the relevant bylaws of the CFC and PEM rules have been adequately enacted and\nproperly advocated. The date of implementation will be determined by the Executive Yuan. On January 14, 2022,\nExecutive Yuan had announced the relevant bylaws of the CFC would be implemented from January 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.\nHowever, if the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be\ndetermined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income\nTax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax\nin the ROC.\nWe may be affected by the Cayman Economic Substance Law\nPursuant to the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision) (as amended) of the\nCayman Islands (the “ES Act”), a “relevant entity” is required to satisfy the economic substance test set out in the\nES Act. A “relevant entity” includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands as is our company.\nBased on the current interpretation of the ES Act, we believe that our company, Himax Technologies, Inc., is a pure\nequity holding company since it only holds equity participation in other entities and only earns dividends and capital\ngains.\nAccordingly, for so long as our company is a “pure equity holding company”, it is only subject to the minimum\nsubstance requirements, which require us to (i) comply with all applicable filing requirements under the Companies\nAct (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands; and (ii) have adequate human resources and adequate premises in the\nCayman Islands for holding and managing equity participations in other entities. However, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not be subject to more requirements under the ES Act. Uncertainties over the interpretation and\nimplementation of the ES Act may have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our ADSs and Our Trading Market\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile.\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile and has ranged from a low of $7.01 to a high of $17.88 on the\nNASDAQ Global Select Market in 2021.\nThe market price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: (1)\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (2) changes in financial estimates by securities\nresearch analysts; (3) changes in the expectation of our product launch timing, forecast and estimates; (4) conditions\nin the TFT-LCD panel market; (5) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other display\n22\nsemiconductor companies; (6) announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic\npartnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (7) the addition or departure of key personnel; (8) fluctuations\nin exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar; (9) litigation related to our intellectual property; and (10)\nthe release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or sales of additional ADSs.\nIn addition, as a result of the worldwide financial crisis and recent global developments relating to Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine, global stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility\nhas had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons which may not\nbe directly related to their operating performance, including but not limited to events such as tax-loss selling, mutual\nfund redemptions, hedge fund redemptions and margin calls. These market fluctuations may also materially and\nadversely affect the market price of our ADSs.\nFuture sales or perceived sales of securities by us, our executive officers, directors or major shareholders may\nhurt the price of our ADSs.\nThe market price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales of ADSs or shares or the perception that these\nsales could occur. As of February 28, 2022, we had 348,597,140 outstanding shares and a significant number of our\nshares were beneficially owned by certain major shareholders such as our directors and executive officers. See “Item\n7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” If we, our executive officers, or\ndirectors or our shareholders sell ADSs or shares, the market price for our shares or ADSs could decline.\nYou may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting\nmaterials sufficiently in advance to be able to exercise your right to vote.\nExcept as described in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights\nattaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the\ndepositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by\nthe ADSs. In certain circumstances, the depositary shall refrain from voting and any voting instructions received\nfrom ADS holders shall lapse. Furthermore, in certain other circumstances, the depositary will give us a discretionary\nproxy to vote shares evidenced by ADSs. You may not receive voting materials sufficiently in advance to instruct the\ndepositary to vote or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties will not have the\nopportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under\nthe deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights\nand the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act, or\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation\nto file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a\nregistration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions\nfrom registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our\nrights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.\nYou may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.\nYour ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary\nmay close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenever it deems expedient in connection with\nthe performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of\nADSs generally when books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary\ndeem it necessary or advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, any government, governmental body,\ncommission, or any securities exchange on which our ADSs or ordinary shares are listed, or under any provision of\nthe deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the deposited securities or any meeting of our shareholders, or\nfor any other reason.\n23\nYour ability to protect your rights through the United States federal courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct a substantial portion of our operations in Taiwan, and all of\nour directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. However, a substantial portion of our operations is conducted in\nTaiwan through Himax Taiwan, our wholly owned subsidiary, and substantially all of our assets are located in\nTaiwan. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of\nthose persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an\naction against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have\nbeen infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind,\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to enforce a United States judgment against\nour assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of\njudgments obtained in the United States, although a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of\nthe United States under which a sum of money is payable, other than a sum payable in respect of multiple damages,\ntaxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, may be subject to enforcement\nproceedings as debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation, provided that\n(a) such federal or state courts of the United States had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment;\n(b) such federal or state courts of the United States did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman\nIslands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to\nthe public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to\nthe rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct\nprocedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\nTherefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against\nour management, directors or major shareholders than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in\nthe United States.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder because judicial precedents regarding\nshareholders’ rights are more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, and because Cayman\nIslands law generally provides less protection to shareholders than U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law, Cap. 22\n(Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman Islands Companies Law, and the\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against directors, actions by minority\nshareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent\ngoverned by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law is derived in part from comparatively\nlimited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but\nnot binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities\nof directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of\nsecurities law than the United States.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n4.A. History and Development of the Company\nHimax Taiwan, our predecessor, was incorporated on June 12, 2001 as a limited liability company under the laws\nof the ROC. On April 26, 2005, we established Himax Technologies Limited, an exempted company with limited\nliability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as a holding company to hold the shares of Himax Taiwan in\nconnection with our reorganization and share exchange. On October 14, 2005, Himax Taiwan became our wholly\nowned subsidiary through a share exchange consummated pursuant to the ROC Business Mergers and Acquisitions\nLaw through which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Himax Taiwan, and we issued ordinary\nshares to the shareholders of Himax Taiwan. Shareholders of Himax Taiwan received one of our ordinary shares in\nexchange for one Himax Taiwan common share. The share exchange was unanimously approved by shareholders\nof Himax Taiwan on June 10, 2005 with no dissenting shareholders and by the ROC Investment Commission on\nAugust 30, 2005 for our inbound investment in Taiwan, and on September 7, 2005 for our outbound investment\noutside of Taiwan. We effected this reorganization and share exchange to comply with ROC laws, which prohibit a\nTaiwan incorporated company not otherwise publicly listed in Taiwan from listing its shares on an overseas stock\nexchange. Our reorganization enables us to maintain our operations through our Taiwan subsidiary, Himax Taiwan,\n24\nwhile allowing us to list our shares overseas through our holding company structure.\nOn September 26, 2005, we changed our name to “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” and on October 17, 2005, Himax\nTaiwan changed its name to “Himax Technologies Limited” upon the approval of shareholders of both companies\nand amendments to the respective constitutive documents. We effected the name exchange in order to maintain\ncontinuity of operations and marketing under the trade name “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” which had been previously\nused by Himax Taiwan.\nOur ADSs have been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since March 31, 2006. Our ordinary shares\nare not listed or publicly traded on any trading markets.\nIn February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wisepal, currently known as Himax Semiconductor,\nInc., a fabless semiconductor company focusing on the development of LTPS TFT-LCD drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications. This transaction strengthened our competitive position in the small and medium-sized\nproduct areas and further diversified our technology and product offerings. For management purpose, Himax\nSemiconductor Inc. was merged into Himax Taiwan on July 2, 2018.\nIn March 2007, we established Himax Imaging, Inc., or Himax Imaging, which develops and markets CMOS\nimage sensors with an initial focus on camera applications used in cell phones and notebook computers.\nIn July 2012, our subsidiary, Himax Display, completed the acquisition of Spatial Photonics, currently known\nas Himax Display (USA) Inc., a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and production of\nMEMS products.\nIn June 2018, we completed the acquisition of Emza Visual Sense Ltd., or Emza, which is dedicated to the\ndevelopment of visual sensors that include proprietary machine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that\nenable always-on visual sensing capabilities, achieving improvement in power consumption, price and form factor.\nFrom time to time, we have also made minority investments in various companies for strategic purposes in the\nordinary course of business.\nOur principal executive offices are located at No. 26, Zih Lian Road, Sinshih District, Tainan City 74148,\nTaiwan, Republic of China.

Business Overview\nWe are a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. We are a\nworldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones,\ntablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics\ndevices. Additionally, we design and provide controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver\nIntegration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs and LCoS micro-displays for\naugmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. We also offer CMOS image sensors,\nwafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and ultralow power AI image sensing, which are used in a wide\nvariety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices,\nhome appliance, AIoT, etc. For display drivers and display-related products, our customers are panel manufacturers,\nagents or distributors, module manufacturers, assembly houses or end customers. We also work with camera module\nmanufacturers, optical engine manufacturers, and television system manufacturers for various non-driver products.\nIndustry Background\n25\nWe mainly operate in the flat panel display semiconductor industry. As the majority of our revenues derive from\nproducts that are critical components of flat panel displays, such as display drivers, timing controllers, power ICs and\nother semiconductor products, our industry is closely linked to the trends and developments of the flat panel display\nindustry.\nFlat Panel Display Semiconductors\nFlat panel displays require different semiconductors depending upon the display technologies and the\napplications. Some of the most important ones include the following:\n• Display Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers precise\nanalog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The major application of display driver IC is\nused on TFT-LCDs. Other than display drivers for TFT-LCDs, we also offer display drivers for AMOLED\nand Electronic Paper (e-paper) Displays. AMOLED display is getting more and more popular in recent\nyears, starting from high-end smartphone and TV applications, while e-paper display mimics traditional\npaper sheet and holds static text and images indefinitely without electricity. Detailed display driver IC\nspecification for LCD, AMOLED and e-paper are different due to panel characteristics. The two main types\nof display drivers for a display panel are gate drivers and source drivers. Gate drivers turn on the transistor\nwithin each pixel cell on the horizontal line on the panel for data input at each row. Source drivers receive\nimage data from the timing controller and generate voltage that is applied to the liquid crystal within each\npixel cell on the vertical line on the panel for data input at each column. The combination determines the\ncolors generated by each pixel. Typically, multiple gate drivers and source drivers are installed separately\non the panel. However, for certain small and medium-sized applications, gate drivers and source drivers are\nintegrated into a single chip due to space and cost considerations. Large-sized panels typically have higher\nresolution and require more display drivers than small and medium-sized panels.\n• Timing Controller. The timing controller receives image data and converts the format for the source drivers’\ninput. The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate and source drivers. Typically, the\ntiming controller is a discrete semiconductor in large-sized TFT-LCD and AMOLED panels. For certain\nsmall and medium-sized applications, however, the timing controller may be integrated with display drivers.\n• Operational Amplifier. An operational amplifier supplies the reference voltage to source drivers in order to\nmake their output voltage uniform.\n• Power IC. Power ICs include certain drivers, amplifiers, DC to DC converters and other semiconductors\ndesigned to enhance power management, such as voltage regulation, voltage boosting and battery\nmanagement.\n• Touch controller IC. For touch screen applications, touch controller ICs enable touch interfaces, such as\ncapacitive touch panels, to identify, qualify and track user’s contacts with precision and sensibility.\n• Others. Flat panel displays also require multiple general purposes semiconductors such as memory, power\nconverters and inverters.\nCharacteristics of the Display Driver Market\nAlthough we operate in several distinct segments of the flat panel display semiconductor industry, our principal\nproducts are display drivers. Display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays. The display driver market\nhas specific characteristics, including those discussed below.\nConcentration of Panel Manufacturers\nThe global TFT-LCD panel industry consists of a small number of manufacturers, substantially all of which\nare based in Asia. In recent years, Korean TFT-LCD panel makers have gradually undergone restructurings to shift\ntheir technology and manufacture focus from TFT-LCD to OLED and TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, especially\nChina-based manufacturers which have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct and ramp up\nadditional fab capacity. The capital-intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel manufacturers\noperating at a high level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to create a temporary\noversupply of panels, which reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing pressure on component\n26\ncompanies including display driver companies. Moreover, the concentration of panel manufacturers permits major\npanel manufacturers to exert pricing pressure on display driver companies such as us. The small number of panel\nmanufacturers exacerbates this situation as display driver companies, in addition to seeking to expand their customer\nbase, must also focus on winning a larger percentage of such customers’ display driver requirements.\nCustomization Requirements\nEach panel display has a unique pixel design to meet its particular requirements. To optimize the panel’s\nperformance, display drivers have to be customized for each panel design. The most common customization\nrequirement is for the display driver company to optimize the gamma curve of each display driver for each panel\ndesign. Display driver companies must work closely with their customers to develop semiconductors that meet their\ncustomers’ specific needs in order to optimize the performance of their products.\nMixed-Signal Design and High-Voltage CMOS Process Technology\nDisplay drivers have specific design and manufacturing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor\nindustry. Some display drivers require mixed-signal design since they combine both analog and digital devices\non a single semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data. Manufacturing display drivers require\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5 to 24 volts for source drivers and 10 to 50 volts\nfor gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in the semiconductor industry. For display drivers, the\ndriving voltage must be maintained under a very high degree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve using\nstandard CMOS process technology. Moreover, manufacturing display drivers does not require very small-geometry\nsemiconductor processes. Typically, the manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require geometries\nbetween 0.11 micron and 1 micron because the physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not allow for\nthe economical reduction in geometries below this range. We believe that there are a limited number of fabs with\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing of display drivers.\nSpecial Assembly and Testing Requirements\nManufacturing display drivers requires certain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that are not\nstandard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited number of providers. The assembly of display\ndrivers typically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass, also known as COG,\ntechnologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold bumps are plated onto\neach wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and the glass, in the case of COG\npackages. TAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip on film, also known as COF. The type\nof assembly used depends on the panel manufacturer’s design, which is influenced by panel size and application and\nis typically determined by the panel manufacturers. Display drivers for large-sized applications typically require\nTAB package and, to a lesser extent, COG package types, whereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and\nconsumer electronics products typically require COG packages. The testing of display drivers also requires special\ntesters that can support high-channel and high-voltage output semiconductors. Such testers are not standard in the\nsemiconductor industry.\nSupply Chain Management\nThe manufacturing of display drivers is complex and requires several manufacturing stages such as wafer\nfabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing, and the availability of materials such as the processed tape\nused in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and material requirements collectively as the “supply\nchain”. Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of capacity utilization and require a reliable supply\nof display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this supply, may disrupt panel manufacturers’\noperations. As a result, a company’s ability to deliver its products on a timely basis at the quality and quantity\nrequired is critical to satisfying its existing customers and winning new ones. Such supply chain management is\nparticularly crucial to fabless display driver companies that do not have their own in-house manufacturing capacity.\nIn the case of display drivers, supply chain management is further complicated by the high-voltage CMOS process\ntechnology and the special assembly and testing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor industry.\nAccess to this capacity also depends in part on display driver companies having received assurances of demand\nfor their products since semiconductor manufacturing service providers require credible demand forecasts before\nallocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity to support growth.\n27\nNeed for Higher Level of Integration\nThe small form factor of smartphone, tablet, automotive and certain consumer electronics products restricts the\nspace for components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically require one or more source drivers, one\nor more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors or as an integrated\nsingle-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order to manufacture more\ncompact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display driver companies must be\nable to offer highly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver and timing controller, as well as\nsemiconductors such as memory, power circuit and image processors, into a single chip. Due to the size restrictions\nand stringent power consumption constraints of such display drivers, single-chip drivers are complex to design.\nFor large-sized panel applications, integration is both more difficult to achieve and less important since size and\nweight are less of a priority. Lastly, as some of our TFT-LCD panel customers had turned to pure in-cell TDDI panel\ndevelopment for thinner display designs, we have developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated\ncircuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.\nProducts and Solutions\nWe have several principal product lines:\n• display drivers and timing controllers;\n• touch controller ICs;\n• ASIC service;\n• LCoS and MEMS products;\n• power ICs;\n• CMOS image sensor products;\n• wafer level optics products;\n• 3D sensing business; and\n• Ultralow power AI image sensing.\nDisplay Drivers and Timing Controllers\nDisplay Driver Characteristics\nDisplay drivers deliver precise analog voltages and currents that activate the pixels on panels. The following is a\nsummary of certain display driver characteristics and their relationship to panel performance.\n• Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied by\nthe number of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed on a panel. For\nexample, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red columns, 1,024 green columns\nand 1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and 768 rows. The red, green and blue columns are\ncommonly referred to as “RGB.” Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072 column outputs and\n768 row outputs. The number of display drivers required for each panel depends on the resolution of the\npanel and the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) panel\nrequires eight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three 256-channel gate drivers (768\n= 256 x 3), while a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel requires eight 720-channel source drivers and\nfour 270-channel gate drivers. The number of display drivers required can be reduced by using drivers\nwith a higher number of channels. For example, a full HD panel can have six 960-channel source drivers\ninstead of eight 720-channel source drivers. Thus, using display drivers with a higher number of channels\ncan reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel, although display drivers with a higher\nnumber of channels typically have higher unit costs.\n28\n• Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a screen, which is determined\nby the number of shades of a color, also known as gray scale, that can be shown by the panel. For example,\na 6-bit source driver is capable of generating 26 x 26 x 26 = 218, or 262K colors, and similarly, an 8-bit\nsource driver is capable of generating 16 million colors. Typically, for TFT-LCD panels currently in\ncommercial production, 262K, 16 million and 1 billion colors are supported by 6-bit, 8-bit and 10-bit source\ndrivers, respectively.\n• Operational Voltage. A display driver operates with two voltages: the input voltage (which enables it to\nreceive signals from the timing controller) and the output voltage (which, in the case of source drivers,\nis applied to liquid crystals and, in the case of gate drivers, is used to switch on the TFT device). Source\ndrivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from 4.5 to 24\nvolts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from\n10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers electromagnetic interference, or EMI. Output\nvoltage may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the liquid crystal (or diode), in the case\nof source drivers, or TFT device, in the case of gate drivers.\n• Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to it\nby the source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve” of the source driver. Different\npanel design and manufacturing processes require source drivers with different gamma curves. Display\ndrivers need to adjust the gamma curve to fit the pixel design. Due to the materials and processes used in\nmanufacturing, panels may contain certain imperfections which can be corrected by the gamma curve of\nthe source driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma correction.” For certain types of liquid\ncrystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly different and thus need to be independently\ncorrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three independent gamma curves for RGB cells.\n• Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display\ndrivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger\ndata volume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data transmission applications, such as\ntelevisions, require more advanced interface technology. The principal types of interface technologies are\ntransistor-to-transistor logic, or TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS, mini-low voltage\ndifferential signaling, or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high-speed interface. Among these, RSDS, mini-\nLVDS and point-to-point interface were developed as low power, low noise and low amplitude methods\nfor high-speed data transmission using fewer copper wires and resulting in lower EMI. Moreover, there\nare some panel manufacturers developing their proprietary point-to-point interfaces, such as embedded\npanel interface, or EPI, USI-T, iSP, CEDS, CHPI, CSPI and CMPI.\n• Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses TAB and COG package types. COF and\nTCP are two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly used in recent\nyears. Customers typically determine the package type required according to their specific mechanical and\nelectrical considerations. In general, display drivers for small-sized panels mainly use COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for large-sized panels primarily use TAB package types and, to a lesser extent,\nCOG package types.\nLarge-Sized Applications\nWe provide source drivers, gate drivers, PMIC, P-gamma OP level shifter and timing controllers (TCON) for\nlarge-sized panels principally used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and televisions. Display drivers used\nin large-sized applications feature different key characteristics, depending on the end-use application. For example,\nthe industry trend for large-sized applications is generally toward super high channel, low power consumption, low\ncost, thin and light form factor, touch function, higher data transmission rate and higher driving capabilities. Higher\nspeed interface technologies are also key for 4Kx2K and 8Kx4K high-resolution TVs. Greater color depth, thermal\nsolution, high data rate and high driving, are particularly important for advanced televisions and certain monitors.\nOur large display driver IC business achieved several milestones from 2019. For example, we successfully added\n12-inch fabs into the pool of our foundry capacity for our large display driver ICs to ease the capacity shortage of\n8” foundry where the vast majority of large panel driver ICs are fabricated. On high-end TV, Himax outpaced peers\nto lead the mass production of customized high-speed point-to-point (P2P) transmission using embedded panel intra\ninterface such as iSP, CHPI, USI-T, CMPI, CEDS and CSPI for 4K TVs and developed a 2-in-1 COF driver to meet\nthe requirements of high channel count and heat dissipation for 8K TV. On gaming monitor, we have high frame rate\n29\nand high driving driver to meet various resolutions needs and frame rates such as UHD 165Hz, QHD 240Hz, FHD\n360Hz, etc. We also successfully developed low power consumption driver applied in low power monitor to satisfied\nEnergy Star 8.0 and even Energy Star 9.0. Lastly, our P2P driver and TCON ICs with 13.3\" FHD can meet Intel 1W\nproject requirement.\nWe also made tremendous progress in TCON product lines in 2021. UHD TV penetration rate is larger than 60%\nsince 2021, and we developed competitive UHD TV TCON to seize this market. Himax UHD TV TCON has mass\nproduction at all major China LCD makers and the revenues has double growth in 2021. We also provide gaming\nTCON for the new QHD 240Hz and UHD 144Hz gaming monitor and notebook. For high-end gaming requirement,\nwe have developed eDP 8.1G TCON to increase bandwidth. We also have embedded local dimming in TCON\nICs for TFT-LCD automotive applications to support higher contrast instrument panels needed for drivers to read\nthe content of the meter quickly. Additionally, several key panel makers also seek Himax cooperation to develop\nAMOLED for automotive applications. We have developed certain customized AMOLED ASIC for these key panel\nmakers and some of them started entering mass production in 2021.\nThe table below sets forth the features of our products for large-sized applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers • 384 to 1920 output channels\n• 6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16 million colors) or 10-bit (1 billion\ncolors)\n• one gamma-type driver\n• two gamma-type drivers to improve display quality\n• three gamma-type drivers (RGB independent gamma curve to\nenhance color image)\n• output driving voltage ranging from 7 up to 20V\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\nand support half VDDA\n• low power consumption and low EMI\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS (up to 400MHz), cascade\nmodulated driver interface, or CMDI, point-to-point high speed\ninterface (up to 4Gbps for 8K 120Hz) and customized interface\ntechnologies\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers • 192 to 1600 output channels\n• output driving voltage ranging from 10 up to 50v\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n• low power consumption\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\nTiming Controllers • product portfolio supports a wide range of resolutions, from VGA\n(640 x 480 pixels) to full HD, UHD and 8K4K (1,920 x 1,080 pixels,\n1,920 x 1,200 pixels, 3840 x 2160 and 7680 x 4320)\n• support mini-LVDS, point-to-point high speed interface and\ncustomized output interface technologies\n• embedded overdrive function to improve response time\n• support CABC and local dimming to save power and color engine to\nenhance color and sharpness\n• support TTL, LVDS, eDP, G-sync, MIPI and V-by-one input\ninterface technologies\n• support dual-gate, triple-gate, GOA (gate on array) and RGBW panel\ndesigns\n30\nProduct Features\n• support amorphous silicon, IGZO and LTPS panel\n• ASIC AMOLED timing controller\nProgrammable Gamma OP • 8 to 16 channel gamma buffer outputs\n• channel VCOM buffer output\n• Internal non-volatile memory\n• 2 gamma bank selection, setting time < 3uS\n• Analog power supply voltage: 9.0V to 20.0V\n• Digital power supply voltage: 2.7V to 3.6V\n• Peak current on gamma channels: 200mA\n• Peak current on VCOM channel: 400mA\n• Programmable VCOM limit\n• 12C speed up to 1MHz\nTablet Display Drivers • highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, power\ncircuit, and timing controller\n• suitable for a wide range of resolutions from WSVGA (600 x 1024),\nWXGA (800 x 1280), WUXGA (1200x1920) to WQXGA (1600 x 2560)\n• support up to 16 million colors\n• support RGB separated gamma adjustment\n• support CABC\n• support color enhancement features\n• support MIPI interface\n• touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch\ndisplay\n• supporting TDDI with active stylus\n• COG and COF solutions for super slim bezel\nSmall and Medium -Sized Applications\nAutomotive Display Applications\nWe offer source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers and integrated drivers for the fast ramping automotive\ndisplay applications, such as instrument cluster display (ICD), center stack display (CSD), head-up display (HUD),\nrear seat entertainment display (RSE), rearview mirror display and sideview mirror display.\nThe automotive display drivers can support various display resolutions to meet the customized needs of\nautomotive display, including GIP panel and non-GIP panel, a-Si TFT panel and LTPS panel.

This has also contributed to increased demand for larger size and higher\nresolution smartphone displays. In the past few years, we offered innovative handset display driver products by\nproviding FWVGA (480 x 864), qHD (540 x 960), WSVGA (1024 x 600), HD720 (720 x 1280)/ WXGA (800\nx 1280), FHD (1080 x 1920) / WUXGA (1200 x 1920) and up to QHD (1440 x 2560) / WQXGA (1600x2560)\ndisplay driver ICs. We continue to update new products for this mainstream smartphone and tablet markets with\nlower cost and new features, such as color enhancement and sun-light readability enhancement functions. In 2015,\nwe developed new technologies and led the display industry with next generation display driver ICs, such as a-si\nFHD (1080 x 1920), AMOLED ASICs for HD and FHD and LTPS QHD (1440 x 2560) with sub-pixel rendering\ntechnologies. In 2016, Himax developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for\nadvanced in-cell touch display panel. Himax started the shipments of in-cell TDDI for some smartphones in 2016\nand extended TDDI solution to tablet application in 2017. Smartphone display had a dramatic change in terms of\naspect ratio, instead of resolution, in 2017. Though display resolution of entry smartphones kept moving up from\nWVGA or qHD to HD, high-end smartphone display may be stuck at FHD or QHD since it’s pixel per inch is good\nenough for normal consumers’ daily use. OEMs start to seek for differentiation with 18:9 or even wider aspect ratio,\nfull front displays. Himax has designed conventional 16:9 HD and FHD DDICs capable of supporting 18:9 or wider\nHD+/FHD+ displays and achieved a number of design-wins with leading Chinese smartphone brands. As in-cell\nTDDI, featuring thinner display, slimmer border, and better visual quality, has been getting popular, we re-invented\na new generation of TDDIs supporting COG and COF for 18:9 or wider aspect ratio with interlaced output pins,\nwhich makes the bottom border of the in-cell touch display even smaller to gain higher display to body ratio. Our\nFHD+ and HD+ TDDI successfully gained design-wins with a few leading Korean and Chinese smartphone brands\nand panel makers. We started small volume shipment in the first half of 2018 with accelerating volume started in the\nsecond half of 2018 into 2019 and beyond. In 2020 and 2021, Himax extended our product offerings with high frame\nrate TDDI solution and has started shipping to top-tier smartphone OEMs.\nA major development we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the OLED display for\nsmartphone, smart watch, automotive and tablet. This is due to investments on expanded AMOLED capacity as well\nas increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED display for the\ntime being. We are collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China for AMOLED product development\nin smartphone, tablet, automotive and other consumer electronics. We believe AMOLED driver ICs will soon\nbecome one of the major growth engines for our small and medium-sized panel driver IC business.\nOn the other hand, the application of in-cell TDDI started to extend from mainstream smartphone to larger\ndisplays in 2018. Himax started to offer various new TDDI solutions for tablet, smart speakers, and even some\ninfotainment displays in automobiles. The first tablet TDDI with WXGA resolution went mass production in 2018\nand also extended to leading smart speaker applications as well. In 2019, Himax announced a series of new driver\nand TDDIs for tablet application. The COF packaged driver IC solution enables one leading tablet OEM successfully\nlaunching WQXGA resolution tablet with super slim bezel. We also added another new features to our TDDI that can\nsupport up to WUXGA and WQXGA resolution has gained several design-win from tablet OEMs across Korea and\nChina in 2019. We also launched the first TDDI supporting active stylus function in tablets which commenced mass\nproduction and contribute to our tablet application business in early 2020. With the demand increase for bigger size\ndisplay, higher resolution, and precise touch accuracy and stylus performance, Himax kept developing new tablet\nTDDIs to broaden company’s product lineup to maintain our leading market position. We started mass production\nfor the world’s first 12.4” WQXGA super high-resolution in-cell tablet PC with a leading end customer in 2021.\nTablet in-cell TDDI offers the benefits of lower cost and a simplified supply chain that represents an easier\nmanufacturing process for panel makers. For consumers, it offers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish design\nas well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus. Our active stylus in-cell technology is\nadopted in many launched tablet products. At present, we are the dominant supplier for literally all leading Android\nnames. In 2020, tablet demand is picking up significantly fueled mainly by remote work and online learning demand\ndue to the pandemic.

All level shifter\nchannels feature the same input circuitry and are compatible with the standard logic-level signals generated by\ntiming controllers in typical applications. The level shifter converts the timing-controller (TCON) logic-level\nsignals to the high-level signals needed by the GOA (gate on array) display. The output circuitry has been designed\nto achieve high rise and fall times when driving the capacitive loads typically encountered in TFT-LCD display\napplications.\nProduct Features\n16- channel output level shifter for • Support 1 or 2 of T-con input signals\nGOA TFT-LCD • Support 1 or 2 input and 4/6/8/10 clock channel output\n• 2 channel STV\n• 2 channel LC\n• Reset function\n• OTP/ SCP and OCP function by I2C or Resistor adjustment\nLED driver\nA light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that is widely used in lighting, display and TFT\nLCD backlight nowadays. The advantages of LEDs as light sources are the small size, fast switching, low power\nconsumption and long lifetime etc.\nLED driver IC is designed to dim the LEDs with critical features such as high current accuracy, high current\nmatching, short LED protection, open LED protection, over voltage protection, ghosting effect reduction and\ncurrent sink leakage protection etc.\nProduct Features\nCustomer ASIC • By Customer Specification\nCMOS Image Sensor Products\nThe CMOS image sensor products are developed by our subsidiary, Himax Imaging. The products were\ndesigned firstly for camera-equipped mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and notebook computers, with\na focus on low light image and video quality. Although it seems relatively challenging for us to gain significant\nmarket share in conventional RGB camera, we do think there are various interesting and different applications in\nimaging. Based on the technologies and IP we developed, on top of legacy products for laptop and multimedia\nwe have been supplying, our product lines have been expanded to cover three domains: ultralow power computer\nvision- Always-On Sensor (“AoS”), Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, and big pixel BSI sensors in automotive and\nsurveillance. In 2019, we further prioritized our focus on ultralow power computer vision- Always-On Sensor\n(“AoS”) as the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. Together\nwith the technologies we already developed, such as Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, we can provide our customers\nthe best integrated solutions for several specific domains.\nIn addition to advancing our AoS sensor to drive the power as low as possible, we also devote ourselves to\ndeveloping sensors that have industry leading small pixel (1.12um) with higher near infrared Quantum Efficiency\n(“QE”) to support the new generation cameras. Their superior performance hugely helps to reduce the system’s\npower consumption and therefore enhances the system performance. With the high QE in NIR band, we open the\ndoors to building more sensor and camera systems for machine vision. For example, our HM11B1 is a critical\npart of Himax’s WiseEye notebook solution, an AI-based ultralow power AI image sensing total solution and\nhas penetrated into the laptop ecosystem for the most stylish super slim bezel design. Given its slim dimension\n(narrower than 2mm of the chip itself) to support ultra-thin bezel, we originally combine IR sensor to support\nWindows Hello, and then added intelligent AoS sensor into a single silicon. This 2-in-1 sensor not only enables\nnew features, but also greatly saves laptop makers’ effort in mechanical design and overall cost.\n38\nWe are committed to be a key player in the CMOS image sensor business with continuous investment in\nexperienced human resources, an efficient supply chain as well as strategic technology developments and\npartnerships to further increase the performance and

semiconductor process on wafers. This innovative\napproach enables wafer level optics to manufacture micro/nano optics structure and high temperature resistance,\nmaking the compatible Surface-Mount Technology or SMT reflow process possible. We offer entire optical solutions\nfor customers who need compact and easy-to-handle optical products on their electronic devices.\nCombining traditional optical lens design, precise mold control and semiconductor manufacturing expertise,\nour WLO lens with integrated waveguide, refractive optics and diffractive optical element (DOE) is one of the best\n40\nsolution for next generation computational imaging module for 2D/3D illumination and 3D dot projector, which\ncan be applied to 3D face recognition, 3D sensing, 3D reconstruction, and gesture control. Himax is a pioneer in\nhigh-precision diffraction optics technology with 15 years of experience, having worked on very different designs\nover a variety of applications with some of the world’s most heavyweight tech names. With the innovative process\nand specific structure, our wafer level optics products provide small form factor and compact module size to be\neasily integrated into consumer products. The diffraction optics technology is now well adopted in 3D sensing,\nAR/VR devices, holographic display, biomedical inspection, optical communication, etc. We are seeing that DOE\nplays an even more decisive role for the next generation optical technology in light of its high-precision and\nlightweight characteristics.\nOur WLO technology is also adapted to form microstructure such as lens array, DOE and lenticular lens for\nadvanced applications in digital and computational imaging fields. These technologies stand in a unique position\nto integral optical design, semiconductor manufacturing process, and compact packaging service, which are\nrarely covered by one single company. Deeply rooted in core wafer level optics technologies, we provide highly\ncustomized optical solutions and high-volume manufacturing to many tier-one customers such as structured lighted\nand ToF 3D sensing on mobile device, AR/VR gadgets, biomedical devices and other applications.\nOur WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer.\nThe overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in\nmore models. In 2019, we continued the strong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill anchor customer’s higher\ndemand with a significant year-over-year increase. In 2021, we continued our shipment to an anchor customer for\ntheir legacy product. We continue to make progress with ongoing R&D projects with world-leading high tech giants\nfor ToF 3D sensing, AR/VR gadgets, biomedical devices and others, targeting their future generation products\ncentered around our exceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our wafer level optics products:\nProduct Features\nRefractive Optical Lens • for Micro Lens Array (MLA) illumination diffuser, lighting control,\nflux illumination lens, collimation lens, and compact size camera lens\n• provide multi-layer solution including optical AR coating,\nIR-cutting filter coating, aspheric surface\n• double-side manufacture process\n• already in mass production\nDiffractive Optical Element (DOE) • computational imaging, flux illumination, dot projector for 3D\nsensing, 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE and refractive lens\n• provide customized solution for specific application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nDiffuser element for flood • using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE technology\nillumination and TOF • the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nNear Infrared (NIR) Projector • dot projector module solution for computer vision, 3D sensing, 3D\nModule reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• integral NIR Laser (830/850/940nm), optical system (refractive+\ndiffractive lens) and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution to provide the smallest form factor\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• provide customized module solution for different application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\nFlood illumination Module • provide customized solution for specific application integral NIR\n41\nProduct Features\nLaser (830/850/940nm), and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n3D Sensing Business\nWe continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing projects.\nIn 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing total solution targeting Android smartphone’s front-facing application\nwas unsuccessful due to the high hardware cost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time required to integrate\nit into the smartphone and the lack of killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and online payment.\nInstead of 3D sensing, most of the Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost fingerprint technology which\ncan achieve similar phone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised user experience.\nBeing a leading provider of 3D sensing technology, Himax is also an active participant in smartphone OEMs’\ndesign projects for new devices involving ToF technology. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone\nmakers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D depth\ninformation generation for AR. Unlike structured light 3D sensing where we provide total solution or just projector\nmodule or optics depending on customers’ needs, with ToF, we will only focus on transmitter module or optics\ncomponent by leveraging our WLO related expertise. We continue to actively work with industry leading VCSEL\nprovider, sensor company, module manufactures and smartphone makers for a new and advanced ToF 3D solution\ndevelopment, targeting Android smartphones. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we have provided our partners\nwith spot projector or optics component for their reference design.\n3D sensing can have a wide range of applications beyond smartphone. We have started to explore business\nopportunities in various industries by leveraging our structured light 3D sensing total solution. In 2021, we shipped\nsmall volume of business access control and biomedical inspection devices with more design-ins and engagements\ncurrently under progress. To strengthen our offers in 3D sensing total solution, we have been collaborating closely\nmainly with two types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial recognition algorithm and those\noffering application processors with strong AI capability.\nOther than 3D sensing total solution, we provide key component, our proprietary 3D decoder IC, to\ncustomers who wish to design their own structured light-based 3D sensing solution. It was already certified by\nthe leading Chinese electronic payment standard with requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation\nand strict privacy and now it’s well-adopted by many China e-payment solution providers and entered into\nsmall volume production from 2020. Our 3D decoder can accelerate local image processing for face recognition\nand offer best-in-class security authentication. In 2021, we have shipped meaningful volume of 3D decoder ICs.\nOur critical 3D sensing Technologies includes the following:\nWafer Level Optics Products\nWLO is one of the key technologies enabling 3D sensing, AR goggle devices, and many other applications.\nLevering on our exceptional design know-how and mass production experience in WLO technology, we are able to\nproduce the world’s most compact optics required for 3D sensing, meanwhile achieving superior performance and\nlower costs.\nASIC\nOne of the critical elements of our 3D sensing total solution is an ASIC for 3D depth map generation. We are able\nto develop the ASIC thanks to our unique in-house capability in developing video ASICs for customers. Equipped\nwith the ASIC, our 3D sensing total solution can substantially reduce the power consumed while processing 3D\nsensing, enhance personal data security, accelerate the 3D depth map generation, and provide superior depth data\noutput that matches with our optical component. We consider this unique capability as our competitive advantage. It\nhas been and will continue to be one of our key drivers in the success of our 3D sensing total solution.\n42\nActive Alignment\nWith much experience in optical assembly for AR and VR devices, our factory has developed a system to do\nactive alignment for tiny components. From the incoming quality check, assembly process, and testing, all steps\nare monitored and checked. The precision assembly capability gives us a very good foundation to do the optical\nassembly for DOE, WLO, and laser.\nLaser Driver\nBased on our expertise in projector, optics, and driver, we have designed a special Glass Broken Detection\n(“GBD”) mechanism on our projector. We also have a proprietary laser driver design that detect the connection of\nthe GBD on the projector. When GBD connection is abnormal, which means glass was broken, the laser driver can\ncease the laser to prevent users from being exposed to higher power laser energy leaking from the broken glass.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our SLiM 3D sensing solutions:\nProduct Features\nSLiM 3D sensing total solution • Dot projector: More than 33,000 invisible dots, the highest in the\nindustry, projected onto object to build the most sophisticated 3D\ndepth map among all structured light solutions\n• Depth map accuracy: Error rate of < 0.5% within the entire\noperation range of 30cm-100cm\n• Face recognition: Enabled by the most sophisticated 3D depth data\nto build unique facial map that can be used for instant unlock and\nsecure online payment\n• Indoor/outdoor sensitivity: Superior sensing capability even under\ntotal darkness or bright sunlight\n• Eye safety: Certified for IEC 60825 Class 1, the international laser\nproduct standard which governs laser product safety under all\nconditions of normal use with naked eyes\n• Glass broken detection: Patented glass broken detection mechanism\nin the dot projector whereby laser is shut down instantaneously in\nthe event of broken glass in the projector\n• Power consumption: Less than 400mW for projector, sensor and\ndepth decoding combined, making it the lowest power consuming\n3D sensing device by far among all structured light solutions\n• Module size: the smallest structured light solution in the market,\nideal for embedded and mobile device integration\nHV-II 3D Decoder ASIC • Himax 3D Depth Processor with high depth accuracy\n• Support up to HD resolution depth map for different applications\n• 2D & 3D auto-exposure control for projector and sensor\n• Frame rate conversion for different application/capability of SOC\n• Scaling engine for different application/capability of SOC\n• Ambient light detection and removal\n• Embedded Security Engine\n• Power Management Engine for power shutdown\n• MIPI CSI-2 / DPHY interface\nUltralow power AI image sensing\nThe demand for always-on battery-powered smart devices with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. By\ncombining an ultralow power image sensor with a custom computer vision ASIC and machine-learning algorithms,\nHimax ultralow power AI image sensing solution enriches connected edge devices with AI capacity. The edge AI\nsystem, which consumes only few mW power consumptions, is leading the industry for the next-generation, battery\noperated, clever computer vision applications. The ultralow power AI image sensing solution is being engaged in a\nvariety of applications, such as notebook, home appliances, utility meter, automotive, battery-powered surveillance\ncamera, panoramic video conferencing, and medical, just to name a few. Among Himax’s ultralow power AI image\nsensing business, our WiseEye notebook solution provides a ‘laptop-ready’ 3-in-1 RGB/IR/AI solution that features\n43\nrespecting privacy and enhancing security for notebook users.

For key component business model, we reinforced our\ngo-to-market strategy by intensively participating in leading AI partners’ infrastructures and ecosystems. With\nour prominent AI platforms, we partnered with world leading edge-to-cloud service providers, such as Google\nTensorFlow, Microsoft Azure, Arm AI Partner Program, and tinyML Foundation, and enjoy the enormous network\nof these ecosystems and their numerous participants to drive further adoption on applications such as smart home,\nsmart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation. Additionally, we continued our marketing efforts\nthrough joint webinars and other online activities with several well-known platform partners such as Edge Impulse,\nDigi-Key and SparkFun. We continue to receive inquiries from large corporations and individual developers alike\n44\nwith hundreds of evaluation boards and developments kits having been purchased online and distributed across the\nglobe. We are very encouraged by the traction this relatively new product line has generated in a short amount of\ntime and expect to see increasing sales contribution through 2022 and beyond.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our WE-I Plus ASIC product:\nProduct Features\nWE-I Plus ASIC • Ultralow power consumption: 40 uW/MHz\n• Support image, voice trigger simultaneously to wake up system\n• Optimized multi-layer power states for always-on applications\n• Ready-for- use software package and Machine Learning Library,\nincluding device driver, SDK and embARC Machine Learning\nInference Library to support Google TensorFlow Lite Micro framework\n• ARC-EM9D 32-bit DSP: Frequency up to 400MHz,\n• Memory: Up to 2MByte SRAM\n• High performance pixel processing accelerator and JPEG codec\n• Security Engine: Support secure boot, secure FW update, secure\ndebug mode, Support AES 128bits, RSA 2048bits, Hash-256,\nTRNG, Secure key management\n• Peripheral: 1/4/8-bit camera interface, I2C/SPI master/slave,\nUART, PWM, GPIO with 5 wake-up pins, 12-bit ADC with 4\nchannels, up to 1Msps, RTC Timer\nCore Technologies and Know-How\nDriving System Technology. Through our collaboration with panel manufacturers, we have developed extensive\nknowledge of circuit design, TFT-LCD driving systems, high-voltage CMOS processes and display systems, all\nof which are important to the design of high-performance TFT-LCD display drivers. Our engineers have in-depth\nknowledge of the driving system technology, which is the architecture for the interaction between the source\ndriver, gate driver, timing controller and power systems as well as other passive components. We believe that\nour understanding of the entire driving system has strengthened our design capabilities. Our engineers are highly\nskilled in designing power efficient and compact display drivers that enhance the performance of TFT-LCD. We are\nleveraging our know-how of display drivers and driving system technology to develop display drivers for panels\nutilizing other technologies such as AMOLED and electronic paper displays.\nHigh-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design. Unlike most other semiconductors, TFT-LCD display drivers require a\nhigh output voltage of 3.3 to 50 volts. We have developed circuit design technologies using a high-voltage CMOS\nprocess that enables us to produce high-yield, reliable and compact drivers for high-volume applications. Moreover,\nour technologies enable us to keep the driving voltage at very high uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve\nwhen using standard CMOS process technology.\nHigh-Bandwidth Interfaces. In addition to high-voltage circuit design, TFT-LCD display drivers require high\nbandwidth transmission for video signals. We have applied several high-speed interfaces, including transistor-transistor\nlogic (“TTL”), Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), mini low-voltage differential signaling (“LVDS”),\ndual-edge TTL (“DETTL”), turbo Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), Mobile Industry Processor\nInterface (“MIPI”) and other customized interfaces in our display drivers. Moreover, we are developing additional\ndriver interfaces for special applications with optimized speed, lower EMI and higher system stability.\nDie Shrink and Low Power Technologies. Our engineers are highly skilled in employing their knowledge\nof driving technology and high-voltage CMOS circuit design to shrink the die size of our display drivers while\nleveraging their understanding of driving technology and panel characteristics to design display drivers with low\npower consumption. Die size is an important consideration for applications with size constraints. Smaller die size\nalso reduces the cost of the chip. Lower power consumption is important for many portable devices such as notebook\ncomputers, smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products.\nAI Image Sensing Technologies. Composed by an AoS sensor, an edge AI ASIC processor and computer-vision\nAI algorithm, all operated in ultralow power mode. Our industrial first AoS CMOS image sensor features ultralow\npower and low latency back-illuminated solution for always on, intelligent visual sensing applications. With Himax\nexceptional low power know-how and ASIC implementation technologies, our AI image processor featured different\n45\npower domain and mode management schemes, together with advanced image processing hardwired accelerators\nto construct different operating modes in balancing processor performance and power consumptions. The seamless\nand proprietary interface between our AoS sensor and AI processor ensure the efficient and fast-response sensor data\ntransmission and wake-up mechanism operating in ultralow power mode. The computer-vision AI algorithm, which\nget benefit from high performance and low power AI processor and image data from sensor, can therefore enable AI\nfeatures such as powerful human detection, occupancy detection and motion classification for various application\nneeds.\nLCoS Microdisplay Technologies. Compared to other microdisplay technologies, LCoS microdisplay offers\nsmaller form factor, higher brightness, and less power consumption. Himax Display has own proficient engineering\nteam to develop patented industry-only non-captive LCoS, front-lit waveguide, and module design, along with\nan in-house ISO certified manufacture line. All position us at the forefronts of leading AR glasses and AR-HUD\nmarkets. The latest development of Front-Lit LCoS enables an ultra-compact and extremely power-efficient optical\nengine by consolidating and integrating LED illumination system into the micro display module itself and makes\nthe patented technology ideal for AR headsets. Furthermore, Himax Display provided phase modulation LCoS\n2.0 technologies to offer high-efficient, low power and multi-focal plane displaying features to fit for holographic\ndisplaying needs in numerous leading applications.\n3D Technologies. Several technologies in Himax are integrated together to form our 3D solution. First, wafer\nlevel nanoimprinted technology is used to design and manufacture DOE and Waveguide. Then, our in-house\ncapability on semiconductor enables us to design IC particularly match our optical component. Our expertise in\nprecision assembly in optics also help us to provide a more complete solution to our customers.\nCustomers\nOur customers for display drivers are primarily panel manufacturers and mobile device module manufacturers,\nwho in turn design and market their products to manufacturers of end-use products such as notebook computers,\ndesktop monitors, televisions, smartphone, tablet, automotive and consumer electronics products. We may sell our\nproducts through agents or distributors for certain products or in certain regions. As of December 31, 2021, we sold\nour products to more than 200 customers. Our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 75.6%,\n77.7% and 79.5% of our revenues in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, our two largest\ncustomers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue: customer A and its affiliates accounted for 29.5%, 32.6%\nand 32.1% of our revenues, respectively; and customer C accounted for 5.6%, 12.7% and 19.1%, respectively.\nCertain of our customers provide us with a long-term (twelve-month) forecast plus three-month rolling\nnon-binding forecasts and confirm orders about one month ahead of scheduled delivery. In general, purchase\norders are not cancellable by either party, although from time to time we and our customers have agreed to\namend the terms of such orders.\nSales and Marketing\nWe focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology relationships principally with\nTFT-LCD panel manufacturers, panel manufacturers using LTPS or OLED, or Oxide technologies, mobile display\nmodule and mobile device manufacturers for smartphone, tablet and automotive, and camera module houses in order\nto work closely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product road maps. Our engineers\ncollaborate with our customers’ engineers to create products that comply with their specifications and provide a high\nlevel of performance at competitive prices and also create customized features for end brand customers. Our end\nmarket for large-sized panels is concentrated among a limited number of major panel manufacturers. We also market\nour products directly to monitor, notebook and mobile device manufacturers so that our products can be qualified for\ntheir specifications and designed into their products. Furthermore, we extend our business development with system\nand ODM companies by using strategic ASIC business model to not only develop ASIC product based on customer\nspecification but also jointly research and develop new technologies to meet customers' future product demand.\nAdditionally, we form strategic partnership with tier-1 customers for our LCoS microdisplays, 3D sensing and AI\nimage sensing to penetrate into the emerging market. We believe we need close alliance with our customers to build\nup ecosystem for new applications.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales teams located in Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.\nWe also have dedicated sales teams for certain of our most important current or prospective customers. We have\noffices in Tainan, Hsinchu, Taipei, Taiwan; and Shenzen and Suzhou, China. We have other sales and technical\n46\nsupport offices in Hefei, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Foshan, Fuqing, Ningbo, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu,\nXi’an and Xiamen, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South Korea, Givatayim, Israel; and Irvine\nand Campbell, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, all in close proximity to our customers. For certain\nproducts or regions, we may sell our products through agents or distributors.\nOur sales and marketing team possesses a high level of technical expertise and industry knowledge used to\nsupport a lengthy and complex sales process. This includes a highly trained team of product managers and field\napplications engineers. Our team is equipped with extensive strategic marketing experience and a strong capability\nto identify market trends. We also provide technical support and assistance to potential and existing customers in\nsystem/SoC architecture, designing, testing and qualifying display modules, camera modules and end application\nsystems that incorporate our products and ASICs. We believe that the depth and quality of this design support are\nkey to improving customers’ time-to-market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.\nManufacturing\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely on semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication, gold bumping,\nassembly and testing. We also rely largely on third-party suppliers of processed tape used in TAB packaging. We\nengage foundries with high-voltage CMOS process technology for our display drivers and engage assembly and\ntesting houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages, thereby taking advantage of the economies of scale and\nthe specialization of such semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to\ncapture certain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures,\nfixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the\nmost suitable for any given product.\nWe operate a fab under Himax Display primarily for performing manufacturing processes for our LCoS\nmicrodisplays. Moreover, for better integration, we also established an in-house color filter facility under Himax\nTaiwan, which commenced shipments from 2010. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our\nproprietary single-panel color LCoS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness\nof our LCoS products and creates value for our customers. In addition, we have established an in-house WLO\nfacility under Himax Taiwan for the key process of our wafer level optics products, which started small-scale\nshipments from December 2009 and commenced mass shipment to anchor customer from 2017 onwards. We began\nconstruction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the current headquarters to house additional\nWLO capacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our 3D sensing business and to provide extra office\nspace. The construction of Fab 2 was completed in the first half of 2018.\nManufacturing Stages\nThe diagram below sets forth the various stages in manufacturing display drivers according to the two different\ntypes of assembly utilized: TAB or COG. The assembly type depends primarily on the application and design of the\npanel and is determined by our customers.\n47\nWafer Fabrication: Based on our design, the foundry provides us with fabricated wafers. Each fabricated wafer\ncontains many chips, each known as a die.\nGold Bumping: After the wafers are fabricated, they are delivered to gold bumping houses where gold bumps\nare plated on each wafer. The gold bumping process uses thin film metal deposition, photolithography and\nelectrical plating technologies. The gold bumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die to the processed\ntape, in the case of TAB package, or the glass, in the case of COG package.\nChip Probe Testing: Each die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded.\nAssembly and Testing: Our display drivers use two types of assembly technology: TAB or COG. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and to a lesser extent COG package\ntypes,whereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products typically require COG\npackage types.\nTAB Assembly\nWe use two types of TAB technologies: TCP and COF. TCP and COF packages are both made of processed\ntape that is typically 35mm or 48mm wide, plated with copper foil and has a circuit formed within it. TCP and\nCOF packages differ, however, in terms of their chip connections. With TCP packages, a hole is punched through\nthe processed tape in the area of the chip, which is connected to a flying lead made of copper. By contrast, with\nCOF packages, the lead is mounted directly on the processed tape and there is no flying lead. In recent years, COF\npackages have become predominantly used in TAB technology.\n• Inner-Lead Bonding: The TCP and COF assembly process involves grinding the bumped wafers into their\nrequired thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies, or chips. An inner lead bonder machine connects\nthe chip to the printed circuit processed tape and the package is sealed with resin at high temperatures.\n48\n• Final Testing: The assembled display drivers are tested to ensure that they meet performance specifications.\nTesting takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each product.\nCOG Assembly\nCOG assembly connects display drivers directly to LCD panels without the need for processed tape. COG\nassembly involves grinding the tested wafers into their required thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies,\nor chips. Each individual die is picked and placed into a chip tray and is then visually or auto-inspected for defects.\nThe dies are packed within a tray in an aluminum bag after completion of the inspection process.\nQuality Assurance\nWe maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system. Using a variety of methods, from conducting rigorous\nsimulations during the circuit design process to evaluating supplier performance at various stages of our products’\nmanufacturing process, we seek to bring about improvements and achieve customer satisfaction. In addition to\nmonitoring customer satisfaction through regular reviews, we implement extensive supplier quality controls so that\nthe products we outsource achieve our high standards. Prior to engaging a third party as our supplier, we perform\na series of audits on their operations, and upon engagement, we hold frequent quality assurance meetings with\nour suppliers to evaluate such factors as product quality, production costs, technological sophistication and timely\ndelivery.\nIn November 2002, we received ISO 9001 certification, which was renewed in March 2021 and will expire in\nMarch 2024. In February 2006, we received ISO 14001 certification, which was renewed in December 2020 and\nwill expire in December 2023. In addition, in March 2007, we received IECQ QC 080000 certification, which was\nrenewed in February 2019 and will expire in March 2022.\nEnvironmental Management System and Safety and Health Management System\nHimax follows closely the global environmental trends, including energy saving and waste reduction, in its daily\noperations. The Company is certified in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14064.\nHimax is a leader in its sector when it comes to the environment and safety, operating under measures much\nmore stringent than domestic regulations. The Company aims to grow sustainably, delivering economic, social and\nenvironmental benefits with its healthy employees.\nHimax has also been tirelessly reducing impacts to the environment and improving safety in its operations,\nspecifically targeting product design and waste handling.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Service Providers and Suppliers\nThrough our relationships with leading foundries, assembly, gold bumping and testing houses and processed\ntape suppliers, we believe we have established a supply chain that enables us to deliver high-quality products to our\ncustomers in a timely manner.\nAccess to semiconductor manufacturing service providers is critical as display drivers require high-voltage\nCMOS process technology and specialized assembly and testing services, all of which are different from industry\nstandards. We have obtained our foundry services from TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, Macronix, Globalfoundries\nSingapore, PSMC, Nexchip and SKHYSI in the past few years. These are among a select number of semiconductor\nmanufacturers that provide high-voltage CMOS process technology required for manufacturing display drivers.\nWe engage assembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages such as Chipbond, Chipmore\nInternational trading company Ltd., ChipMOS Technologies Inc., Nepes Corporation and King Yuan Electronics\nCo., Ltd.\nWe plan to strengthen our relationships with our existing semiconductor manufacturing service providers and diversify\nour network of such service providers in order to ensure access to sufficient cost-competitive and high-quality manufacturing\ncapacity. We are selective in our choice of semiconductor manufacturing service providers. It takes a substantial amount of\ntime to qualify alternative foundries, gold bumping, assembly and testing houses for production. As a result, we expect that\nwe will continue to rely on a limited number of semiconductor manufacturing service providers for a substantial portion of\nour manufacturing requirements in the near future.\n49\nThe table below sets forth (in alphabetical order) our principal semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders and suppliers:\nWafer Fabrication Gold Bumping\nGlobalfoundries Singapore Pte., Ltd.

We have also expanded certain facilities for LCoS and WLO products\nto accommodate new customers and new applications located at our headquarters in Tainan, Taiwan. In addition,\nHimax Taiwan owns and operates a fab with 1,431 square meters of floor space in a building leased from Innolux\nin Tainan, where it established an in-house color filter facility that commenced shipments from 2010. This in-house\nfacility provides color filter for CMOS image sensor and LCoS products. The color filter line is a critical and unique\nprocess for our proprietary single-panel color LCoS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the\ncompetitiveness of our color-filter LCoS microdisplays products and creates value for our customers.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and\ntheir accompanying notes included elsewhere herein which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n5.A. Operating Results\nFor discussion related to our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and the results of operations for\n2020 compared to 2019, refer to Part I, Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects, in our Annual Report\non Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the United States Securities and\nExchange Commission on March 31, 2021.\nOverview\nWe are a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. We\nare a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile\nphones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer\nelectronics devices. Additionally, we design and provide controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and\nDisplay Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, and LCoS\nmicro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. We also offer\nCMOS image sensors, wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and ultralow power AI image sensing, which\nare used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security,\nmedical devices, home appliance, AIoT, etc. For display drivers and display-related products, our customers are\npanel manufacturers, agents or distributors, module manufacturers and assembly houses. We also work with camera\nmodule manufacturers, optical engine manufacturers, and television system manufacturers for various non-driver\nproducts.\nWe commenced operations through our predecessor, Himax Taiwan, in June 2001. We must, among other things,\ncontinue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product portfolio, maintain our leading technology\nposition, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate declining average selling\nprices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover, we must continue to address\nthe challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and retaining managerial, engineering,\noperational and financial personnel and implementing and improving our existing administrative, financial and\noperations systems.\n54\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication,\ngold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCoS microdisplay, wafer level optics\nproducts and active alignment for 3D sensing, which we manufacture through our own factories. We are able to take\nadvantage of the economies of scale and the specialization of our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture certain financial and operational benefits, including\nreduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to\nuse the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given product. For LCoS microdisplay\nand wafer level optics products, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies and\nmanufacturing expertise in the effort to further expand these businesses.\nAs our semiconductors are critical components of flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the trends\nand developments of the flat panel display industry, in particular, the TFT-LCD panel segment. The majority of our\nrevenues in 2021 were derived from sales of display drivers that were eventually incorporated into TFT-LCD panels.\nWe expect display drivers for TFT-LCD panels to continue to be our primary products. The TFT-LCD panel industry\nis intensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD\npanels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in downward pricing pressure on our products.\nSee “Item 3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business—We\nderive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical and\nsubject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business or results\nof operations.” The revenue expansion of our non-driver products as well as TFT-LCD product trending toward high\nresolution and any other new product introduction help to mitigate these risks.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur business, financial position and results of operations, as well as the period-to-period comparability of our\nfinancial results, are significantly affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n• average selling prices;\n• unit shipments;\n• product mix;\n• design wins;\n• cost of revenues and cost reductions;\n• supply chain management;\n• share-based compensation expenses and cash awards; and\n• tax credits.\nAverage Selling Prices\nOur performance is affected by the selling prices of each of our products. We price our products based on\nseveral factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage of the product, competition, technical complexity of\nthe product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer. We typically are able to charge the\nhighest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are able to raise our selling\nprices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline over a product’s life cycle,\nwhich may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such as constraints in foundry capacity.\nFor example, from 2020, the industry-wide tightening of foundry capacity has extended to backend facilities that\ninclude assembly and testing and appears to be a long-term phenomenon. Robust demand pushed foundry capacity\nconstraints to a more severe level and rose higher material cost which in turn enabled higher average selling prices.\nThe general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling prices of semiconductors to decline\nover a product’s life cycle due to competition, production efficiencies, emergence of substitutes and technological\nobsolescence. Our cost reduction efforts also contribute to this decline in average selling prices. See “—Cost of\nRevenues and Cost Reductions.”\n55\nOur average selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. As new China panel\nmakers emerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their capacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will\nincrease accordingly, negatively impacting our average selling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by\nthe packaging type our customers choose as well as the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below.\nLastly, competition level affects our average selling prices as well. However, the impact of declining average selling\nprices on our profitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent by increased volume as lower prices may\nstimulate demand and thereby drive sales and TFT-LCD panel products trending toward higher resolution.\nUnit Shipments\nOur performance is also affected by the number of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As our display\ndrivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our unit shipments depend primarily on our customers’\npanel shipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since our inception primarily as a result\nof our increased market share with certain major customers and their increased shipments of panels. Our growth\nin unit shipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels which typically require more display\ndrivers. However, the development of higher channel display drivers or new technologies, if successful, could\npotentially reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel while achieving the same resolution. If\nsuch technologies become commercially available, the market for our display drivers will be reduced and we could\nexperience a decline in revenue and profit. Our unit shipments also depend on the capacity we can get from our\nfoundry, assembly and testing house. Our growth was constrained by the severe foundry capacity shortage from\n2020.\nProduct Mix\nThe proportion of our revenues that is generated from the sale of different product types, also referred to as\nproduct mix, also affects our average selling prices, revenues and profitability. Our display driver products vary\ndepending on, among other things, the number of output channels, the level of integration and the package type.\nVariations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices of such products. For example,\nthe trend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products with a higher number of channels,\nwhich typically command higher average selling prices than traditional products with a lower number of channels.\nHowever, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically require fewer display drivers per panel. As a result,\nour profitability will be adversely affected to the extent that the decrease in the number of display drivers required\nfor each panel is not offset by increased total unit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers\nwith a higher number of channels. The level of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices,\nas more highly integrated chips typically have higher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected\nby changes in the package types used by our customers. For example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has\nlower material costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover, our different non-driver products vary in\naverage selling prices and costs.\nThe proportion of non-driver business would also affect our financial position and results of operations. For\nthe past few years, we have experienced operating losses from our non-driver business. This was partly due to\nlow sales volume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to fully cover expenses such as research and\ndevelopment and operating expenses. We expect, however, to ramp up the volume production and sales of our\nnon-driver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-driver products. Typically,\nour non-driver products have higher gross margins as well as higher growth potential than our driver products, we\nexpect the overall profit margin across our product platform to improve.\nDesign Wins\nAchieving design wins is important to our business, and it affects our unit shipments. Design wins occur when\na customer incorporates our products into their product designs. There are numerous opportunities for design wins,\nincluding, but not limited to, when panel manufacturers:\n• introduce new models to improve the cost and/or performance of their existing products or to expand their\nproduct portfolio;\n• establish new fabs and seek to qualify existing or new component suppliers; and\n• replace existing display driver companies due to cost or performance reasons.\n56\nDesign wins are not binding commitments by customers to purchase our products. However, we believe that\nachieving design wins is an important performance indicator. Our customers typically devote substantial time and\nresources to designing their products as well as qualifying their component suppliers and their products. Once our\nproducts have been designed into a system, the customer may be reluctant to change its component suppliers due to\nthe significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier or a replacement component. Therefore, we\nstrive to work closely with current and prospective customers in order to anticipate their requirements and product\nroadmaps and achieve additional design wins.\nCost of Revenues and Cost Reductions\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2019,\n2020 and 2021 was 79.5%, 75.1% and 51.6%, respectively. In 2021, as a percentage of Himax Taiwan’s total\nmanufacturing costs, the cost of wafer fabrication was 58.7%, the cost of processed tape was 7.2%, the cost of\nassembly and testing was 33.5%, and overhead was 0.6%. Our cost of revenues may increase as a result of an\nincrease in raw material prices, any failure to obtain sufficient foundry, assembly or testing capacity or any shortage\nof processed tape or failure to improve our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield. As a result, our ability\nto manage our wafer fabrication costs, costs for processed tape, assembly and testing costs and our manufacturing\nutilization rate or production yield is critical to our performance. In addition, to mitigate declining average selling\nprices, we aim to reduce unit costs by, among other things:\n• improving product design (e.g., having smaller die size allows for a larger number of dies on each wafer,\nthereby reducing the cost of each die);\n• improving manufacturing yields through our close collaboration with our semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers and in our in-house manufacturing facilities; and\n• achieving better pricing from a diversified pool of semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\nsuppliers, reflecting our ability to leverage our scale, volume requirements and close relationships as well\nas our strategy of sourcing from multiple service providers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Management\nDue to the competitive nature of the flat panel display industry and our customers’ need to maintain high capacity\nutilization in order to reduce unit costs per panel, any delays in the delivery of our products could significantly\ndisrupt our customers’ operations. To deliver our products on a timely basis and meet the quality standards\nand technical specifications our customers require, we must have assurances of high-quality capacity from our\nsemiconductor manufacturing service providers. We therefore strive to manage our supply chain by maintaining\nclose relationships with our key semiconductor manufacturing service providers and strive to provide credible\nforecasts of capacity demand and seek for new manufacturing service providers in case of any manufacturer’s\ncapacity shortage. Any disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our performance and could result in a\nloss of customers as well as potentially damage our reputation.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses and Cash Awards\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected\nby, our share-based compensation expenses and cash awards, which consist of charges taken relating to grants of\nmainly RSUs as well as stock options, non-vested shares, and cash awards to employees.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs). We adopted two long-term incentive plans in October 2005 and September 2011,\nrespectively, which permit the grant of options or RSUs to our employees and non-employees where each unit\nrepresents two ordinary shares. The actual awards will be determined by our compensation committee. The 2005\nplan was terminated in October 2010. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding RSUs under the\nlong-term incentive plan totaling $0.1 million, $4.8 million and $23.8 million in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nOf the total share-based compensation expenses recognized, nil, $4.8 million and $23.2 million in 2019, 2020\nand 2021, respectively, were settled in cash. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based\npayments at fair value.\n57\nSet forth below is a summary of our historical share-based compensation plans for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020 and 2021 as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. However, we did not grant RSUs in 2019\nbut granted stock options to employees instead.\nWe made grants of 1,208,785 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2016. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 91.93% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$9.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 580,235 RSUs to our employees on September 29, 2017. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 96.91% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $6.1\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 97.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $3.8\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,402,714 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2020. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 98.68% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$4.8 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 2,604,545 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2021. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 85.63% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$23.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nThe amount of share-based compensation expense with regard to the RSUs granted to our employees on\nSeptember 28, 2016, September 29, 2017, September 26, 2018, September 28, 2020 and September 28, 2021 was\n$8.30 per ADS, $10.93 per ADS, $5.76 per ADS, $3.44 per ADS and $10.39 per ADS, respectively, which was based\non the trading price of our ADSs on that day.\nEmployee stock options. We made grants of 2,226,690 units of stock option to purchase 2,226,690 units ADS\nto certain employees at an exercise price of $2.27 on September 30, 2019. The vesting schedule was that 50% of\nthe options vest half year after the date of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant. During\n2020, 114,500 units, 39,000 units and 10,000 units of stock option to purchase 114,500 units, 39,000 units and\n10,000 units ADS were grant to certain employees at an exercise price of $2.74, $3.9 and $3.35 on March 31, 2020,\nAugust 11, 2020 and September 25, 2020, respectively. The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1,\n2020. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding stock options under the long-term incentive plan\ntotaling $0.3 million and $0.7 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nCash Awards. We made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million to the Company’s employees\namong which $1.6 million was immediately vested on September 28, 2021. The remainder will be equally vested at\nthe first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date.\nTax Credits\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected\nby, tax credits available to us.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and development\nexpenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15% of the total qualifying\nresearch and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for\nthe current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for Industrial Innovation may not be\ncarried forward.\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended\n58\nto December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the\nincome tax payable for each year.\nDescription of Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items\nRevenues\nHistorically, we have generated revenues from sales of display drivers for large-sized applications and display\ndrivers for small and medium-sized applications. In addition, our product portfolio includes operational amplifiers,\ntiming controllers, touch controller ICs, LCoS microdisplay, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors, 3D\nsensing, ultralow power AI image sensing, wafer level optics products and ASIC service.\nRevenues from large-sized application totaled $397.9 million in 2021, an increase of 65.3% year-over-year,\nrepresenting 25.7% of our total revenues, as compared to 27.1% of our total revenues in 2020. During the Covid-19\npandemic, the surge in IT demand boosted the sales of monitor display drivers and notebook display drivers. TV\nsales were also up despite the dip in worldwide TV shipments during the second half of 2021.\nRevenues from small and medium-sized applications totaled $963.5 million in 2021, the highest growth of 86.8%\nyear-over-year, representing 62.3% of our total revenues, as compared to 58.1% of our total revenues in 2020. As\nleading Android tablet brands all adopted our TDDI solutions and automotive displays continued to evolve at a rapid\nrate in the number, size and sophistication, we saw the extraordinary business momentum for both product areas in\n2021.\nRevenues from non-driver products totaled $185.7 million in 2021, an increase of 42.0% year-over-year,\nrepresenting 12.0% of our total revenues, as compared to 14.8% of our total revenues a year ago. The year-over-year\nincrease was mainly from TCON amidst the growing need for high frame rate and high-resolution displays, and CIS,\nseverely capped by capacity constraint throughout 2021, due to the continuous strong demand in notebook and web\ncamera for work-from-home and online education. This increase was offset by WLO, as the legacy product of an\nanchor customer gradually decreased.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenues by amount and our revenues as a\npercentage of revenues by each product line:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nDisplay drivers for large-sized\napplications $ 237,276 35.3 $ 240,789 27.1 $ 397,905 25.7\nDisplay drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications 307,451 45.8 515,733 58.1 963,537 62.3\nNon-driver products(1) 127,108 18.9 130,760 14.8 185,655 12.0\nTotal $ 671,835 100.0 $ 887,282 100.0 $ 1 ,547,097 100.0\nNote: (1) Includes, among other things, timing controllers, touch controller ICs, LCoS projector solutions,\npower management IC, CMOS image sensors, programmable gamma OP, wafer level optics (WLO)\nproducts, ultralow power AI image sensing, NRE incomes, and ASIC service.\nA limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues. For example, Customer A and its\naffiliates accounted for 29.5%, 32.6% and 32.1% of our revenues in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Customer C\naccounted for 5.6%, 12.7% and 19.1% of our revenues in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n59\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCustomer A and its affiliates $ 198,430 29.5 $ 289,663 32.6 $ 497,083 32.1\nCustomer C 37,631 5.6 112,504 12.7 295,217 19.1\nOthers 435,774 64.9 485,115 54.7 754,797 48.8\nTotal $ 671,835 100.0 $ 887,282 100.0 $ 1,547,097 100.0\nThe global TFT-LCD panel market is highly concentrated, with only a limited number of TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers producing large-sized TFT-LCD panels in high volumes. We sell large-sized panel display drivers\nto many of these TFT-LCD panel manufacturers. Our revenues, therefore, will depend on our ability to capture an\nincreasingly larger percentage of each panel manufacturer’s display driver requirements. The sales to panel makers\nin China have become a significant portion of our revenue due to the Chinese panel maker business expansion which\nstarted in 2011. We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales to Asia-based customers whose end products\nare sold worldwide. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, approximately 19.2%, 13.9% and 14.2% of our revenues, respectively,\nwere from customers headquartered in Taiwan and approximately 70.3%, 79.7% and 81.5% of our revenues,\nrespectively, were from customers headquartered in China. We believe that substantially all of our revenues will\ncontinue to be from customers located in Asia, where almost all of the TFT-LCD panel manufacturers and mobile\ndevice module manufacturers are located. As a result of the regional customer concentration, we expect to continue\nto be subject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in Asia. A substantial\nmajority of our sales invoices are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of revenues, research and development expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses and share-based compensation expenses. Costs would be\ngreatly affected by product mix.\nCost of Revenues\nThe principal items of our cost of revenues are:\n• cost of wafer fabrication;\n• cost of processed tape used in TAB packaging;\n• cost of gold bumping, assembly and testing; and\n• other costs and expenses.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductors and semiconductor solutions to semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers. The costs of wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing depend on\nthe availability of capacity and demand for such services. The wafer fabrication industry, in particular, is highly\ncyclical, resulting in fluctuations in the price of processed wafers depending on the available foundry capacity and\nthe demand for foundry services.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of research and development employee salaries, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, costs associated with prototype wafers, processed tape, masks, molding and tooling\nsets and depreciation on research and development equipment. We expect to continue increasing our spending\non research and development in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue to increase our research\nand development headcount and associated costs to pursue additional product development opportunities. As a\npercentage of revenues, our research and development expenses in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were17.1%, 13.8% and\n60\n9.8%, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of general and administrative employees,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, depreciation on buildings, office furniture and equipment and professional\nfees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we\nexpand our operations, hire additional administrative personnel, incur depreciation expenses in connection with the\nincrease in office equipment and Fab 2, and incur additional compliance costs required of a publicly listed company\nin the United States.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries of sales and marketing employees, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, travel expenses and product sample costs. We expect that our sales and marketing\nexpenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts over the next several years. However, we believe that as we\ncontinue to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies, our sales and marketing expenses may\ndecline over time as a percentage of our revenues.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur share-based compensation expenses consist of various forms of share-based compensation that we have\nhistorically issued to our employees and consultants, as well as share-based compensation issued to employees,\ndirectors and service providers under our 2005 and 2011 long-term incentive plans. The 2005 plan was terminated\nin October 2010. We allocate such share-based compensation expenses to the applicable cost of revenues and\nexpense categories as related services are performed. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Under\nthe long-term incentive plan, we granted RSUs on December 30, 2005 to our employees and directors and again\non September 29, 2006, September 26, 2007, September 29, 2008, September 28, 2009, September 28, 2010,\nSeptember 28, 2011, September 26, 2012, September 26, 2013, September 26, 2014, September 25, 2015, September\n28, 2016, September 29, 2017, September 26, 2018, September 28, 2020 and September 28, 2021 to our employees.\nWe did not grant RSUs in 2019 but granted stock options to employees instead. Share-based compensation expenses\nrecorded regarding RSUs under the long-term incentive plan totaled $0.1 million, $4.8 million and $23.8 million in\n2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses recorded regarding stock options under the\nlong-term incentive plan totaled $0.3 million, $0.7 million and nil in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Awards.\nWe made grants annual bonus by cash payouts totaling $47.7 million to the Company’s employees among which\n$1.6 million was immediately vested on September 28, 2021. The remainder will be equally vested at the first,\nsecond and third anniversaries of the grant date.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries are incorporated in different jurisdictions, we file separate\nincome tax returns. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains\ntax. Additionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.\nHowever, if the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we\nmay be determined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with\nthe Income Tax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject\nto withholding tax in the ROC. We recognize income taxes at the applicable statutory rates in accordance with\nthe jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are located and as adjusted for certain items including accumulated\nlosses carried forward, non-deductible expenses, research and development tax credits, as well as changes in our\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in\nthe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\n61\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and we use judgment and estimate to\ndetermine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period. Due to the rapid technological\nchanges, we estimate the net realizable value of inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of\nreporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon. The inventory\nwrite-downs in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were approximately $25.4 million, $11.9 million and $9.4 million, respectively,\nand were included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-financial Assets other than Goodwill\nWe routinely review our non-financial assets at the reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of\nimpairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount\nof an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing\nvalue in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. However, due to\nthe cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy, market requirements, or the needs of our\ncustomers, we may not always be in a position to accurately anticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or\nacquired technology until they occur. Although we have the recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we\nremain positive on the long-term prospect of our non-Driver product segment, judging by the expanding customer\nlist that covers some of the world’s biggest tech names, and the busy engineering activities going on with such\ncustomers. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we did not recognize any impairment loss on\nnon-financial assets.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the\ncash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each\nof the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss.\nAn impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The assessment of\nimpairment of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate\nthe goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating\nthe recoverable amount of relevant CGU, management is required to make subjective judgments in determining\nthe discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and\nexpenses related to the CGU.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, goodwill in Driver IC CGU and WLO CGU was $26,846 thousand and\n$1,292 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nAccording to the ROC Income Tax Act, dividends distributed by a Taiwan company to its foreign shareholders\nare subject to ROC withholding tax, currently at the rate of 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash\ndividends or on the par value of the ordinary shares in the case of stock dividends. The surtax rate for undistributed\nearnings is currently 5%. However, surtax paid on undistributed earnings can no longer be used to offset against the\nwithholding tax imposed on the dividend distributed to foreign shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not provided for retained earnings tax on the undistributed earnings\nof approximately $1,096.1 million of our subsidiaries since we have specific plans to reinvest these earnings\nindefinitely. The undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are mainly from Himax Taiwan totaling\napproximately $1,094.9 million as of December 31, 2021. We intend to use accumulated and future earnings of\nHimax Taiwan to expand operations in Taiwan.\n62\nHowever, a deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Taiwanese company can no longer demonstrate that\nit plans to reinvest indefinitely these undistributed earnings. This amount becomes taxable when we execute other\ninvestments, share buybacks or shareholder dividends to be funded by cash distribution by our foreign subsidiaries.\nIt is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on such undistributed earnings.\nWe are a holding company located in the Cayman Islands and have paid dividends and repurchased outstanding\nshares. To fund such dividends and repurchases, in the past years, we have received cash from bank loans and from\nHimax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings instead of dividends distributed by Himax Taiwan.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required to\nestimate income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities for us and our subsidiaries. This process involves\nestimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of\nitems for tax and accounting purposes and the amount of tax credits and tax loss carry-forward. These differences\nresult in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated statements of financial position.\nManagement must then assess deferred tax assets at each reporting date and reduce to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future\ntaxable profits improves.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of profit or loss as a percentage\nof revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nRevenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues 79.5 75.1 51.6\nResearch and development 17.1 13.8 9.8\nGeneral and administrative 3.5 2.7 1.9\nSales and marketing 2.6 1.9 1.5\nTotal costs and expenses 102.7 93.5 64.8\nOperating income (loss) (2.7) 6.5 35.2\nNon-operating income (loss) 0.4 (0.1) -\nIncome tax expense 0.1 1.3 7.2\nProfit (loss) for the year (2.4) 5.1 28.0\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.2 0.2\nProfit (loss) attributable to Himax stockholders (2.0) 5.3 28.2\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nRevenues. Our revenues increased by 74.4% to $1,547.1 million in 2021 from $887.3 million in 2020. The\nincrease was due to the strong demand across all of our major business segments, namely large-sized display drivers,\nsmall and medium-sized display drivers and non-driver products:\n• Large-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from display drivers for large-sized application grew by 65.3%\nto $397.9 million in 2021 from $240.8 million in 2020. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the surge in IT\ndemand boosted the notebook display IC sales and monitor display sales. TV sales were also up despite\nthe dip in worldwide TV shipments during the second half of 2021.\n• Small and Medium-sized Display Drivers. Revenues from small and medium-sized display drivers\nincreased significantly by 86.8% to $963.5 million in 2021 from $515.7 million in 2020. The Company\nsaw extraordinary business momentum particularly in tablet and automotive areas in 2021 as leading\nnon-iOS tablet brands all adopted our tablet TDDI solutions and automotive displays continued to evolve\nat a rapid rate in the number, size and sophistication.\n63\n• Non-Driver Products. Revenues from non-driver products increased by 42.0% to $185.7 million in 2021\nfrom $130.8 million in 2020. The increase was mainly from Tcon sales amidst the growing needs for high\nframe rate and high-resolution displays. CMOS image sensor business, severely capped by capacity constraint\nthroughout 2021, was up from the strong demand in notebook and web camera for work-from-home and online\neducation. This increase was offset by WLO, as the legacy product of a major customer gradually decreased.\nCosts and Expenses. Costs and expenses increased by 20.8% to $1,002.1 million in 2021 from $829.4 million\nin 2020. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses decreased to 64.8% in 2021 compared to 93.5% in 2020.\n• Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $798.5 million in 2021 from $666.5 million in 2020, which\nwas generally in line with our overall business growth. The increase in cost of revenues was also attributable\nto the rising material costs across wafer foundry, assembly and testing, which underwent severe capacity\nshortages. Inventory write-downs, which are included in cost of revenues, decreased to $9.4 million in 2021\nfrom $11.9 million in 2020. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 51.6% in 2021 from\n75.1% in 2020, mainly due to a reflection of more favorable IC pricing and product mix resulting from the\ntight foundry capacity as well as increasing contribution from high margin product lines.\n• Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 23.8%to $151.4 million in\n2021 from $122.3 million in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to increase in the salary expense,\nRSU compensation and cash awards. The increase in salary expense was due primarily to a larger headcount\nof research and development staff, higher average salaries and NT dollar appreciation against US dollar as we\npay the bulk of our employee salaries in NT dollars.\n• General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 22.4% to $29.3 million in\n2020 from $23.9 million in 2020, primarily as a result of increases in salary expense, RSU compensation, cash\nawards and professional fee.\n• Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 37.3% to $22.9 million in 2021 from $16.7\nmillion in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to increase in salary expense, RSU compensation\nand cash awards.\nNon-Operating Income (loss). We had net non-operating loss of $0.4 million in 2021 compared to $1.1 million in\n2020. The decrease was primarily due to decrease in finance cost and increase in foreign currency exchange gains but\npartially offset by an increase in share of losses of associates.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense increased to $110.7 million in 2021 from $11.7 million in 2020.\nThe increase in our income tax expense was primarily attributable to the increase in pre-tax profit $544.6 million in\n2021 from $56.9 million in 2020.\nProfit for the year. As a result of the foregoing, our profit for the year of $433.9 million in 2021, versus $45.2\nmillion in 2020, and profit attributable to Himax stockholders of $436.9 million in 2021, versus $47.1 million in\n2020.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth the revenues and operating results for our reportable segments for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n( in thousands)\nSegment Revenues\nDriver IC $ 544,727 $ 756,522 $ 1,361,442\nNon-Driver Products 127,108 130,760 185,655\nTotal $ 671,835 $ 887,282 $ 1,547,097\n64\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(in thousands)\nSegment Operating Income (loss)\nDriver IC $ 29,070 $ 98,687 $ 551,943\nNon-Driver Products (47,377) (40,761) (6,922)\nTotal $ (18,307) $ 57,926 $ 545,021\nDriver IC Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Driver IC segment increased by 80.0% to $1,361.4 million in 2021\nfrom $756.5 million in 2020. The increase was mainly from the significant growth of 86.8% in display drivers for\nsmall and medium-sized applications with sales totaling $963.5 million.\nSegment operating income. Operating income from the Driver IC segment increased to $551.9 million in 2021\nfrom $98.7 million in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues and higher gross\nmargin.\nNon-Driver Products Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Non-Driver Products segment increased by 42.0% to $185.7 million\nin 2021 from $130.8 million in 2020. The year-over-year increase was mainly from increased revenues generated\nfrom TCON amidst the growing need for high frame rate and high-resolution displays, but partially offset by WLO\ndecreased.\nSegment operating loss. Operating loss from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased to $6.9 million in\n2021 from $40.8 million in 2020. The narrowed operating loss decreases were attributable mainly to the increase in\nrevenues and higher gross margin.\n5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe need cash primarily for technology advancement, capacity expansion, paying dividends and working capital.\nWe have historically been able to meet our cash requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings to\npay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total current assets of $1,192.8 million, total current liabilities of $601.2\nmillion and cash and cash equivalents of $336.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had short-term secured\nborrowings of $151.4 million with cash and time deposits of $151.4 million as collateral, and long-term unsecured\nborrowings of $52.5 million, of which $6.0 million was current portion. For enhancing the guaranty, our land,\nbuilding and improvements of Fab 2 totaling $67.8 million were pledged as collateral for the long-term unsecured\nborrowings. As of December 31, 2021, we had total unused short-term credit lines of $277.4 million, of which $21.7\nmillion will expire before the end of March 2022, and $155.6 million belonging to the parent company, Himax\nTechnologies, Inc., needs to be secured with equal amount of cash and time deposits when borrowing money from\nbanks. Further, we had unused long-term credit lines of $40 million. We believe that our existing short-term and\nlong-term credit lines, together with cash generated from our operations, are sufficient to liquidity needs. We expect\nto meet our present working capital requirements through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings from time\nto time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 7,656 $ 102,610 $ 388,276\n65\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in investing activities (47,767) (22,365) (232,680)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 35,261 3,261 (4,487)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (5,382) 83,883 151,086\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 106,437 101,055 184,938\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period 101,055 184,938 336,024\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $388.3 million compared to $102.6\nmillion in 2020. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was mainly due to improved\nprofitability over time.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was $232.7 million compared to $22.4 million\nin 2020. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to an increase of $199.1 million in\nrefundable deposits made for the purpose of securing foundry capacity amidst the global semiconductor capacity\nshortage.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities in 2021 was $4.5 million compared to net cash\nprovided by $3.3 million in 2020. This change was due primarily to increases in distribution of cash dividends,\nrepayment of long-term unsecured borrowings and payment of lease liabilities but partially offset by an increase of\nguarantee deposits received from customers.\nOur liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products that are subject to\nrapid technological change, among other factors, which could result in revenue variability in future periods.\nIn addition, we have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of our customers. The extension\nof payment terms for our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results.\nOur subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends and other payments to us may be limited by ROC regulations.\nSee “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Holding Company Structure — Our ability to receive dividends and\nother payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and\nthereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and\notherwise fund and conduct our business.”\nTo address the continuing foundry capacity shortage worldwide, we have entered into strategic agreements with\nour foundry partners in order to secure their foundry capacity to fulfill our business needs. We anticipate continuing\nto enter into additional strategic agreements with new foundry partners to secure additional foundry capacity.\nUnder these strategic agreements, we are committed to purchasing a specific volume at fixed prices or variable\nprices. Some of our customers, and even our indirect customers, are also entering into similar strategic agreements\nto secure their IC supplies with us. However, there can be no assurance that these prices provided in the strategic\nagreements with our foundry partners and our customers will always remain competitive during the contract term.\nFor example, in the event that the global semiconductor market changes due to foundry capacity expansion and/or\nshrunken customer demand, the fixed prices we agree to pay our foundry partners may become significantly higher\nthan the then prevailing market price. On the other hand, if there continues to be foundry capacity shortages and/or\nincreases in customer demand, the fixed prices our customers agree to pay us may become significantly lower than\nthe then prevailing market price. Any of those situations could materially adversely impact our pricing strategies,\ncompetitive position, profitability and results of operation. We may also be subject to contractual penalties if we are\nunable to purchase the committed volume from our foundry partners. In addition, since these strategic agreements\nwith our foundry partners typically require us to make prepayments or refundable deposits to such foundry partners,\nour cash flow, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected. Nevertheless, we believe these strategic\nagreements will enable us to meet our customers’ unaddressed demands and are in the best interest of our company\namid the global foundry capacity shortage.\nWe have entered into several wafer fabrication or assembly and testing service arrangements or multi-year\npurchase agreements with suppliers. We may be obligated to make payments for purchase orders entered into\npursuant to these arrangements. Our purchase obligations also include agreements to purchase goods or services,\nprimarily inventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including\nfixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of\nthe transaction. Among all these purchase agreements, the longest termination term shall expire in 2028. Purchase\nobligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Contractual obligations resulting from above\n66\npurchase orders and agreements with known amounts approximate $2,655 million as of December 31, 2021. Of\nobligations under above purchase orders and agreements, $628 million is expected to be paid in the next 12 months.\nOur capital expenditures were incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of property and equipment.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $45.9 million, $5.8 million and $7.6 million in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively,\nhigher than usual capital expenditure due to our Fab 2 construction and WLO capacity expansion in 2019. Capital\nexpenditures of $7.6 million in 2021 was mainly for design tools, R&D related equipment as well as in-house tester\nof our traditional IC design business.\nThe capex budget will be funded through our internal resources and banking facilities, if so needed. We will\ncontinue to make capital expenditures to meet the expected growth of our operations. We believe that our working\ncapital and borrowings under our existing and future credit lines should be sufficient for our present requirements.\n5.C. Research and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our core technologies and know-how\nrelating to the semiconductor solutions we offer to the flat panel display industry. In particular, we have committed\na significant portion of our resources to the research and development of non-driver products because we believe\nin the long-term business prospects of such products and are committed to continuing to diversify our product\nportfolio. Although a significant portion of the resources at our integrated circuit design center are invested in\nadvanced research for future products, we continue to invest in improving the performance and reducing the costs of\nour existing products. Our application engineers, who provide on-system verification of semiconductors and product\nspecifications, and field application engineers, who provide on-site engineering support at our customers’ offices\nor factories, work closely with panel manufacturers to co-develop display solutions for their electronic devices. In\n2019, 2020 and 2021, we incurred research and development expenses of $114.9 million, $122.3 million and $151.4\nmillion, respectively, representing 17.1%, 13.8% and 9.8% of our revenues, respectively.\n5.D. Trend Information\nThe strong business we experienced in 2021 was a result of our effort in securing solid capacity, a steadfast focus\non optimizing product mix as well as solidifying strategic relationship with both customers and suppliers. All of\nthese factors contributed to the record sales and profit margins. The ongoing effects of the pandemic, coupled with\nfoundry capacity shortage, created a challenging operating environment, yet also provided favorable conditions for\nIC vendors such as us with overall market demand far outpacing supply. Among our three major product categories,\nsmall and medium-sized display drivers posted the highest growth in 2021 and we saw extraordinary business\nmomentum particularly in tablet and automotive areas as leading non-iOS tablet brands all adopted our tablet\nTDDI solutions and automotive displays continued to evolve at a rapid rate in the number, size and sophistication.\nAutomotive sales enjoyed the highest growth among all product lines and sales for tablet IC was our top sales\ncontributor in 2021. In addition, the surge in IT demand boosted our notebook display IC sales significantly in 2021,\nwhereas monitor display sales increased and TV sales also up despite the dip in worldwide TV shipments during\nthe second half of 2021. Non-driver sales also enjoyed decent growth derived mainly from Tcon sales due to the\ngrowing needs for high frame rate and high-resolution displays. We are also glad to see our ultralow power AI image\nsensing total solution successfully entered into mass production in fourth quarter of 2021 for a major tech name\nover a mainstream application. We reached this major milestone just one year after we delivered the first samples, a\nremarkable achievement and an illustration of the robustness of our AI solution. We expect to see more design-wins\nawarded across a broad customer base and a high variety of applications leading to robust sales growth for this new\nhigh margin product line.\nAs we look ahead, we expect the supply-demand imbalance to continue throughout 2022, especially on the\nmature nodes that we are primarily anchored to. Himax has been proactive in this regard, continuing to pursue new\npartnerships and agreements to increase our available capacity and achieve our 2022 business goals. We are upbeat\nabout our year ahead growth prospect, backed by a few product areas, notably the automotive and ultralow power AI\nimage sensing businesses, which we feel confident will stay strong regardless of the macroeconomic concerns. We\nanticipate these two products, both with good gross margin, will outgrow other product lines in 2022.\nLarge-sized Display Driver IC Segment\nIn this segment, Himax is armed with a diversified and comprehensive product offering covering TV, monitor and\nnotebook, which provides us with the flexibility to take actions in tandem with our customers and suppliers to direct\nproduction towards the sectors with stronger demand.\n67\nForeseeing the continuation of the prevailing foundry shortage and the demand for advanced displays to\nremain strong, we continue to move toward higher end markets while providing advanced driver ICs and Tcons\nfor a one-stop shopping experience, focusing on higher end displays and premium models for the respective\nleading end customers in TV, monitor and notebook markets. We are also supporting further feature upgrades\nfor customers’ next generation products, including high-speed interface, low power consumption, higher refresh\nrate, ultra-large-sized, high-aspect-ratio and curved-view design. All these represent a high barrier of entry that\ndifferentiates us from China local competition.\nLooking into 2022, backed by tight strategic relationships with some of the leading end customers in TV, monitor\nand NB markets, our project design coverage across all markets with all major panel makers remains strong. With\nthe prevailing shortage expected to continue, especially given that much of the global large display driver ICs are\nstill manufactured on 8” wafer where the room for capacity expansion is extremely limited, we remain positive on\nthe prospect of our large display driver business.\nSmall and Medium-Sized Display Driver IC Segment\nHimax is already the market share leader in display driver IC for automotive and tablet. For automotive market,\nwe are deepening our working relationships with tier-1 players and end customers across all major markets. We\nexpect the automotive segment to be on track to become our single largest revenue contributor starting 2022\nwhere robust demand for our traditional automotive driver IC is backed by strong foundry capacity support, while\nautomotive TDDI is expected to experience exponential growth throughout 2022 and beyond. Our product roadmap\nas well as new design-wins with end customers and a foundry capacity advantage have positioned Himax to gain\nfurther market share. Himax dominates the design-in and design-win of automotive TDDI with direct and indirect\ncustomers across the continents for a technology that is essential for very large sized, stylish, and free-formed\nautomotive displays. We expect to reach 10 million units cumulative shipment in automotive TDDI in as soon as the\nsecond quarter of 2022. In addition to automotive TDDI, we are also leading in the up-and-coming local dimming\ntechnology which not only provides effective power saving, but also enhances display contrast for better viewing\nunder bright daylight. Last but not least, our high-speed P2P bridge and LTDI solutions are specially designed\nfor very large panels up to a pillar-to-pillar display size. With these new demands unleashed for advanced display\ntechnologies, we expect exponential sales growth of automotive sector in the years to come.\nTablet was one of our top sales contributors in 2021 thanks largely to the fast-rising TDDI penetration for\nnon-iOS names and the strong demand driven by the stay-at-home economy. To further broaden our product\noffering and solidify our market position, our tablet TDDI has moved toward higher frame rate, higher resolution,\nlarger screen size, and active stylus for better-quality handwriting and drawing. All these trends benefit us for\nhigher ASP and growing market share. We are also seeing fast expanding education tablets where our tablet TDDI\nwith active stylus feature has been widely adopted by several leading Chinese players. However, foundry capacity\nremains a major issue that adversely impacts our shipping capability. As our smartphone and tablet TDDIs share the\nsame process pool, we continued with our strategy to favor tablet TDDI shipment over smartphone as we are the\npreferred main or sole vendor for major non-iOS tablet names. Our traditional discrete driver IC into smartphone\nand tablet continue to be quickly replaced by TDDI as expected.\nHimax continues to gear up for the AMOLED driver IC development in partnership with major Chinese and\nKorean panel makers. In the first quarter of 2022, our flexible AMOLED driver and Tcon for automotive application\nsuccessfully ramped up for a customer’s flagship EV model. The number of awarded projects for our automotive\nAMOLED ICs is growing with further EV vendors. In addition, our AMOLED for tablet is expected to commence\nmass production in the second quarter of 2022 with Chinese panel makers. As for smartphone, we continue to\ncommit R&D resources to AMOLED driver ICs through engagement with top tier customers. In view of serious\nconstraints on AMOLED display driver capacity in the next few years, we have also secured meaningful capacity for\nsmartphone AMOLED drivers. We believe AMOLED driver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers\nfor our small and medium panel driver IC business.\nNon-Driver IC Segment\nThe non-driver category has been our most exciting growth area and a differentiator for the Company. We are\ndevoted to the development, manufacturing and marketing of non-driver products to diversify our customer base and\nproduct portfolio to offer total solutions of image processing and human interface related technologies in addition to\nour driver IC products. Our non-driver products delivered the strongest growth in 2014 owing to many new product\nlaunches and project wins. During 2016, our non-driver businesses experienced tremendous growth, primarily\n68\ndriven by the LCOS and WLO businesses due to shipments to one of our leading AR device customers. Additionally,\nour WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer. The\noverall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in more\nmodels. In 2021, we continued to fulfill anchor customer’s demand for the legacy product. The WLO technology\ncontinues to play an important role in shaping next generation optical applications. Our exceptional optical design\nknowledge, together with our production proven nanoimprinting capabilities and mass manufacturing experience,\nallow us to deliver high-quality solutions to meet the requirements of the future generation optical applications\nacross automotive, consumer, industrial, and medical applications.\nIn 3D sensing for non-smartphone applications, we provide customers who wish to design their own structured\nlight-based 3D sensing solution with our proprietary 3D decoder IC. Our 3D decoder can accelerate local image\nprocessing for face recognition and offer best-in-class security authentication. It was already certified by the leading\nChinese electronic payment standard with requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation and strict\nprivacy. The high-performance decoding capability for high-precision face recognition is particularly popular in\nareas such as door lock and industrial access control. We started volume shipment of the 3D decoder in the fourth\nquarter of 2020 with more design-win awards and growing volume throughout 2021.\nRegarding ultralow power AI image sensing, the demand for battery-powered smart devices with AI intelligent\nsensing is rapidly growing. Our AI image sensing solution is designed for a wide range of ultralow power use cases\nin consumer electronics that aim to modernize legacy end-point devices, which lack AI capability, with ultralow\npower computer vision AI. The AI solution is capable of processing data locally on the end device with just metadata\noutput while avoiding the need to transport massive data to the cloud, thereby improving response time, saving\nbandwidth and power and, last but not least, enhancing data security. The design-win with a top-tier name for a\nmainstream application entered into mass production in the fourth quarter of 2021. The number of awarded projects\nis also growing quickly, covering a broad range of applications, including notebook, home appliances, utility meter,\nautomotive, battery-powered surveillance camera, panoramic video conferencing, and medical. We are excited by\nthe potential opportunities presented by the edge-to-cloud platform collaboration, opening up new market frontiers\nfor us in areas such as smart city, smart office, healthcare, agriculture, retail and factory automation. We anticipate\nmore design-wins awards and growing volume shipments starting 2022.\nFor the other business model of our ultralow power AI image sensing where we provide key components, we\ncontinue to leverage our key partners to amplify our offering and encourage adoption of our ultralow power solution\nin AI communities, which also have strong appetites for ultralow power smart sensing AI. Being the official partner\nof prominent AI platforms such as Google TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers, Microsoft Azure, Arm AI Partner\nProgram, and tinyML Foundation, just to name a few, we get to enjoy the enormous network of these ecosystems\nand their numerous participants. We continue to receive inquiries from large corporations and individual developers\nalike with hundreds of evaluation boards and developments kits having been purchased online and distributed across\nthe globe.\nWe continued our marketing efforts through joint webinars and other online activities with several well-known\nplatform partners such as Edge Impulse, Digi-Key and SparkFun to broaden our AI solution’s market reach and\nestablish direct contacts with more AI developers. We are confident that ultralow power AI image sensing solution\nwill be one of the major growth drivers for our non-driver segment looking ahead into 2022 and beyond.\nOn timing controller, we are optimistic about the long-term growth prospect of the Tcon business where we\nhave successfully positioned ourselves for higher end and higher value-added areas including 4K/8K TV, gaming\nmonitor, and low power notebook in view of consumers’ pursuance of various new types of entertainment for film,\ntelevision and gaming. In addition, we extend our Tcon product reach into automotive and gaming TV markets. Our\ncutting-edge automotive local dimming Tcon has won numerous awards and penetrated into OEMs and tier-1 car\nmakers’ new premium models, with some of them slated for mass production starting the second quarter of 2022.\nIn the gaming TV market, we are also leading the industry by introducing the world’s first 288Hz 8K TV Tcon in\ncollaboration with major TV panel makers. We believe the Tcon segment will be one of the driving forces for our\nnon-driver business moving forward.\nFor CMOS image sensors business, we continue to provide CMOS image sensors for web camera and notebook.\nOur industry-first 2-in-1 CMOS image sensor that supports RGB mode for video conferencing and ultralow power\nAI mode for facial recognition have penetrated the laptop market for the most stylish super slim bezel designs.\nRegarding ultralow power Always-On CMOS image sensor that targets always-on AI applications, we are getting\n69\ngrowing feedback and design adoptions from customers globally for various markets, such as car recorders,\nsurveillance, smart electric meters, drones, smart home appliances, and consumer electronics.\nLastly on LCoS, an area we have committed years of R&D efforts. We continue to focus on AR goggle\ndevices and head-up-displays (HUD) for automotive. Many of our industry-leading customers have demonstrated\ntheir state-of-the-art products with our technology embedded in, including holographic HUD, AR glasses and\nLiDAR system.

Board Practices\nGeneral\nOur board of directors consists of five directors, three of whom are independent directors within the meaning of\nRule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules. We intend to comply with Rule 5605(b)(1) of the Nasdaq Rules that require\nboards of U.S. companies to have a board of directors which is comprised of a majority of independent directors.\nWe intend to follow home country practice that permits our independent directors not to hold regularly scheduled\nmeetings at which only independent directors are present in lieu of complying with Rule 5605(b)(2). None of our\nnon-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service.\n72\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nTo enhance our corporate governance, we have established three committees under the board of directors: the\naudit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. We have\nadopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committee’s members and functions are described below.\nAudit Committee. Our audit committee currently consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng, Hsiung-Ku Chen and Dr.\nYan-Kuin Su.

Our compensation committee assists our board of directors in reviewing and approving\nthe compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers. Our\nchief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting where his or her compensation is deliberated.\nWe intend to follow Rule 5605(d)(1)(B) and (2)(B) of the Nasdaq Rules which requires the compensation committees\nof U.S. companies to be comprised solely of independent directors. The compensation committee will be responsible\nfor, among other things:\n• reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding our compensation policies and\nforms of compensation provided to our directors and officers;\n• reviewing and determining bonuses for our officers and other employees;\n• reviewing and determining share-based compensation for our directors, officers, employees and consultants;\n• administering our equity incentive plans in accordance with the terms thereof; and\n• such other matters that are specifically delegated to the compensation committee by our board of directors\nfrom time to time.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Our current nominating and corporate governance\n73\ncommittee consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng, Hsiung-Ku Chen, and Dr. Yan-Kuin Su.

Our directors\nare subject to periodic retirement and re-election by shareholders in accordance with our articles of association,\nresulting in their retirement and re-election at staggered intervals. At each annual general meeting, one-third of our\ndirectors are subject to retirement by rotation, or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to\none-third but not exceeding one-third shall retire from office. Any retiring director is eligible for re-election. The\nchairman of our board of directors and/or the managing director will not be subject to retirement by rotation or be\ntaken into account in determining the number of directors to retire in each year. Under our articles of association,\nwhich director will retire at each annual general meeting will be determined as follows: (i) any director who\nwishes to retire and not offer himself for re-election, (ii) if no director wishes to retire, the director who has been\nlongest in office since his last re-election or appointment, and (iii) if two or more directors have served on the\nboard the longest, then as agreed among the directors themselves or as determined by lot.\n6.D.

The following description of the plan is intended to be a summary and does not describe\nall provisions of the plan.\nPurpose of the Plan. The purpose of the plan is to advance our interests and those of our shareholders by:\n• providing the opportunity for our employees, directors and service providers to develop a sense of\nproprietorship and personal involvement in our development and financial success and to devote their best\nefforts to our business; and\n• providing us with a means through which we may attract able individuals to become our employees or to\nserve as our directors or service providers and providing us a means whereby those individuals, upon whom\nthe responsibilities of our successful administration and management are of importance, can acquire and\nmaintain share ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for our welfare.\nType of Awards. The plan provides for the grant of stock options and restricted share units.\nDuration. Generally, the plan will terminate five years from the effective date of the plan. But, the amended and\nrestated 2011 Plan was 2nd amended and restated by extending its duration for three (3) years to September 6, 2022,\nwhich was approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting held on August 28, 2019. After the plan is\nterminated, no awards may be granted, but any award previously granted will remain outstanding in accordance with\nthe plan.\nAdministration. The plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors or any other\ncommittee designated by our board to administer the plan. Committee members will be appointed from time to time\nby, and will serve at the discretion of, our board. The committee has full power and authority to interpret the terms\nand intent of the plan or any agreement or document in connection with the plan, determine eligibility for awards\nand adopt such rules, regulations, forms, instruments and guidelines for administering the plan. The committee may\ndelegate its duties or powers.\nNumber of Authorized Shares. We have authorized a maximum issuance of 36,153,854 shares in the 2005 plan\nand 20,000,000 shares in the 2011 plan, and the 2005 plan was terminated in October 2010. As of the date of this\nannual report, there were no stock options or restricted share units outstanding under the plan except as described\nunder “—Stock Options” and “—Restricted Share Units.”\nEligibility and Participation. All of our employees, directors and service providers are eligible to participate in\nthe plan. The committee may select from all eligible individuals those individuals to whom awards will be granted\nand will determine the nature of any and all terms permissible by law and the amount of each award.\nStock Options. The committee may grant options to participants in such number, upon such terms and at any\ntime as it determines. Each option grant will be evidenced by an award document that will specify the exercise\nprice, the maximum duration of the option, the number of shares to which the option pertains, conditions upon\nwhich the option will become vested and exercisable and such other provisions which are not inconsistent with the\nplan.\nThe exercise price for each option will be:\n• based on 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant;\n• set at a premium to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant; or\n• indexed to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, with the committee determining the\nindex.\nThe exercise price on the date of grant must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the shares on\nthe date of grant.\n75\nEach option will expire at such time as the committee determines at the time of its grant; however, no option\nwill be exercisable later than the 10th anniversary of its grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for options\ngranted to participants outside the United States, the committee can set options that have terms greater than ten\nyears.\nOptions will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such terms and conditions as the committee\napproves. A condition of the delivery of shares as to which an option will be exercised will be the payment of\nthe exercise price. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of written\nnotification of exercise and full payment, we will deliver to the participant evidence of book-entry shares or, upon\nhis or her request, share certificates in an appropriate amount based on the number of shares purchased under\nthe option(s). The committee may impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an\noption as it may deem advisable.\nEach participant’s award document will set forth the extent to which he or she will have the right to exercise\nthe options following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 2,226,690 units employee stock options to our certain employees on September 30, 2019\nwith exercise price $2.27 per option. The vesting schedule is, 50% of the options vest half year after the date of\ngrant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant.

The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1, 2020.\nRestricted Share Units. The committee may grant restricted share units to participants. Each grant will be\nevidenced by an award document that will specify the period(s) of restriction, the number of restricted share units\ngranted and such other provisions as the committee determines.\nGenerally, restricted share units will become freely transferable after all conditions and restrictions applicable\nto such shares have been satisfied or lapse and restricted share units will be paid in cash, shares or a combination\nof the two, as determined by the committee.\nThe committee may impose such other conditions or restrictions on any restricted share units as it may deem\nadvisable, including a requirement that participants pay a stipulated purchase price for each restricted share unit,\nrestrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance goals and time-based restrictions on vesting.\nA participant will have no voting rights with respect to any restricted share units.\nEach award document will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to retain restricted\nshare units following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 1,208,785 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2016.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n7.A. Major Shareholders\nOn August 10, 2009, we effected certain changes in our capital stock structure in order to meet the Taiwan\nStock Exchange’s primary listing requirement that the par value of shares be NT$10 or $0.3 per share and in order\nto increase the number of outstanding ordinary shares to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In particular, we\nincreased our authorized share capital from $50,000 (divided into 500,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) to\n$300,000,000 (divided into 3,000,000,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) and distributed 5,999 bonus shares\nfor each share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. These were followed by a\nconsolidation of every 3,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each into one ordinary share of par value $0.3 each. As a\nresult, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was doubled and each of our ordinary shares had a par value of $0.3.\nIn connection with the above changes, we also changed our ADS ratio effective August 10, 2009 from one\nADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing two ordinary shares. Such change in ADS ratio was\nintended to adjust for the net dilutive effect due to the bonus shares distribution and the shares consolidation so that\neach ADS would represent the same percentage ownership in our share capital immediately before and after the\nabove changes. The number of ADSs also remained the same immediately before and after the above changes.\nAs of February 28, 2022, 348,597,140 of our shares were outstanding. We believe that, of such shares,\n213,034,620 shares in the form of ADSs were registered in the name of a nominee of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,\nthe depositary under our ADS deposit agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., advised us that, as of February 28,\n2022, 106,517,310 ADSs, representing 213,034,620 common shares, were held of record by Cede & Co. and 9 other\nregistered shareholders domiciled in and outside of the United States. We have no further information as to common\nshares held, or beneficially owned, by U.S. persons.\nThe following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares as\nof February 28, 2022, the most recent practicable date, by (i) each shareholder known by us to beneficially own more\nthan 5% of our shares and (ii) all directors and executive officers as a group.\nNumber of Shares Percentage of Shares\nName of Beneficial Owner Beneficially Owned(4) Beneficially Owned(4)\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu(1) 74,969,818 21.5%\nWhei-Lan Teng(2) 21,135,720 6.1%\nYiheng Capital Management, L.P.(3) 17,796,244 5.1%\nAll directors and executive officers as a group(4) 83,943,791 24.1%\nNote: (1) Dr. Biing-Seng Wu directly owns 315,322 ordinary shares.

Additionally, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu beneficially owns 194,937 ADSs purchased through\nSanfair Asia Investments Ltd. in the open market according to his share purchase plan announced on\nDecember 3, 2021. Accordingly, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate\nof 74,969,818 ordinary shares, representing approximately 21.5% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(2) Whei-Lan Teng directly owns 1,335,548 ordinary shares. Whei-Lan Teng beneficially owns 2,643,782\nordinary shares through Renmar Finance Limited, which is an investment company controlled by\nWhei-Lan Teng. In addition, Whei-Lan Teng, may be attributed beneficial ownership of 17,156,390\nordinary shares held in trust by Corenmar Investment Limited for the benefit of her children. Whei-Lan\nTeng therefore may be deemed to have shared power to vote or dispose of 21,135,720 ordinary shares.\nAccordingly, Whei-Lan Teng may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 21,135,720 ordinary\nshares, representing approximately 6.1% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(3) According to the Schedule 13G/A filed with the SEC on February 14, 2022, Yiheng Capital Management,\nL.P., together with its affiliates, beneficially owned 17,796,244 of our shares, some or all of which may\ninclude shares represented by our ADS, as of December 31, 2021.

Whether our board of directors\nrecommends any dividends and the form, frequency and amount of dividends, if any, will depend upon our future\noperations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and\nother factors as the board of directors may deem relevant.\nOn June 27, 2008, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $66.8 million, or the equivalent of $0.350 per\nADS. In 2009, we paid a cash dividend on June 29, 2009 in the amount of $55.5 million, or the equivalent of\n$0.300 per ADS, and distributed a stock dividend on August 10, 2009 of 5,999 ordinary shares of par value\n$0.0001 for each ordinary share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. On\nAugust 13, 2010, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $44.1 million, or the equivalent of $0.250 per ADS.\nOn July 20, 2011, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $21.2 million, or the equivalent of $0.120 per\nADS. On July 25, 2012, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $10.7 million, or the equivalent of $0.063 per\nADS. On July 31, 2013, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $42.4 million, or the equivalent of $0.250 per\nADS. On July 23, 2014, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $46.0 million, or the equivalent of $0.270 per\nADS.

On July 31, 2018, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $17.2 million, or the equivalent of\n$0.10 per ADS. On July 12, 2021, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $47.4 million, or the equivalent of\n$0.272 per ADS. For more information on the stock dividend distribution, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders\nand Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” The dividends for any of these years should not be\nconsidered representative of the dividends that would be paid in any future periods or of our dividend policy.\nOur ability to pay cash or stock dividends will depend, at least partially, upon the amount of funds\nreceived by us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, which must comply with the laws and regulations\nof their respective countries and respective articles of association. We receive cash from Himax\nTaiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends in the past. In\naccordance with amended ROC Company Act and regulations and Himax Taiwan’s amended articles of\nincorporation, Himax Taiwan is permitted to distribute dividends after allowances have been made for:\n• payment of taxes;\n• recovery of prior years’ deficits, if any;\n• legal reserve (in an amount equal to 10% of annual profits after having deducted the above items until such\ntime as its legal reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital);\n• special reserve based on relevant laws or regulations, or retained earnings, if necessary; and\n• dividends for preferred shares, if any.\nFurthermore, if Himax Taiwan does not generate any profits for any year as determined in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in Taiwan, it generally may not distribute dividends for that year.\nAny dividend we declare will be paid to the holders of ADSs, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement,\nto the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations,\nless the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Any dividend we declare will be distributed by\nthe depositary bank to the holders of our ADSs. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S.\ndollars.\n8.B.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur shareholders previously adopted the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association on September 26,\n2005 by a special resolution passed by the sole shareholder of our company and the Amended and Restated Articles\nof Association at an extraordinary shareholder meeting held on October 25, 2005, both of which were filed as an\nexhibit to our registration statement on Form F-1 (file no. 333-132372) with the SEC on March 13, 2006.\nAt our annual general meeting on August 6, 2009, our shareholders adopted the Second Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, which became effective on August 10, 2009 and were filed as exhibits to\nour current report on Form 6-K with the SEC on July 13, 2009. These were adopted primarily in connection with\nour proposed Taiwan listing to meet the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s primary listing requirement concerning protection\nof material shareholders’ rights under the ROC’s Company Act and Securities Exchange Act. At the same time, our\nshareholders also adopted the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were\nfiled as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 with the SEC on\nJune 3, 2010 and are substantially the same as the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nof our company except that our authorized share capital is stated to be $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000\nshares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each, on the condition that it shall become effective if the application made\nby our company to list its ordinary shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange is rejected or aborted. On May 20, 2010,\nthe Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association became effective as a result of the\ntermination of our primary listing application to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\nWe incorporate by reference into this annual report the description of our Amended and Restated Memorandum\nand Articles of Association (except for provisions relating to our authorized share capital) contained in our F-1\nregistration statement (File No. 333-132372) filed with the SEC on March 13, 2006. Such description sets forth\na summary of certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association as currently in effect, which is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles\n81\nof Association. As of the date of this annual report, our authorized share capital is $300,000,000 divided into\n1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each.\n10.C. Material Contracts\nWe are not currently, and have not been in the last two years, party to any material contract, other than contracts\nentered into the ordinary course of business.\n10.D. Exchange Controls\nWe have extracted from publicly available documents the information presented in this section. The information\nbelow may be applicable because our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, is incorporated in the\nROC. Please note that citizens of the PRC and entities organized in the PRC are subject to special ROC laws, rules\nand regulations, which are not discussed in this section.\nThe ROC’s Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions must\nbe executed by banks designated to handle foreign exchange transactions by the Central Bank of the ROC. There is\nan annual limit on the amount of currency a Taiwanese entity may convert into, or out of, NT dollars other than for\ntrade purposes. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.\nWith regard to inward and outward remittances (foreign exchange purchased or sold), approval by the Central\nBank of the ROC is generally required for any conversion exceeding, in aggregate in each calendar year, $50\nmillion (and /or its equivalent) for companies and $5 million (and/or its equivalent) for Taiwanese and long term 1\nyear-valid resident permit of foreign individuals. A requirement is also imposed on all private enterprises to report\nall medium- and long-term foreign debt with the Central Bank of the ROC.\nIn addition, a foreign person without an alien resident card or an unrecognized foreign entity may remit to and\nfrom Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $100,000 per remittance if required documentation is provided to the ROC\nauthorities. This limit applies only to remittances involving a conversion between NT dollars and U.S. dollars or\nother foreign currencies.\n10.E. Taxation\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or\nappreciation, and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to\nbe material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable\non instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not\nparty to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman\nIslands.\nWe have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, obtained an\nundertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:\n(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or gains or\nappreciations shall apply to us or our operations;\n(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our\nordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.\nThe undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from May 3, 2005.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders described\nbelow of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive\ndescription of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to hold the securities. This\n82\ndiscussion applies only to a U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. This discussion does not address any aspect of the “Medicare contributions tax” on “net investment\nincome.” In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the U.S.\nHolder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences applicable\nto U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:\n• certain financial institutions;\n• dealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion\ntransaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the ordinary\nshares or ADSs;\n• persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;\n• entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• tax-exempt entities, including “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”;\n• persons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of our voting stock; or\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the\nUnited States.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares or\nADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ordinary shares or ADSs and partners in such partnerships should\nconsult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the\nordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative pronouncements,\njudicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof. These laws\nare subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on representations by the depositary\nand assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed\nin accordance with its terms. You should consult your tax adviser concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a person that is, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ordinary\nshares or ADSs and is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a\ncorporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; or\n(iii) an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the\nunderlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S.\nHolder exchanges ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.\nThe U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released\nbefore delivery of shares to the depositary (“pre-release”) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the\nclaiming of foreign tax credits for U.S. holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be\ninconsistent with the claiming of the preferred rates of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received\nby certain non-corporate U.S. holders. Accordingly, the availability of the preferential tax rates for dividends\nreceived by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, described below, could be affected by actions taken by parties to\nwhom ADSs are pre-released.\nThis discussion assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company (as\ndiscussed below).\nTaxation of Distributions\n83\nDistributions received by U.S. Holders with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs, other than certain pro\nrata distributions of ordinary shares, will constitute foreign-source dividend income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined in accordance\nwith U.S. federal income tax principles. We do not to maintain records of earnings and profits in accordance with\nU.S. federal income tax principles, and therefore it is expected that distributions will generally be reported to U.S.\nHolders as dividends. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s (or\nin the case of ADSs, the depository’s) receipt of the dividends. Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion\nabove regarding concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury, certain dividends paid by qualified foreign corporations\nto certain non-corporate holders may be taxable at preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains.\nA foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on stock that is\nreadily tradable on a securities market in the United States, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where our\nADSs are traded. Our ordinary shares are not traded on a securities market in the United States. Non-corporate U.S.\nHolders of our ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their tax advisers regarding their eligibility for taxation at\nsuch preferential rates and whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at such\npreferential rates. Corporate U.S. Holders will not be entitled to claim the dividends-received deduction with\nrespect to dividends paid by us.\nSale and Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\nA U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes\non the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the\nordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S.\nHolders may be taxable at preferential rates. The amount of gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the\namount realized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs.\nThe deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nWe believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn general, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year\nin which (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents and\nroyalties) or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held\nfor the production of, passive income (including cash). If a corporation owns at least 25% (by value) of the stock\nof another corporation, the corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning its proportionate\nshare of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s\nincome. As PFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets from\ntime to time (and the value of our assets may be determined, in part, based on the market price of our shares\nand ADSs, which may fluctuate considerably from time to time given that market prices of certain technology\ncompanies historically have been volatile), there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable\nyear.\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held ordinary shares or ADSs, certain\nadverse U.S. federal income tax rules would apply on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of ordinary\nshares or ADSs by the U.S. Holder. In general, under those rules, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or\nother disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any\nyear before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable\nyear would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that\ntaxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax attributable to such allocated amounts. Similar\nrules would apply to any distribution in respect of ordinary shares or ADSs to the extent in excess of 125% of the\naverage of the annual distributions on ordinary shares or ADSs received by the U.S. Holder during the preceding\nthree years or the U.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter. Certain elections may be available that\nwould result in alternative treatments (such as a mark-to-market treatment of the ADSs). U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisers to determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the\nconsequences of the alternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances.\nIf we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year, the preferential tax\nrates discussed above with respect to dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders would not apply.\n84\nIn addition, if a U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares or ADSs during any year in which we are a PFIC, the U.S.\nHolder may be required to file certain information reports, containing such information as the U.S. Treasury may\nrequire.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related\nfinancial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding,\nunless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any\nbackup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is\ntimely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\n10.F. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\n10.G. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\n10.H. Documents on Display\nIt is possible to read and copy documents referred to in this annual report that have been filed with the SEC at\nthe SEC’s public reference rooms in Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago, Illinois. Please call the SEC at\n1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the reference rooms.\n10.I. Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates is primarily the interest income\ngenerated by our cash deposited with banks. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks related to bank\nborrowings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. The U.S. dollar is also the functional currency\nfor the majority of our operations. In 2021, more than 99% of our sales and cost of revenues were denominated in U.S.\ndollars. However, in December 2021 approximately 67% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars,\nwith a small percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel new shekel and Chinese Renminbi,\nand the majority of the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. We anticipate that we will continue to conduct\nsubstantially all of our sales in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that we have a material currency risk with regard to\nthe NT dollar. We believe the majority of any potential adverse foreign currency exchange impacts on our operating\nassets may be offset by a potential favorable foreign currency exchange impact on our operating liabilities. From\ntime to time we have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, forward contracts to hedge against our foreign\ncurrency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2021, no foreign currency exchange contracts are outstanding.\nITEM 12.

American Depositary Shares\nFees and Charges Payable by ADS Holders\nPersons depositing or withdrawing\nshares or ADS holders must pay: For:\n$5.00 (or less) per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 Issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting\nADSs) from a distribution of shares or rights or\nother property\nCancellation of ADSs for the purpose of\nwithdrawal, including if the deposit\nagreement terminates\n$.05 (or less) per ADS Any cash distribution to ADS holders\nA fee equivalent to the fee that would be payable if Distribution of securities distributed to holders of\nsecurities distributed to you had been shares and the deposited securities which are distributed by the\nshares had been deposited for the issuance of ADSs depositary to ADS holders\n$.05 (or less) per ADS per calendar year Depositary services\nRegistration or transfer fees Transfer and registration of shares on our share register\nto or from the name of the depositary or its agent when\nyou deposit or withdraw shares\nExpenses of the depositary Cable, telex and facsimile transmissions (when expressly\nprovided in the deposit agreement) converting foreign\ncurrency to U.S. dollars\nTaxes and other governmental charges that the depositary As necessary\nor custodian have to pay on any ADS or share underlying\nan ADS, e.g., stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or\nwithholding taxes\nAny charges incurred by the depositary or its agents for As necessary\nservicing the deposited securities\nThe depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or\nsurrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The depositary collects\nfees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a\nportion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its annual fee for depositary services\nby deduction from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or charging the book-entry system accounts\nof participants acting for them. The depositary may collect any of its fees by deduction from any cash distribution\npayable to ADS holders that are obligated to pay those fees. The depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-\nattracting services until its fees for those services are paid.\nFrom time to time, the depositary may make payments to us to reimburse and/or share revenue from the fees\ncollected from ADS holders, or waive fees and expenses for services provided, generally relating to costs and\nexpenses arising out of establishment and maintenance of the ADS program. In performing its duties under the\ndeposit agreement, the depositary may use brokers, dealers or other service providers that are affiliates of the\ndepositary and that may earn or share fees or commissions.\n86\nFees and Other Payments from the Depositary to Us\nIn 2021, we received $0.6 million netting of 30% withholding tax from the depositary relating to the ADR\nprogram. The payment from the depositary would be intended to cover certain of our expenses incurred in relation\nto the ADR program for the year, including:\n• legal, audit and other fees incurred in connection with preparation of Form 20-F and annual reports and\nongoing SEC compliance and listing requirements;\n• director and officer insurance;\n• stock exchange listing fees;\n• non-deal roadshow expenses;\n• costs incurred by financial printer and share certificate printer;\n• postage for communications to ADR holders;\n• costs of retaining third-party public relations, investor relations and/or corporate communications advisory\nfirms in the U.S.; and\n• costs incurred in connection with participation in retail investor shows and capital markets days.\nAppointment of New Depositary Bank\nOn July 14, 2017, we appointed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as our new American depositary receipt bank.\nEffective the same day, our ADR program was officially transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for a contract\nterm of ten years.\nPART II\nITEM 13.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15(b) of\nthe Exchange Act, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\nIFRS as issued by the IASB.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n87\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions\nand dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our\nfinancial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of our chief executive and chief financial officers, assessed the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of December\n31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, our management believes that\nour internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nAttestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Himax Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and\n2021, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash\nflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the\n“consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated March 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nMarch 23, 2022\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn 2021, no change in our internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the period covered by\nthis annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nITEM 16.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(With Report of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm Thereon)\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Himax Technologies, Inc.\nand subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the related consolidated statements\nof profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the\nthree-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated\nMarch 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures\nto assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer Level Optics cash generating unit\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the balance of property, plant and equipment\nwas $133,236 thousand as of December 31, 2021, a portion of which related to the Wafer Level Optics\ncash generating unit (“CGU”). The Company’s property, plant and equipment is reviewed at the reporting\ndate to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, impairment\nassessment will be performed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its recoverable amount,\nwhich is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The value in use is determined\nby discounting the estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects\ncurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\nWe identified the impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer Level Optics CGU as\na critical audit matter because of the high degree of subjective auditor’s judgment required in evaluating the\nforecasted future revenues and discount rate assumptions and minor changes to those assumptions could have\na significant effect on the Company’s impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer\nLevel Optics CGU. In addition, the evaluation of the discount rate involved specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We\ntested certain internal controls over the Company’s impairment assessment process of property, plant and\nequipment, including controls related to the determination of forecasted future revenues and the assumptions\nused to develop the discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted future revenues by comparing\nthem to the historical revenues of the CGU and industry revenue forecasts. We compared the Company’s\nhistorical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast future\nrevenues. We performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted future revenues and discount rate to assess\ntheir impact on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with\nspecialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s discount rate, by comparing it\nagainst a range of estimated discount rates developed independently based on market data and inputs.\n/s/ KPMG\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nMarch 23, 2022\nF-3\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nPrincipal Activities\nThe Company is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging\nprocessing technologies. The Company is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs\nand timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive,\ndigital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer\nelectronics devices. Additionally, the Company designs and provides controllers for touch\nsensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions,\nLED driver ICs, power management ICs, and LCoS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR)\ndevices and heads-up displays (HUD) for automotive. The Company also offers CMOS image\nsensors, wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D sensing and ultralow power AI image sensing,\nwhich are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC\ncamera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance, AIoT, etc.\n(c) Foreign Currency\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (USD). The functional\ncurrency for the Company and its major operating subsidiaries is the USD. Accordingly,\nthe assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the USD\nare included in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting\ncurrency (the USD) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. Equity\naccounts are translated at historical rates. The statements of profit or loss and cash flows are\ntranslated at the average exchange rates at the date of transaction. Translation gains or losses\nare accumulated as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome.\n(d) Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash,\nsold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are\nobligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year\nfrom the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are\nnoncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash comprise cash balances and demand deposits. Cash equivalents comprise short-term\nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are\nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. Deposits with an original maturity\nof three months or less at the time of purchase but not for investments and other purposes and\nare qualified with the aforementioned criteria are classified as cash equivalent.\nF-17\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(f) Financial Instruments\nThe Company shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of\nfinancial position when, and only when, the Company becomes party to the contractual\nprovisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be\nrecognized and derecognized, as applicable, using trade date accounting.\n1. Financial Assets\n(i) Classification of financial assets\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the\nfinancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets\nare classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, measured\nat fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and measured at\nfair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is\ngenerally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its\ncontractual cash flow characteristics. When, and only when, the Company changes\nits business model for managing financial assets it shall reclassify all affected\nfinancial assets.\ni. Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following\nconditions and is not designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss:\n(i) the asset held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to\ncollect contractual cash flows; and\n(ii) the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced\nby impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and\nimpairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is\nrecognized in profit or loss.\nii. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI)\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the\nCompany may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s\nfair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nF-18\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nEquity investments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends\nare recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents\na recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are\nrecognized in OCI. When an investment is derecognized, the cumulative gain\nor loss in equity will not be reclassified to profit or loss, instead, is reclassified to\nretained earnings.\niii. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss.\nSuch financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, and attributable\ntransaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial\nrecognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in\nprofit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and contract assets.\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable and contract assets are measured at an\namount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost\nand contract assets, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount\nequal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial\ninstrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has\nbeen a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance\nis recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible\ndefault events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and\nsupportable information that is relevant. This includes both qualitative and\nquantitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience\nand credit assessment as well as forward-looking information.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial\ninstruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss\nallowance account.\nF-19\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(iii) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another\nentity.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received\nand receivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an\ninvestment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had\nbeen recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained\nearnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n2. Financial Liabilities\n(i) Classification of financial liability\nThe Company classify all financial liabilities as measured at amortized cost, except\nfor financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities,\nincluding derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.\n(ii) Derecognition of financial liability\nThe Company removes a financial liability from its statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, it is extinguished-when the obligation specified in the contract\nis discharged or cancelled or expires.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to\nanother party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or\nliabilities assumed, shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n(g) Inventories\nInventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods awaiting\nfinal assembly and test and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ndetermined using the weighted-average method. For work-in-process and manufactured\ninventories, cost consists of the cost of raw materials (primarily fabricated wafer and processed\ntape), direct labor and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realizable value\nfor raw materials is based on replacement cost. Net realizable value for finished goods and\nwork in process is calculated based on the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of\ncompletion and necessary selling costs.\nF-20\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(h) Equity Method Investments\nEquity investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over the operating and financial policy decisions of the investee but does not have\na controlling financial interest in the investee, are accounted for using the equity method.\nThe Company’s share of the net income or net loss of an investee is recognized in earnings\nfrom the date the significant influence commences until the date that significant influence\nceases. The difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying\nequity in net assets of an investee at investment date is allocated to related assets which are\namortized over their useful lives. Any unallocated difference is treated as investor-level\ngoodwill and is not amortized.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company\nceases to have significant influence over an associate, and then measures the retained interests\nat fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the\ndate the equity method was discontinued and the fair value of the retained interests along with\nany proceeds from disposing of a part of the interest in the associate is recognized in profit\nor loss. When the Company discontinues the use of the equity method, the Company shall\naccount for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to\nthat investment on the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, if there is any indication of impairment, the entire carrying\namount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment as a single asset, by\ncomparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. An impairment loss recognized\nforms part of the carrying amount of the investment in associates. Accordingly, any reversal of\nthat impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment\nsubsequently increases.\n(i) Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of land, building and machinery and\nequipment used in the design and development of products, and is stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation on building and\nmachinery and equipment commences when the asset is ready for its intended use. Except for\nthe following paragraph, depreciation is primarily calculated on the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of related assets which range as follows: building 25 years, building\nimprovements 4 to 16 years, machinery 4 to 10 years, research and development equipment\n2 to 6 years, office furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years, others 2 to 10 years. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the\nestimated useful life of the asset. Embedded software is amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then\nthey are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nF-21\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nDuring the year 2017, certain new machinery and equipment have been acquired for specific\nproject. The depreciation on these new assets is calculated on Fixed-Percentage-on-Declining-Base\nMethod basis over the estimated useful lives of 3 years. The Company thinks that method\nwould most closely reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits\nembodied in those assets.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\n(j) Leases\na. Identifying a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset, and the supplier does not have a\nsubstantive right to substitute the asset; and\n(ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from\nuse of the identified asset throughout the period of use; and\n(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the\nperiod of use.\nb. As a lessee\nPayments for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases are recognized as expenses\non a straight-line basis during the lease term for which the recognition exemption is\napplied. Except for leases described above, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability shall be\nrecognized for all other leases at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement\ndate. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments,\ndiscounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company determines its\nincremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing\nsources. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial\namount of the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the\ncommencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred\nand an estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring the underlying asset.\nF-22\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term. The lease liability\nis subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured (i) if there is a change in the lease term; (ii) if there is a change in future lease\npayments arising from a change in an index or a rate; (iii) if there is a change in the amounts\nexpected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or (iv) if the Company changes its\nassessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When\nthe lease liability is remeasured in the circumstances aforementioned, a corresponding\nadjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. However, if the\ncarrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the\nremeasurement is recognized in profit or loss.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n(i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments.\n(ii) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise and lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is\nreasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\nMoreover, the lease liability is remeasured when lease modifications occur that decrease\nthe scope of the lease. The Company accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability\nby decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full\ntermination of the lease and recognizes in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the\npartial or full termination of the lease.\nc. As a lessor\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating\nlease are added to the carrying amount of the asset leased.\n(k) Goodwill\nGoodwill is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net\nassets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated\nimpairment losses, if any.\nGoodwill from acquisition of Himax Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly Wisepal Technologies,\nInc., merged into Himax Technologies Limited on July 2, 2018) in 2007 amounting $26,846\nthousand has been assigned to Driver IC cash generating unit (“CGU”) and goodwill from\nacquisition of Himax Display (USA) Inc. in 2012 amounting $1,292 thousand has been\nassigned to WLO CGU because these CGUs are expected to benefit from the synergies of the\nbusiness combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. For the purpose of\nF-23\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU\nthat are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount\nof a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets\nof the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment\nloss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for\ngoodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In\nassessing value in use which was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial\nbudgets covering the future five-year period with the terminal growth rate. The annual\ndiscount rate was 18.28% and 8.05% in its test of Goodwill impairment for Driver IC CGU\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, based on industry weighted average cost of\ncapital. The annual discount rate for WLO CGU was 15.41% and 13.33% as of December 31,\n2020 and 2021, respectively. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average\nTaiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.32% and 2.46%\nused in the test for both CGUs as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The key\nassumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the related\nindustry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\n(l) Other Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets include patents, intellectual property and developed technology\nacquired in a business combination. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over the following estimated useful lives: software 2-10 years, patents 12-15 years,\nintellectual property 10 years and technology 7 years.\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\n(m) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company’s long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and\nequipment and intangible assets, are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there\nis any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable\namount is estimated.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Considering the\nterminal growth rate if non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life are allocated to the\nCGU in comparison with its carrying amount.\nF-24\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are\nlargely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating\nunit, or CGU”).\nThe annual discount rate was 13.23% and 11.40% in its test of non-financial assets impairment\nwith an indefinite useful life for CMOS CGU as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively,\nbased on industry weighted average cost of capital. The terminal growth rate, based on\nfollowing 5 years average Taiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary\nFund, was 2.32% and 2.46% used in the test as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nThe key assumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for\nthe related industry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. When an\nimpairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU is increased\nto the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not\nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nIFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with\ncustomers, using a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount of\nrevenue recognized. The Company generates revenue primarily from sale of goods or services.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by primarily geographical market and\nmajor products.\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company identifies the contract with the customers and recognizes revenue\nwhen performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled\nin the transfer of goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when\nit satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a\ncustomer. Customers obtain control of the product when the goods are delivered and accepted\nby customers. Invoices are generated at that point in time.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition from product sales is measured at the amount that is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will\nnot occur. Revenue is reduced for estimated rebates and other similar allowances.\nTrade receivable is recognized when the Company is entitled for unconditional right to\nreceive payment upon delivery of goods to customers. The consideration received in advance\nfrom the customer but without delivery of goods is recognized as a contract liability, for\nwhich revenue is recognized when the control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\nF-25\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nThe Company expects that the length of time when the Company transfers the goods or\nservices to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be less\nthan one year. Therefore, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the time value of\nmoney.\n(o) Employee Benefits\n1. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed unless another policy allows or requires it to be\ncapitalized. Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured\nat the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service\nrendered by employees.\n2. Share-based payment arrangements\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for share-based compensation is\nmeasured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments issued. The\ncost of employee services is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to employees\nand is recognized in earnings with a corresponding increase in equity over the service\nperiod by graded vesting. Compensation cost also considers the number of awards\nmanagement believes will eventually vest. As a result, compensation cost is reduced by the\nestimated forfeitures. The estimate is adjusted each period to reflect the current estimate of\nforfeitures, and finally, the actual number of awards that vest.\n3. Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nemployee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered\nby employees.\n4. Defined benefit plans\nThe Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated\nseparately for each benefit plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting\nthe fair value of any plan assets. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost\nof providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit\ncosts (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit\nretirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service\ncost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability\n(asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in profit or loss in the period they\noccur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan\nassets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected\nimmediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\nF-26\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(p) Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in profit or loss\nexcept to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in\nequity or in other comprehensive income.\n1. Current tax\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or\nlosses for the year and any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous\nyears. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted tax rate at the\nreporting date.\n2. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial\nstatements and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply\nto taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax\nrates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax\nassets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the\nprobability of future taxable profits improves.\n(q) Business Combinations\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-\nrelated costs are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as\nthe excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling\ninterests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in\nthe acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and\nthe liabilities assumed. Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling\ninterests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\nAny contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the\ncontingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is\naccounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration are recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and the resulting gain\nor loss is recognized in profit or loss.\nF-27\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n(r) Earnings Per Ordinary Share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is computed using profit or loss attributable to the\nshareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of\nordinary and diluted ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary\nequivalent shares are ordinary shares that are contingently issuable upon the vesting of\nunvested restricted share units (RSUs) and employee stock options granted to employees.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nProfits (loss) attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders (in thousands) $ (13,614) 47,134 436,896\nDenominator for basic earnings per ordinary share:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\n(in thousands) 345,101 345,708 349,228\nBasic earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders $ (0.04) 0.14 1.25\nBasic earnings (loss) per ADS attributable to\nHimax Technologies,Inc. stockholders(2) $ (0.08) 0.27 2.50\nContingently issuable ordinary shares underlying the unvested RSUs and employee stock\noptions granted to employees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary\nshare based on treasury stock method.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nProfits (loss) attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders (in thousands) $ (13,614) 47,134 436,896\nDenominator for diluted earnings per ordinary share:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares\noutstanding (in thousands) 345,101 345,708 349,228\nUnvested RSUs (in thousands)(1) - - 505\nEmployee stock options (in thousands)(1) - 1,058 -\n345,101 346,766 349,733\nF-28\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The number of ADS equivalent outstanding is\ndetermined by dividing the number of ordinary shares by two. Therefore, the weighted\naverage number of ADS equivalent outstanding used in basic earnings per ADS for 2019,\n2020 and 2021 is 172,550 thousand, 172,854 thousand and 174,614 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the weighted average number of ADS equivalent outstanding used in diluted\nearnings per ADS for 2019, 2020 and 2021 is 172,550 thousand, 173,383 thousand and\n174,867 thousand, respectively. The earnings (loss) per ADS is presented solely for the\nconvenience of the reader and does not represent a measure under IFRS.\n(s) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses. All operating segments’ operating results\nare reviewed regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for\nwhich discrete financial information is available.\nThe Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who regularly\nreviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing\nperformance for the Company. Management has determined that the Company has two\noperating segments: Driver IC and Non-driver products.\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on segment sales and\nsegment profit and loss. There are no intersegment sales in the segment revenues reported to\nthe CODM. Segment profit and loss is determined on a basis that is consistent with how the\nCompany reports operating income (loss) in its consolidated statements of operations. Segment\nprofit (loss) excludes income taxes and items in non-operating income (loss).\nF-29\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nThe Company does not report segment asset information to the Company’s CODM.\nConsequently, no asset information by segment is presented.\n(t) Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are classified in the consolidated statements of profit or loss as part\nof profit (loss) for the period and the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part\nof equity in the consolidated statements of financial position. If a change in ownership of a\nconsolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership\ninterests are re-measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings.\n(u) Use of Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any\nfuture periods affected.\nInformation about critical judgments, estimates and assumptions in applying accounting\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements is included in the following notes:\n1. Valuation of inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses\njudgment and estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each\nreporting period.\nDue to the rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value of\ninventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then\nwrites down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific\ntime horizon.\n2. Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of non-financial assets other than\ngoodwill, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\nindependent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to\nthe specific asset groups. Any changes in these estimates based on changed economic\nconditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal\nin future years.\nF-30\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\n3. Recognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits\nwill be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of\nthe realization of the deferred tax assets requires the Company’s subjective judgment and\nestimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, the sources of taxable\nincome, the amount of tax credits that can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies.\nChanges in the economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and\nregulations may result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n4. Impairment of goodwill\nThe assessment of impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make subjective\njudgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and\nestimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating the\nrecoverable amount of relevant CGU, the Company is required to make subjective\njudgments in determining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent\ncash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nNote 5. Acquisition\n(a) Acquisition of nano 3D mastering related business\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company, through Himax IGI Precision Ltd., completed the\nacquisition of nano 3D mastering related business with total cash consideration approximating\n$1,400 thousand, and half of which, $700 thousand, was paid in 2019.\nThe advanced nano 3D manufacturing masters are primarily used in imprinting or stamping\nreplication process to fabricate devices such as diffractive optical element (DOE), diffuser,\ncollimator lens and micro lens array. The acquisition brings the Company the very upstream\nmaster tooling capability to supplement its world leading wafer level optics (WLO) technology,\nwhich is critical in its efforts to offer 3D sensing total solutions.\nAcquired assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values. Property, plant and\nequipment, other intangible asset and prepaid maintenance acquired were $700 thousand, $400\nthousand and $300 thousand, respectively.\nF-31\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

On June 28, 2018, the\nCompany completed the acquisition of all the outstanding common shares of Emza with total\ncash consideration approximating $6,371 thousand, including $400 thousand holdback was\npaid in 2019. The Company’s previously held equity interests in Emza was re-measured at\nfair value, which was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser using the\nequity value allocation method at acquisition date. The re-measurement gain on the previously\nheld equity interests in Emza was $1,662 thousand which is included in “other income” in the\nconsolidated statements of profit or loss.\nEmza is an Israeli company dedicated to the development of visual sensors that include\nproprietary machine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that enable always-on visual\nsensing capabilities, achieving improvement in power consumption, price and form factor.\nThis acquisition would allow the Company to fully leverage the synergy into producing visual\nsensors that integrate camera, hardware and algorithms and operate at unprecedented power,\ncost and size.\nThe results of Emza’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements since that date. The amounts of Emza’s revenues and losses included\nin the consolidated statements of profit or loss from the acquisition date to the period ended\nDecember 31, 2018 were $72 thousand and $2,858 thousand, respectively.

The valuation\nof acquired intangible assets consisting of the core and developed technology $6,282\nthousand and trademark $1,800 thousand were determined based on management’s estimates\nand consultation with an independent appraiser. The multi-period excess earnings method\nwas used in applying the income approach to determine the fair value of acquired intangible\nassets. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation method for acquired intangible\nassets are employed and included, but are not limited to, prospective financial information,\nterminal value, and discount rates. When performing the multi-period excess earnings\nmethod for acquired intangible assets, the Company incorporates the use of projected\nfinancial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant\nbased assumptions. The cash-flow projections are based on seven-year financial forecasts\ndeveloped by management that include revenue projections, capital spending trends, and\ninvestment in working capital to support anticipated revenue growth, which are regularly\nreviewed by management. The selected discount rate considers the risk and nature of the\ncomparative companies and the rates of return market participants would require to investing\ntheir capital in reporting units.\nThe acquired intangible assets, the core and developed technology, will be amortized based on\na weighted-average useful life of approximately 7 years. However, the acquired trademark is\nintangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\n(c) Acquisition of CM Visual Technology Corp.\nOn October 30, 2020, the Company infused cash of $6,680 thousand into CMVT in exchange\nfor 66.71% of the outstanding common shares of CMVT.

Sensitivity analysis\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises from the translation of the foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,\nother receivable, accounts payable, other payable and lease liabilities that are denominated\nin foreign currency.\nDepreciation or appreciation of the USD by 10% against the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD),\nCNY and JPY at December 31, 2020 and 2021, while all other variables were remained\nconstant, would have increased or (decreased) the net profit before tax of $3,330 thousand\nand $11,548 thousand, respectively.\niii. Interest rate risk\nThe Company’s short-term secured borrowings and long-term unsecured borrowings\ncarried floating interest rates and fixed interest rates. The Company’s exposure to changes\nin interest rates is mainly from floating-rate borrowings. Any change in interest rates will\ncause the effective interest rates of borrowings to change and thus cause the future cash\nflows to fluctuate over time.\nThe following sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to interest rate risk.\nFor floating-rate debts, the analysis assumes that the balances of outstanding debts at the\nend of the reporting period had been outstanding for the entire year.\nFor the Company’s floating-rate debts, assuming all other variables were remained\nconstant, an increase or a decrease in the interest rate by 0.25% would have resulted in a\ndecrease or an increase in the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31, 2020\nand 2021 by $146 thousand and $131 thousand, respectively.\nF-69\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Financial Risk Management\n(a) Overview\nThe Company is exposed to the following risks due to usage of financial instruments:\n(1) Credit risk\n(2) Liquidity risk\n(3) Market risk\nHereinafter discloses information about the Company’s exposure to variable risks, and the\ngoals, policies and procedures of the Company’s risk measurement and risk management.\n(b) Risk management framework\nManagement of related divisions are appointed to review, control, trace and monitor the\nstrategic risks, financial risks and operational risks faced by the Company. Management\nreports to executive officers the progress of risk controls from time to time and, if necessary,\nreport to the board of directors, depending on the extent of impact of risks.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a\nfinancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposures to\ncredit risk are primarily from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost\nand accounts receivable.\nThe Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with various reputable financial\ninstitutions. Financial assets at amortized cost are time deposits with original maturities\nof greater than three months. The Company has not experienced any material losses on\ndeposits of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at amortized cost.\nManagement performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial\ninstitutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Management\nbelieves that there is a limited concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalent and\nfinancial assets at amortized cost.\nF-72\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nThe Company derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of display drivers that are\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions and subject to price fluctuations. Management\ncontinuously evaluates and controls the credit quality, credit limit and financial strength of its\ncustomers to ensure any overdue receivables are taken necessary procedures.\nThe Company depends on two customers for majority of its revenues. The Company’s sales\nto these two customers as a percentage of revenues are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2020 2021\nCustomer A and its affiliates 29.5% 32.6% 32.1%\nCustomer C 5.6% 12.7% 19.1%\nThe percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable accounted by customers, those\nrepresenting more than 10% of total accounts receivable balance, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2020 2021\nCustomer A and its affiliates 36.3% 39.0%\nCustomer C 13.6% 12.1%\nRefer to Note 11 for aging analysis of accounts receivable and the movement in the loss\nallowance.\nIn addition, the Company has at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of\nits customers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment terms, and the\nCompany may grant such requests for extension in the future. As a result, a default by any\nsuch customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable, or the extension of\npayment terms for the Company’s customers could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow,\nliquidity and operating results. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of each\ncustomer and adjusts credit policy based upon payment history and the customer’s credit\nworthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity\nto fund its business requirements associated with existing operations over the next 12\nmonths. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate working capital\nand unused credit facilities.\nF-73\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company’s working capital together with existing unused credit\nfacilities under its existing loan agreements will be sufficient to fulfill all of its contractual\nobligations. Therefore, management believes that there is no liquidity risk resulting from\nincapable of financing to fulfill the contractual obligations.\n(e) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and\ninterest rates, will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial\ninstruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n(1) Currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on operating activities that are denominated\nin a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Company, the USD.\nThe currencies used in these transactions are the NTD, CNY and JPY.\n(2) Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its outstanding\nborrowings. The Company’s borrowings carried floating interest rates. To manage the\ninterest rate risk, the Company periodically assesses the interest rates of bank loans\nand maintains good relationships with financial institutions to obtain lower financing\ncosts. The Company also strengthens the management of working capital to reduce the\ndependence on bank loans as well as the risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\nNote 25. Capital management\nThrough clear understanding and managing of significant changes in external environment, related\nindustry characteristics, and corporate growth plan, the Company manages its capital structure\nin a manner to ensure it has sufficient financial resources to fund its working capital needs,\ncapital expenditures, research and development activities, dividend payments and other business\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.

          "content": "2020 Annual Report\nDear Shareholders,\nLooking back at 2020, it was a volatile year. The global economy and semiconductor industry were severely\ndamaged by the outbreak of COVID-19 and overshadowed by the prolonged US-China trade tension. The\nmarket for electronics devices saw a strong turnaround in demand during the second half of 2020 fueled\nby new work-from-home and e-learning lifestyles. However, the demand surge also intensified the ongoing\ncapacity shortage in foundry, assembly and testing. Under these challenging conditions, Himax thrived,\ndelivering strong business results with a much-improved product mix from our comprehensive product\nportfolio, diversified customer base and long-term partnerships with suppliers.\nIt was a fruitful year for Himax in 2020. We increased our market share and achieved record revenue and\ngross margin in the fourth quarter while maintaining our leadership positions in tablet and automotive. We\nalso made significant progress in our promising ultralow power smart sensing solutions. For the longer term,\nwe remain committed to investing across all our product segments to further solidify our leading position in\nthe global marketplace. As we move forward, we are dedicated to high quality, strict reliability, and efficient\nexecution to deliver shareholder value.\nNow let me review each of our major business segments in 2020.\nStarting with our driver business, despite the capacity shortage the overall display driver IC businesses\ndemonstrated robust growth. Led by TDDI for tablet and smartphone, our small and medium-sized driver IC\nsegment dominated this year’s strong growth.\nFor our large display driver IC business, the prevailing work-from-home and distance education gave rise to\nstrong growth in monitor and notebook businesses in 2020. However, TV sales declined due to weakness in\nthe global TV market. As market dynamics embrace higher frame rate and higher resolution technologies,\nHimax has become a preferred integrated solution supplier providing extensive display driver and high-end\nTcon solution to customers. This has resulted in our successful penetration into 4K/8K TV, gaming monitor\nand low power consumption notebook markets.\nFor our small and medium-sized driver IC business, the tablet segment was the top sales contributor, posting\nthe highest growth of all product lines in 2020. The substantial growth reflected robust customer demand\nand rapid TDDI penetration, as well as our leading position in the Android tablet market. Himax pioneered\nthe tablet TDDI technology and led mass production starting from the first quarter of 2020. Our tablet TDDI\noffers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish design as well as improved touch accuracy with an active\nstylus specifically geared for high quality writing and drawing. We are the dominant supplier of tablet TDDI\nfor literally all leading Android names. In the smartphone market, we succeeded in regaining market share\nwith our comprehensive product portfolio and capacity support.\nTurning to automotive segment. Global car sales were badly hit by the pandemic in first half of 2020 but\nbegan to recover during Q3 2020 with sales for our automotive drivers showing decent growth in the fourth\nquarter. Himax, as a leader in the automotive driver IC market, foresees additional market share gains as the\nautomotive market embraces new display technologies and shifts towards larger, more sophisticated, higher\nperforming displays as well as more displays inside each car. We sustained our competitive position with a\ncomprehensive product offering for advanced new features such as in-cell touch, local dimming, cascade-\ntopology connection and P2P high-speed interface bridging function. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the\nunfolding display application demand, we have secured a meaningful capacity increase in automotive to\nsupport the long-term growth.\nOur non-driver IC segment progressed nicely in 2020. While WLO revenue decreased as shipment for legacy\nmodels to an anchor customer declined, we continued to work with key customers and partners for their next\ngeneration products with our leading nanoimprinting technologies and diffraction optics design. Looking at\n3D sensing for smartphone, we offer our leading ToF optical components and team up with leading VCSEL\nsuppliers, ToF sensor vendors, module makers and smartphone OEMs to develop a new world-facing 3D\nsensing camera targeting next generation Android smartphones. For non-smartphone 3D sensing, our structured\n1\nlight-based 3D decoder ASIC was certified by the leading Chinese electronic payment standard. A decent\norder pipeline and new design-in sockets are expected in 2021.\nIn the ultralow power smart sensing, we made encouraging progress in both total solution and key component\nbusiness models. For total solution that integrates Himax AoS sensor, ultralow power AI processor and\ncomputer-vision AI algorithm from our subsidiary EMZA or third-party algorithm partners, we are currently\naiming at numerous applications, notably TV, notebook, air conditioner, automotive, utilities meter and\nAIoT applications, just to name a few. We expect a solid production ramp-up by the end of 2021. For key\ncomponents, we partnered with world-leading AI and cloud service ecosystem providers, such as Google and\nMicrosoft, to leverage their leading-edge AI frameworks. Following the successful adoption of our WE-I Plus\nAI processor in the Google TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers framework, our WE-I Plus AIoT platform\nwas endorsed by Microsoft and was awarded the Azure IoT PnP certificate. We also promoted our key\ncomponents with various partners including SparkFun, an online retail store, and Edge Impulse, a leading\nend-to-end AI developer platform provider, to build an extended and easily deployed network for emerging\nedge AI and AIoT markets that require ultralow power. We are excited about our progress and believe our\nsmart sensing offerings will become a major contributor to our business growth soon.\nAs we look forward, semiconductor foundry supply is not likely to see a significant increase soon with strong\ndemand persisting and the capacity shortage becoming even more severe. By managing our foundry capacity\nfor optimal allocation based on products where Himax is a market leader or has strong customer support, we\nare well positioned to meet this challenge and continue to deliver strong results.\nI am grateful for the support of our shareholders, customers, partners, and employees, and look forward with\nconfidence to having a great year in 2021.\nSincerely,\nJordan Wu\nPresident and CEO\nHimax Technologies, Inc.\n2\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 20-F\n(Mark One)\nREGISTRATION STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(b) OR (g) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nOR\nx ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020\nOR\nTRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from ________________ to ________________\nOR\nSHELL COMPANY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nDate of event requiring this shell company report ________________\nCommission file number: 000-51847\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)\nNot Applicable\n(Translation of Registrant’s name into English)\nCAYMAN ISLANDS\n(Jurisdiction of incorporation or organization)\nNO. 26, ZIH LIAN ROAD\nSINSHIH DISTRICT, TAINAN CITY 74148\nTAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n(Address of principal executive offices)\nJessica Pan\nChief Financial Officer\nTelephone: +886-6-505-0880\nE-mail: jessica_pan@himax.com.tw\nFacsimile: +886-6-507-0038\nNo. 15, Zih Lian Road\nSinshih District, Tainan City 74148\nTaiwan, Republic of China\n(Name, Telephone, E-mail and/or Facsimile number and Address of Company Contact Person)\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act:\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol Name of each exchange on which registered\nOrdinary Shares, par value $0.3 per HIMX The NASDAQ Global Select\nordinary share Market Inc.*\n* Not for trading, but only in connection with the listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, Inc. of American Depositary Shares\nrepresenting such Ordinary Shares.\n3\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act: None\nSecurities for which there is a reporting obligation pursuant to\nSection 15(d) of the Act: None\nIndicate the number of outstanding shares of each of the issuer’s classes of capital or common stock as of the\nclose of the period covered by the annual report. 347,534,102 Ordinary Shares.\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the\nSecurities Act. x Yes No\nIf this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file\nreports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Reason for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n3.D. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation, which could\nresult in an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.\nThere may be industry consolidation among our suppliers. Merger and acquisition activities will likely increase\nthe size and market power of the relevant suppliers and reduce the number of suppliers we could use under a simpler\nsupplier chain. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer contract terms,\nhigher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could result in an increase\nin our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. If we are unable to transfer any increase in average unit cost to our\ncustomers, our gross margin and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical\nand subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business\nor results of operations.\nIn 2019 and 2020, 81.1% and 85.2% of our revenues, respectively, were attributable to display drivers that\nwere incorporated into TFT-LCD panels. We expect to continue to substantially depend on sales to the TFT-\nLCD panel industry for the foreseeable future. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive and is\nvulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD panels generally decline\nwith time as a result of, among other factors, end product that incorporating TFT LCD panel demand drop,\nnew capacity ramp-up or factory utilization improvement, technological advancements and cost reduction with the\nexception of the new high end and high-resolution products.\n12\nThe merger of certain of our major customers could result in an increase in their bargaining power and therefore\nsubject us to additional downward pricing pressure. We cannot assure you that in such periods in which we\nexperience significant downward pricing pressure, we could sufficiently reduce costs to completely offset the loss of\nrevenues. In addition, a severe and prolonged industry downturn could also result in higher risks to the collectability\nof our accounts receivable, the marketability and valuation of inventories, the impairment of our long-term non-\nfinancial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and the stability of our supply\nchain. As a result, the cyclicality of the TFT-LCD panel industry could adversely affect our revenues, cost of\nrevenues and results of operations.\nOur strategy of expanding our product offerings to non-driver products may not be successful.\nWe have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, financial and management resources to non-driver products’\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing to further diversify our product portfolio and improve gross margin\nas non-driver products may have higher gross margin than our driver products. Our non-driver technologies cover\nLCOS microdisplay, Always-on-Sensor (“AoS”) CMOS image sensor, wafer level optics (“WLO”), 3D sensing and\nultralow power smart sensing, etc.\nFor our LCOS technology, at present our main focus areas for LCOS business are AR goggle devices and head-\nup-displays (HUD) for automotive. AoS CMOS image sensor is a specific sensor which consumes only several\nmicro watts to perform people detection, eye ball tracking, and other features. The new sensor architectures,\nreadout, pixel, and the corresponding slim algorithms are integrated together to contribute the always-on feature.\nFor smartphone 3D sensing, we aggressively work with our partners from VCSEL, sensor, module and OEM fields,\njointly participate in major ongoing Android smartphone projects covering time-of-flight (ToF) for world-facing\ncamera. On non-smartphone 3D-sensing, with our Structured Light 3D SLiM solution and 3D decoder ASIC key\ncomponent, we aim at emerging market such as smart door lock, facial recognition-based e-payment, business access\ncontrol and biomedical inspection device markets. For our ultralow power smart sensing solution, we focus on\nproviding leading edge AI solutions both total solution and discrete key component to meet diversified customer and\napplication needs. For smart sensing total solution, which integrated with our AoS sensor, WE-I edge AI processor\nand AI-based algorithm from Emza, Himax’s subsidiary, or other algorithm partners in ultralow power performance,\nwhere the target market is currently on notebook, TV, air conditioner, home appliance, etc. To further broaden market\nreach, we also joint AI ecosystem and team up with partners to provide the state-of-the-art, low entry barrier edge AI\ndevelopment framework and tools to developers.\nDeveloping and commercializing each of our non-driver products requires a significant amount of management,\nengineering and monetary resources. For example, we have established certain in-house facilities for key\nmanufacturing processes of our non-driver products including LCOS microdisplay, WLO and 3D sensing. Numerous\nuncertainties exist in developing new products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our non-\ndriver products successfully. We may underestimate the amount of capital, personnel and other resources required\nto develop and commercialize our non-driver products. We may also overestimate the market potential of the end\nproducts that are utilizing or will utilize our non-driver products. The failure or delay in the development, production\nor commercialization of any of our non-driver products, the occurrence of any product defects or design flaws, or the\nlow market acceptance of or demand for either of our products or the end devices using our products may adversely\naffect the impairment of our long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment and\nintangible assets, for non-driver products, our results of operations and growth prospects. The lower capacity\nutilization rate of our factories will negatively affect our gross margin and our results of operations. Moreover, we\nwill be subject to higher ramp-up expenses in the early stage of mass production of our non-driver products.\nThe concentration of our revenues and accounts receivable and the extension of payment terms for certain\nof our customers exposes us to increased credit risk and could harm our operating results and cash flows.\nIn 2020, Customer A and its affiliates accounted for 32.6% of our revenues. Our three largest customers\ntogether accounted for over 50% of our revenues in 2020. See “Item 5.A. Operating Results—Description of\nCertain Statement of Profit or Loss Line Items—Revenues” for our revenues description. Our results of operations\nand financial condition would be significantly linked to the success and purchase policy of any such customer.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our accounts receivable from Customer A and its affiliates were $88.4 million, which\nrepresented approximately 36.3% of our accounts receivable, net. The concentration of our accounts receivable\nexposes us to increased credit risk. Moreover, we have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of our\ncustomers. As a result, any loss of or a sharp reduction in any such customer’s sales, a default by any such customer,\na prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable or the extension of payment terms for our customers could\n13\nadversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results\nOur customers may experience a decline in profitability or may not be profitable at all, which could\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTFT-LCD panel manufacturers, including our customers, experience significant pressure on prices and profit\nmargins, due largely to growing industry capacity and fluctuations in demand for TFT-LCD panels. Some panel\nmanufacturers have greater access to capital or greater production, research and development, intellectual property,\nmarketing or other resources than our customers, who may not be able to compete and sustain their market positions.\nBesides, our customers’ business performance may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which\nare beyond their control, including and not limited to: (1) consumer demand and the general economic conditions; (2)\nthe cyclical nature of TFT-LCD industry in average selling price fluctuations, as well as its downstream industries;\n(3) the speed at which TFT-LCD panel manufacturers expand production capacity; (4) brand companies’ continued\nneeds for original equipment manufacturing services provided by TFT-LCD panel manufacturers; (5) access to raw\nmaterials, components, equipment and utilities on a timely and economical basis; (6) technological changes; (7) the\nrescheduling and cancellation of large orders; (8) access to funding on satisfactory terms; and (9) fluctuations in the\ncurrencies of TFT-LCD panels exporting countries against the U.S. dollar.\nWe depend on sales of display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, and the limited potential for further\ngrowth in both the market size of display drivers and the market share of our display drivers or the absence\nof continued market acceptance of our display drivers could limit our growth in revenues or harm our\nbusiness.\nIn 2019 and 2020, 81.1% and 85.2% of our revenues, respectively, from the sale of display drivers used for large,\nsmall and medium-sized applications, and we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from\nthese or related products. As the display driver industry is relatively mature, there may be limited potential for the\noverall display drivers market to grow and for us to further grow our market share and revenues.\nFailure to grow our unit shipments for display drivers, coupled with a general decline in the average selling\nprices, could adversely and materially affect our results of operations. See also “—Risks Relating to Our Industry—\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our revenues and\noperating results”. Therefore, the continued market acceptance of our display drivers is critical to our future success.\nFailure to grow or maintain our revenues generated from the sales of display drivers could adversely and materially\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to public health epidemics, including the recent novel coronavirus outbreaks.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a public health epidemic interferes\nwith our ability, or that of our employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners to perform our and their\nrespective responsibilities and obligations related to the conduct of our business. Since November 2019, a novel\nstrain of coronavirus (Covid-19) has spread across the world. To date, the Covid-19 outbreak has caused significant\ndisruption to the financial markets and international supply chains, which can substantially depress global business\nactivities, restrict access to capital and result in a long-term economic downturn that would negatively affect our\noperating results.\nAs a result of the pandemic, numerous unprecedented measures are in place to try to contain the virus, such as\ntravel restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home and social distancing orders, and shutdowns. These measures may\nfurther impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and suppliers. The ultimate impact\nand efficacy of measures and potential future measures is currently unknown. We have experienced and will\nexperience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other restrictions on\nthe ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to develop and design our products\nin a timely manner. Our suppliers, sub-contractors and customers have been and will be disrupted by quarantines\nand social distancing measures, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure,\nborder closures, or other travel-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our suppliers’\nmanufacturing, assembling, and testing operations, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments will be\ndelayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations and customer relationships.\nDespite these dramatic headwinds, in year 2020, due to pandemic lockdown, the work-from-home and learn-\nfrom-home new lifestyles triggered increasing display and related display drivers demands. Our business rebounded\n14\nstrongly throughout the second half of 2020 with fresh demands brought by the new stay-at-home economy. Gross\nmargin in 2020 was 24.9%, up from 20.5% in 2019. The year-over-year improvement was mainly due to strong\nsales in the second half and a more favorable product mix. The increase of gross margin in 2020 also reflected\nstrong overall demands and better product pricing on rising material costs across foundry, assembly and testing, all\nundergoing severe capacity shortage. Not meeting all demands, we were able to allocate the limited capacity to the\nproducts with better margins. However, with a growing number of vaccinations or after the pandemic is over, the\nsurge demand, the better pricing, the more favorable product mix as well as the better gross margin we enjoy right\nnow may fade away or decreased progressively and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations\nand financial condition.\nExtra export license may be needed for certain product or technology for certain customers. These licenses\nare regulated by Export Administration Regulations (EAR) which is administered by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\nOur business is subject to various international laws and legal requirements from the U.S. Export Administration\nRegulations and other’s applicable executive orders in packaging, product content, labor and import/export\nregulations, etc. These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and with limited notice,\nhave generally become more rigorous and have intensified under the current U.S. administration, especially in\nrecent geopolitical tensions with China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to\nremedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations or our\ncustomers are sanctioned, or added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may be required to suspend sales to these\ncustomers, which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely impact our results of operations. If our\nfoundry, tape, assembly and testing suppliers fail to comply with these regulations or our suppliers are sanctioned\nor added to the Entity List of EAR by BIS, we may suspend their services and have to obtain alternative services in\na timely manner. Considering the amount of time, it usually takes to qualify assembly and testing houses, we may\nexperience significant delays in product shipments. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality\nor cost of our products could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the\nscarcity and importance of services may necessitate us making investments in foundry, tape, assembly and testing\nservice providers in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and\npossibly raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nTechnological innovation may reduce the number of display drivers typically required for each panel, thereby\nreducing the number of display drivers we are able to sell per panel. If such a reduction in demand is not\noffset by the general growth of the industry, our market share or average selling prices, or our revenues may\ndecline.\nIn order to reduce costs, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers generally seek to have display drivers with higher\nchannel counts and new panel designs to reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel. We have been\ndeveloping such innovative and cost-effective display driver solutions in order to grow our market share, attract\nadditional customers, increase our average selling prices and capture new design wins. However, we cannot assure\nyou that we will successfully achieve these goals. If we fail to do so and the number of display drivers typically\nrequired per panel decreases thereby reducing our unit shipments, our revenues may decline. TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers have developed several panel designs to reduce the usage of display drivers, including gate in panel,\nor GIP, amorphous silicon gate, or ASG, or simply gateless designs, which integrate the gate driver function onto the\nglass and eliminate the need for gate drivers, as well as dual gate and triple gate panel designs, which would largely\nreduce the usage of source drivers. If such designs or technologies become widely adopted, demand for our display\ndrivers may decrease significantly, which would adversely and materially affect our results of operations.\nThe strategic relationships between certain of our competitors and their customers and the development of\nin-house capabilities by TFT-LCD and AMOLED panel manufacturers may limit our ability to expand our\ncustomer base and our growth prospects.\nCertain of our competitors have established or may establish strategic or strong relationships with TFT-LCD\npanel manufacturers that are also our existing or potential customers. Marketing our display drivers to such TFT-\nLCD panel manufacturers that have established relationships with our competitors may be difficult. Moreover,\nseveral TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have in-house design capabilities and therefore may not need to source\nsemiconductor products from us. If our customers successfully develop in-house capabilities to design and develop\nsemiconductors that can substitute for our products, they would likely reduce or stop purchasing our products. To\nsell new products, we will likely need to target new market segments and new customers with whom we do not\n15\nhave current relationships with, which may require different strategies and may present difficulties that we have not\nencountered before. Failure to broaden our customer base and attract new customers may limit our growth prospects.\nAs AMOLED offer brighter color, near-perfect-black, less power consumption and thinner and lighter than\nTFT-LCD, it gradually penetrates mid to high-end TFT-LCD market, especially the smartphone market. AMOLED\ndisplay and related DDICs have been dominated by Korean companies. The marketplace is increasing utilization\nof the OLED display for smartphone and other consumer electronics due to expanded AMOLED capacity as well\nas increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED display for the\ntime being. We are encouraged by the progress we have made, and our development which started from smartphone,\nand subsequently extended to wearable, tablet and automotive with Chinese panel makers. We believe AMOLED\ndriver ICs will soon become one of the major growth engines for our small and medium display driver IC business.\nHowever, we could not assure you the success of our AMOLED driver IC as we are unable to penetrate into the\nmass volume existing Korean supplier chain and/or find new AMOLED panel manufactures to design-wins our\nsolutions into. AMOLED process maturity for the new manufactures and the possible specification change due to the\nimmaturity of the AMOLED will also be a hurdle to our AMOLED share gain and success.\nWe depend primarily on third-party foundries to manufacture our wafers, and any failure to obtain sufficient\nfoundry capacity or loss of any of the foundries we use could significantly delay our ability to ship our products,\ncausing us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nAccess to foundry capacity is crucial to our business because we do not manufacture our own wafers, instead\nrelying primarily on third-party foundries. The ability of a foundry to manufacture our semiconductor products is\nlimited by its available capacity. Access to capacity is especially important due to the limited availability of the high-\nvoltage CMOS process technology required for the manufacture of wafers used in display drivers. If the primary\nthird-party foundries that we rely upon are not able to meet our required capacity, or if our business relationships\nwith these foundries are adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity to meet increasing\ndemand for our products. We may have to seek alternative foundries, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or which may expose us to qualifying-new-foundry risks, as further discussed below.\nWe use several foundries for different semiconductor products, and certain of our products are manufactured at\nonly one of these foundries. If any one of the foundries is unable to provide the required capacity to us, or does not\ndeliver in a timely manner, or the quality or pricing terms are not acceptable to us, or any of the foundries experience\nfinancial difficulties or insolvency risks due to the impact of the global economic turmoil or any company-specific\nreasons or otherwise, if their operations are damaged or if there is any other disruption, directly or indirectly, of\ntheir foundry operations and we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in a timely manner, we could\nexperience significant delays in receiving the product being manufactured by that foundry or incur additional costs\nto obtain substitutes, or interruption in our supply of the affected products. If we choose to use a new foundry or\nprocess technology for a particular semiconductor product, it will take us several quarters to qualify the new foundry\nor process before we can begin shipping. If we cannot qualify a new foundry in a timely manner, we may experience\nand incur damages as above mentioned and harm our customer relationships.\nAs a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of our wafers, we face several significant risks, including: (1)\nfailure to secure manufacturing capacity, or being able to obtain required capacity only at higher costs; (2) risks of\nour proprietary information leaking to our competitors through the foundries we use; (3) limited control of delivery\nschedules, quality assurance and control, manufacturing yields and wafer costs; (4) the unavailability of, or potential\ndelays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and (5) financial risks of certain of our foundry suppliers.\nTo manufacture our display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, we require foundries with high-voltage CMOS\nmanufacturing process capacity. As a result, our dependence on high-voltage CMOS foundries presents the\nfollowing, additional risks: (1) potential capacity constraints faced by the limited number of high-voltage CMOS\nfoundries and the lack of investment in new and existing high-voltage CMOS foundries; (2) difficulty in attaining\nconsistently high manufacturing yields from high-voltage CMOS foundries; (3) delay and time required to qualify\nand ramp up production at new high-voltage CMOS foundries; and (4) price increases.\nAs a result, we may be required to use foundries with which we have no established relationships, which could\nexpose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover,\nthe scarcity of high-voltage foundry capacity may necessitate us making investments in foundries in order to secure\ncapacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional capital,\nwhich may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\n16\nMoreover, in year 2020, due to pandemic lockdown, the work-from-home and learn-from-home new lifestyles\ntriggered increasing demands for display and display drivers related products. The surging demand in display\ndrivers caused the severe foundry capacity shortage as a result, while the industry has no major expansion plan\nfor such capacity. On the other hand, major volume applications such as display drivers for TDDI and AMOLED,\nPMIC for 5G smartphone, and CIS which is continuously upgrading in resolution, are significantly expanding in\nwafer consumption and competing for the same pool of mature nodes the display drivers adopted. The 8-inch or\n180/150nm/110nm process, or the previous driver IC process, as well as the 12-inch or 110/80/55 nm process are\nall in short capacity supply and constantly increasing in cost. At the meantime, capacity shortage also occurred\ndue to persisting demand and high wafer consumption in 22nm/28nm/40nm or the previous nodes of logic process\nwhere Himax Tcon and logic products adopted. This change in production capacity may add risk to our operations\nthroughout the next few years as new product development is forced to switch to the 55 nm, 40 nm, 28 nm or even\nadvanced process which increase new product development expense.\nOur inability to secure sufficient capacity from any of our third-party tape, assembly and testing houses at\nreasonable and competitive prices could disrupt our shipments, harm our customer relationships and reduce\nour sales.\nAccess to third-party tape, assembly and testing capacity is critical to our business because we do not have in-\nhouse tape, assembly and testing capabilities for commercial production and instead rely on third-party service\nproviders. Access to these services is especially important to our business because display drivers require specialized\ntape, assembly and testing services. A limited number of third-party tape, assembly and testing houses tape, assemble\nand test substantially all of our current products. There has been an increased level of industry consolidation among\nour suppliers in recent years. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to bargain for higher prices, longer\ncontract terms, higher deposit and/or higher contract breach penalties for their services and products, which could\nresult in an increase in our average unit cost and/or penalty expenses. We do not have binding long-term supply\narrangements with tape, assembly and testing service providers that guarantee us access to our required capacity.\nIf the primary tape, assembly and testing service providers that we rely upon are not able to meet our requirements\nin price, quality, and service, or if our business relationships with these service providers were adversely affected,\nwe would not be able to obtain the required capacity and would have to seek alternative providers, which may\nnot be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we do not directly control our product\ndelivery schedules, tape, assembly and testing costs, and quality assurance and control. If any of these third-party\ntape, assembly and testing houses experiences capacity constraints, financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its\nfacilities or if there is any disruption of its assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative\nassembly and testing services in a timely manner. Because of the amount of time we usually take to qualify assembly\nand testing houses, we may experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative\nsources. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage our\nreputation and result in a loss of customers and orders. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of tape, assembly and\ntesting services may necessitate us making investments in tape, assembly and testing service providers in order to\nsecure capacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional\ncapital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of key components for our customers’ products could decrease demand for our products.\nShortages of components and other materials that are critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’\nproducts may limit our sales. These components and other materials include, but are not limited to, color filters,\nbacklight modules, polarizers, printed circuit boards and glass substrates. In the past, companies that use our\nproducts in their production have experienced delays in the availability of key components from other suppliers.\nIn addition, component manufacturers may not be able to increase or maintain their component supply because\nof labor shortage in China or otherwise and may shut down certain of their capacity from time to time because of\nweak demand, which may increase the instability of timely delivery and the risk of shortage of components. Such\nshortages of components and other materials critical to the design and manufacture of our customers’ products may\ncause a slowdown in demand for our products, resulting in a decrease in our sales and adversely affecting our results\nof operations. In addition, as a result of uncertain demand conditions, our customers may hesitate to build inventory\non hand and tend to release orders on short notice.\nWe rely on the services of our key personnel, and if we are unable to retain our current key personnel and hire\nadditional personnel, our ability to design, develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.\n17\nWe rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key personnel, including\nJordan Wu, our president and chief executive officer, and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu, our chairman, certain engineering,\ntechnical and senior management personnel, in particular, who are critical to our corporate management, business\noperation strategy, operation execution, future technological and product innovations. Competition for these\npersonnel is intense in semiconductor industry in Taiwan. Moreover, our future success depends on the expansion\nof our senior management team and the retention of key employees. Any of our key employees could leave our\ncompany with little or no prior notice and could then work with a competitor. In addition, we do not have “key\nperson” life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any key personnel or our inability to\nattract or retain qualified personnel, whether engineers or others, could delay the development and introduction\nof new products and would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and may impact our overall\nbusiness and growth. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert the attention of other\nsenior executives away from their original duties to recruiting replacements for key personnel.\nIf we fail to forecast customer demand accurately, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which may\nincrease our operating costs and harm our business.\nThe lead time required by the semiconductor manufacturing service providers is typically longer than the lead\ntime that our customers provide for delivery of our products to them. To ensure availability of our products for our\ncustomers, we will typically ask our semiconductor manufacturing service providers to start manufacturing our\nproducts based on forecasts provided by our customers in advance of receiving their purchase orders. However,\nthese forecasts are not binding purchase commitments, and we do not recognize revenues until they are delivered\nto customers. Moreover, for the convenience of our customers, we may agree to ship our inventory to warehouses\nlocated near our customers, so that our products can be delivered to customers more quickly. In such cases, we will\nnot recognize revenues until the control over a product to our customers based on the shipping terms. Hence, we\nincur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenues.\nThe anticipated demand for our products may not materialize; therefore, manufacturing based on customer\nforecasts exposes us to risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased product obsolescence, and erosion of the\nproducts’ market value. If we overestimate demand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments\ndelayed, we may incur excess inventory that we cannot sell, or may have to sell at low profit margins or even at a\nloss, which would harm our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have sufficient\ninventory and may lose market share and damage customer relationships, which also could harm our business. These\ninventory risks are exacerbated by the high level of customization of our products, which limits our ability to sell\nexcess inventory to other customers, which could eventually lead to write-down of these excess inventory.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future, our ability to grow will be limited.\nOur future success depends on our customers designing our products into their products. To achieve design\nwins, we must design and deliver cost-effective, innovative, reliable and integrated products for our customers’\nneeds. Panel manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs and time\nassociated with qualifying a new supplier. A design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to purchase our\nproducts and may not result in large volume orders of our products. Rather, it is a decision by a customer to use our\nproducts in the design process of that customer’s products. Accordingly, our failure to successfully design, develop\nand introduce new products and product enhancements could harm our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur products are complex and may require modifications to resolve undetected errors or failures in order for\nthem to function with panels at the desired specifications, which could lead to higher costs, customer dispute,\na loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain undetected errors or failures. Our products must operate\naccording to specifications with the other components used by our customers in their product manufacturing process.\nIf our products are delivered with errors or defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement\ncosts, and our credibility and the market acceptance of our products could be harmed and may along with possible\nliability indemnification for defective, customer dispute and lawsuits against us or our customers.\nOur highly integrated products are difficult to manufacture without defects. The existence of defects in our\nproducts could increase our costs, decrease our sales and damage our customer relationships and our\nreputation.\n18\nThe manufacture of our products that incorporate mixed analog and digital signal processing and embedded\nmemory technology is complex and it is difficult for semiconductor foundries to manufacture completely without\ndefects. Minor deviations in the manufacturing process could cause substantial reduction in yield and quality.\nDefective products can be caused by design, defective materials or component parts, or manufacturing\ndifficulties. Thus, quality problems can be identified only by analyzing and testing our display drivers in a system\nafter they have been manufactured. Difficulties in achieving defect-free products due to the increasing complexity\nof display drivers and the panel system may result in an increase in our costs and expenses, and delays in the\navailability of our products. In addition, if the foundries that we use fail to deliver products of satisfactory quality in\nthe volume and at the price required, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand or to sell those products at an\nacceptable profit margin, which could adversely affect our sales and margins and damage our customer relationships\nand our reputation.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant\nuncertainty and volatility with respect to our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nWe may not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers; our sales are made on the basis of\nindividual purchase orders. Our customers may also cancel or defer purchase orders. Our customers’ purchase orders\nmay vary significantly from period to period, and it is difficult to forecast future order quantities. In the event of\na cancellation, postponement, or reduction of an order, we would likely not be able to reduce operating expenses\nsufficiently so as to minimize the impact of the lost revenues. Alternatively, we may have excess inventory that we\ncannot sell, which would harm our operating results. In addition, changes in our customers’ business may adversely\naffect the quantity of purchase orders that we receive by reducing or canceling their orders of our products, and/\nor requesting higher-than-usual price concessions. We cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue\nto place orders with us in the future. We also cannot assure you that the volume of our customers’ orders will be\nconsistent with our expectations when we plan our expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition\nmay thus be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the purchase order cancelations or negative alternation\nby customer may lead to reduction in future earnings or cash flows subject to each event.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by officers, directors and affiliated entities who may take\nactions that are not in, or may conflict with, our or our public shareholders’ interests.\nAs of February 28, 2021, Jordan Wu and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu (who are brothers) beneficially owned approximately\n2.1% and 21.4% of our ordinary shares, respectively. For information relating to the beneficial ownership of our\nordinary shares, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” These\nshareholders, acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders,\nincluding electing directors and approving mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration\nof ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our\nshareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares as part of a sale of our company and might\nreduce the price of our ADSs. Actions may be taken even if they were opposed by our other shareholders.\nAssertions against us by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights could result in\nsignificant costs and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights\nand positions, which results in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have received, and\nexpect to continue to receive, notices of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. We may receive\nclaims from various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual\nproperty rights in the future. Any lawsuit resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability\nfor damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely\nbe time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention. Any potential\nintellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following: (1) stop selling products\nor using technology or manufacturing processes that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property; (2)\npay damages to the party claiming infringement; (3) attempt to obtain a license for the relevant intellectual property,\nwhich may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; and (4) attempt to redesign those products\nthat contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property with non-infringing intellectual property, which may not be\npossible.\n19\nThe outcome of a dispute may result in our need to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or\nlicensing agreements. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out\nof the sale of our products. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business,\noperating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important\nto the success of our business. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and\ncopyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual properties. These afford only limited\nprotection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain,\ncopy or use information that we regard as proprietary, such as product design and manufacturing process\nexpertise. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not result in issued patents or may\nnot be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Moreover, policing any unauthorized use of\nour products is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the measures which we have implemented\nwill prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in foreign jurisdictions\nwhere the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the United States. Others may\nindependently develop substantially equivalent intellectual properties or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets\nor intellectual properties. Our failure to protect our intellectual properties effectively could harm our business.\nWe may undertake acquisitions or investments to expand our business that may pose risks to\nour business and dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders, and we may not realize the\nanticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire\nor invest in other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current offerings,\nexpand the breadth of markets we can address or enhance our technical capabilities. Acquisitions or investments\nthat we have completed or potentially may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and\nadversely affect our business, operating and financial results, including: (1) problems integrating the acquired\nkey employees, operations, technologies or products into our existing business and products; (2) diversion of\nmanagement’s time and attention from our core business; (3) adverse effects of losses of the acquired target upon our\nfinancial condition and results of operations; (4) adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers;\n(5) the need for financial resources above our planned investment levels; (6) dilution of share ownership of current\nshareholders under share swap transactions; (7) risks associated with entering markets in which we lack experience;\n(8) potential write-offs of acquired assets; and (9) potential impairment charges related to the goodwill acquired.\nWe may also face challenges in international acquisitions, such as compliance with local law and regulation,\nlimited access to target company and cultural assimilation challenges. Our failure to address these risks successfully\nmay have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any such acquisition\nor investment may require a significant amount of capital investment, which would decrease the amount of\ncash available for working capital or capital expenditures. In addition, if we use our equity securities to pay for\nacquisitions, the value of our ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares may be diluted. If we borrow funds to finance\nacquisitions, such debt instruments may contain restrictive covenants that can, among other things, restrict us from\ndistributing dividends.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches or unexpected system outage or failures could impact our\nbusiness.\nOur computer systems and networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, power\nloss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other malicious attempts. The reliability and\nsafety of our information technology infrastructure / software, and the ability to continually expand and update\ntechnologies / software in response to dynamic changing needs and cybersecurity threats, are critical to our business.\nIn recent years, there are increasing and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers,\nstate-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance and human / technological errors. All\nabove could result in the loss of our intellectual property, the leak of commercially sensitive information, and the\nmisappropriation of confidential information of our employees, customers and suppliers, and therefore could cause\nthe interruption of our business. Failures to protect the privacy of employees, customers or suppliers’ confidential\ndata against breaches of network security could result in the loss of existing or potential customers, other financial\nloss, and damage to our reputation. In addition, the operational cost and consequences against breaches and\n20\nremedial measures could be significant. While we seek to annually review and assess our cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness, we still cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible to new\nand emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As of February 28, 2021, we had\nnot been aware of any material cyberattacks or incidents that had or would expected to have a materially adverse\neffect on our business and operations, nor had we been involved in any legal proceedings or regulatory investigations\nrelated thereof.\nOur data centers are subject to the risk of break-ins and sabotage. Our disaster recovery plan cannot account\nfor all eventualities. Consequently, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our\ndata centers could result in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business.\nSome of our system services are based on public cloud services, which are also subject to interruption due to\ncloud service providers’ unexpected downtimes, cyberattacks or any type of failure, telecommunication failure\nand/or other unidentified problems while connecting to cloud. These cloud services interruptions could result\nin loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our services and business. Cloud cybersecurity\nbreach could result in adverse effect on our customers, employees, suppliers, reputation, and business.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our revenues\nand operating results.\nThe price of each semiconductor product typically declines over its product life cycle, reflecting product\nobsolescence, decreased demand as customers shift to more advanced products, decreased unit costs due to advanced\ndesigns or improved manufacturing yields, and increased competition as more semiconductor suppliers are able\nto offer similar products. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results if\nour average selling prices decline. We may reduce the average unit price of our products in response to competitive\npricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and other factors. We expect that these\nfactors will create downward pressure on our average selling prices and operating results. If we are unable to offset\nany reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost\nreductions, or if we fail to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis, our revenues\nand operating results will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly competitive,\nand we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors.\nIncreased competition in semiconductor industry may result in pricing pressure, reduced profitability and loss of\nmarket share, any of which could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations. We continually face intense\ncompetition from fabless display driver companies and integrated device manufacturers. Some of our competitors\nhave substantially greater financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and\ndistribution of their products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands\nor devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products. Some of our competitors\nare affiliated with, or are subsidiaries of, our panel manufacturer customers. These relationships may also give our\ncompetitors significant advantages such as early access to product roadmaps and design-in priorities, which would\nallow them to respond more quickly to changing customer demands and achieve more design-wins than we can. We\ncannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues and market share or compete successfully\nagainst our competitors in the semiconductor industry.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to anticipate changes in evolving industry\nstandards, fail to achieve and maintain technological leadership in our industry or fail to develop and\nintroduce new and enhanced products.\nOur products are generally based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The emergence of new\nindustry standards could render our products or those of our customers unmarketable or obsolete and may require us\nto incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any such new standards. Our past sales and profitability have\nresulted, to a significant extent, from our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards, and\nto develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely fashion. If we do not anticipate these changes in\ntechnologies and rapidly develop and introduce new and innovative technologies, we may not be able to provide\nadvanced display semiconductors on competitive terms, and some of our customers may buy products from our\ncompetitors instead of from us. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes and anticipate future standards will\n21\nbe a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our growth prospects. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to anticipate evolving industry standards, successfully complete the design of our\nnew products, have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields, or obtain significant purchase\norders for these products to meet new standards or technologies. If we fail to anticipate changes in technology and\nto introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business and results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure\nOur ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by\ncommercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow,\nfund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist mainly of our 100% ownership interest in Himax Taiwan. We\nreceive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends\nin the past. Nonetheless, dividends and interest on shareholder loans that we receive from our subsidiaries in Taiwan,\nif any, will be subject to withholding tax under ROC law. The ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with loans,\npay dividends, repay any shareholder loans from us or make other distributions to us is restricted by, among other\nthings, the availability of funds, the terms of various credit arrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as\nstatutory and other legal restrictions. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially and\nadversely affect our ability to grow, finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, pay dividends, and otherwise\nfund and conduct our business.\nPolitical, Geographical and Economic Risks\nWe operate primarily in Taiwan that are vulnerable to natural disasters.\nMost of our operations, and the operations of many of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers,\nsuppliers and customers are located in Taiwan, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, in particular, earthquakes and\ntyphoons. Our principal foundries, tape and assembly and testing houses upon which we have relied to manufacture\nsubstantially all of our display drivers are located in Taiwan. As a result of this geographic concentration, disruption\nof operations at our facilities or the facilities of our semiconductor manufacturing service providers and suppliers\nfor any reason, including work stoppages, power outages, water supply shortages, fire, typhoons, earthquakes or\nother natural disasters, could cause delays in production and shipments of our products. In addition, shortages or\ninterruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government,\nsuch as to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country. Any delays or disruptions could result in our customers seeking to\nsource products from our competitors. If such disruption of operation at our customers’ facilities and our customers\nmay be required to shut down temporarily or to substantially reduce the operations of their fabs, these would\nseriously affect demand for our products.\nDisruptions in Taiwan’s political environment could negatively affect our business and ADSs market price.\nOur principal executive offices and a substantial amount of our assets are located in Taiwan, and a substantial\nportion of revenues is derived from operations in Taiwan. Our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ADSs market price may be affected by changes in ROC policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, and by\nsocial instability and diplomatic that are outside of our control.\nTaiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and the PRC have been separately\ngoverned. The government of the PRC claims that it is the sole government in China and that Taiwan is part of\nChina. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between\nTaiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has refused to renounce the possibility that it may at some point use\nforce to gain control over Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC government adopted an anti-secession law relating to\nTaiwan. Relations between the ROC and the PRC governments have been strained in recent years for a variety of\nreasons, including the PRC government’s position on the “One China” policy and tensions concerning arms sales to\nTaiwan by the United States government. Any tension between the ROC and the PRC, or between the United States\nand the PRC, could materially and adversely affect our ADSs market prices.\nA substantial portion of our sales are made to customers in the PRC, which may expose us to additional political,\nregulatory, and economic risks.\n22\nWe have been increasingly selling our products to customers in the PRC. In 2019 and 2020, approximately 70.3%\nand 79.7% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in the PRC. We expect to continue to\nincrease our sales to customers in the PRC in the future. With regional customer concentration, we are particularly\nsubject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in the PRC.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the\nstructure, level of government involvement, level of development, foreign exchange control and allocation of\nresources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy\nand is growing rapidly. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented economic reform measures\nemphasizing utilization of market forces in the development of the economy and also adjusted its macroeconomic\ncontrol policies from time to time. These policies have led and may continue to lead to changes in market conditions.\nBesides, US sanction on China, any new tariffs, legislation and/or regulations are implemented, or if existing trade\nagreements are renegotiated or, in particular, if the U.S. government takes retaliatory trade actions due to recent\nU.S.-China trade tensions, such changes could have an adverse effect on our customers or suppliers in China. We\ncannot predict whether changes in the PRC’s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies\nwill have any adverse effect on our customers in the PRC. In addition, the interpretation of PRC laws and regulations\ninvolves uncertainties. We cannot assure you that changes in such laws and regulations, or in their interpretation and\nenforcement, will not have a material adverse effect on the businesses and operations of our customers in the PRC\nand consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses and affect our results of operations.\nOur functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. In 2020, more than 99% of our revenues and cost of\nrevenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency exposure and are primarily affected\nby fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar. This is because a majority portion of\nour employees and facilities are based in Taiwan and operating expenses are denominated in NT dollars and we\nmaintain a portion of our cash in NT dollars for Taiwan working capital purposes. For example, in December 2020,\napproximately 76% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage denominated\nin Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel new shekel and Chinese Renminbi, and the majority of the remainder in\nU.S. dollars. As a result, any significant fluctuations to our disadvantage in exchange rate of U.S. dollars against\nsuch currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on our\noperating expenses as expressed in U.S. dollar and adversely affected operating profit.\nChanges in ROC tax laws would likely increase our tax expenditures and decrease our net income.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and development\nexpenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15% of the total qualifying\nresearch and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for\nthe current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for Industrial Innovation may not be\ncarried forward. Based on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019,\nfurther extended to December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit\nrate will be 10% of the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject to a\ncap of 30% of the income tax payable for each year.\nAccording to the amendments to the “Income Tax Act” enacted by the office of the President of the ROC on\nFebruary 7, 2018, an increase in the statutory income tax rate from 17% to 20% and decrease in the undistributed\nearning tax from 10% to 5% are effective from January 1, 2018. This increase affected the Company’s current tax\nexpense from 2018, and deferred taxes were remeasured in 2018, the period of enactment.\nOn July 12, 2016, the ROC Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of anti-avoidance to establish Article 43-3\nControlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules and Article 43-4 Place of Effective Management (“PEM”) rules of the\nIncome Tax Act (“ITA”). Detailed introduction of the CFC and PEM rules are described as follows:\n(i) A profit-seeking enterprise (“PSE”) that directly or indirectly owns affiliated enterprises in low-tax\njurisdictions outside the territory of the ROC shall recognize and include its pro rata share of affiliated\nenterprises’ annual profits as investment income in its income tax return for the year. Subsequent\nactual dividends and distributions from such affiliated enterprises that were previously recognized as\ninvestment income will then not be subject to income taxation; any surplus to previously recognized\n23\ninvestment income shall be included as taxable income in the allocated year. Low-tax jurisdictions are\ndefined as countries where the PSE income tax rate is lower than 70% of the income tax rate of the\nPSE in the ROC (the statutory income tax rate is 20% from January 1, 2018) (Article 43-3 CFC rules);\nand\n(ii) A PSE is incorporated based on foreign legislation but its place of effective management (PEM) is\nmaintained within the territory of the ROC, and the head office of such PSE will be determined to be\nwithin the territory of the ROC and profit-seeking enterprise income tax shall be levied in accordance\nwith the ITA and relevant tax regulations. The aforementioned PEM refers to a place where\nsubstantive key management and commercial decisions of an entity’s business and its operations are\nmade (Article 43-4 PEM rule).\nAccording to the legislative intent, the CFC and PEM rules, in principle, will not be put into force immediately,\nbut will wait until the China-Taiwan Cross-Strait Tax Agreement is effectuated, the OECD’s Common Reporting\nand Due Diligence Standard (“CRS”) for the automatic exchange of information of financial accounts is widely\nimplemented internationally, and the relevant bylaws of the CFC and PEM rules have been adequately enacted and\nproperly advocated. The date of implementation will be determined by the Executive Yuan. Additionally, dividend\npayments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However, if the relevant bylaws\nof the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be determined to be within the\nterritory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income Tax Act and relevant tax\nregulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax in the ROC.\nWe may be affected by the Cayman Economic Substance Law\nPursuant to the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision) (as amended) of the\nCayman Islands (the “ES Act”), a “relevant entity” is required to satisfy the economic substance test set out in the\nES Act. A “relevant entity” includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands as is our company.\nBased on the current interpretation of the ES Act, we believe that our company, Himax Technologies, Inc., is a pure\nequity holding company since it only holds equity participation in other entities and only earns dividends and capital\ngains.\nAccordingly, for so long as our company is a “pure equity holding company”, it is only subject to the minimum\nsubstance requirements, which require us to (i) comply with all applicable filing requirements under the Companies\nAct (2021 Revision) of the Cayman Islands; and (ii) has adequate human resources and adequate premises in the\nCayman Islands for holding and managing equity participations in other entities. However, there can be no assurance\nthat we will not be subject to more requirements under the ES Act. Uncertainties over the interpretation and\nimplementation of the ES Act may have an adverse impact on our business and operations.\nRisks Relating to Our ADSs and Our Trading Market\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile.\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile and has ranged from a low of $1.73 to a high of $8.3 on the NASDAQ\nGlobal Select Market in 2020.\nThe market price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following: (1)\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results; (2) changes in financial estimates by securities\nresearch analysts; (3) changes in the expectation of our product launch timing, forecast and estimates; (4) conditions\nin the TFT-LCD panel market; (5) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other display\nsemiconductor companies; (6) announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic\npartnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; (7) the addition or departure of key personnel; (8) fluctuations\nin exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar; (9) litigation related to our intellectual property; and (10)\nthe release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or sales of additional ADSs.\nIn addition, as a result of the worldwide financial crisis, global stock markets have experienced extreme price\nand volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many\ncompanies for reasons which may not be directly related to their operating performance, including but not limited\nto events such as tax-loss selling, mutual fund redemptions, hedge fund redemptions and margin calls. These market\nfluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs.\n24\nFuture sales or perceived sales of securities by us, our executive officers, directors or major shareholders may\nhurt the price of our ADSs.\nThe market price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales of ADSs or shares or the perception that these\nsales could occur. As of February 28, 2021, we had 348,178,330 outstanding shares and a significant number of our\nshares were beneficially owned by certain major shareholders such as our directors and executive officers. See “Item\n7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” If we, our executive officers, or\ndirectors or our shareholders sell ADSs or shares, the market price for our shares or ADSs could decline.\nYou may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive voting\nmaterials sufficiently in advance to be able to exercise your right to vote.\nExcept as described in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting rights\nattaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will appoint the\ndepositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to the shares represented by\nthe ADSs. In certain circumstances, the depositary shall refrain from voting and any voting instructions received\nfrom ADS holders shall lapse. Furthermore, in certain other circumstances, the depositary will give us a discretionary\nproxy to vote shares evidenced by ADSs. You may not receive voting materials sufficiently in advance to instruct the\ndepositary to vote or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties will not have the\nopportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities. Under\nthe deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless both the rights\nand the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the Securities Act, or\nexempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are under no obligation\nto file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to endeavor to cause such a\nregistration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take advantage of any exemptions\nfrom registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may be unable to participate in our\nrights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.\nYou may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.\nYour ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the depositary\nmay close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenever it deems expedient in connection with\nthe performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or register transfers of\nADSs generally when books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any time if we or the depositary\ndeem it necessary or advisable to do so because of any requirement of law, any government, governmental body,\ncommission, or any securities exchange on which our ADSs or ordinary shares are listed, or under any provision of\nthe deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the deposited securities or any meeting of our shareholders, or\nfor any other reason.\nYour ability to protect your rights through the United States federal courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct a substantial portion of our operations in Taiwan, and all of\nour directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. However, a substantial portion of our operations is conducted in\nTaiwan through Himax Taiwan, our wholly owned subsidiary, and substantially all of our assets are located in\nTaiwan. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of\nthose persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an\naction against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have\nbeen infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind,\nthe laws of the Cayman Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to enforce a United States judgment against\nour assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no statutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of\njudgments obtained in the United States, although a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of\nthe United States under which a sum of money is payable, other than a sum payable in respect of multiple damages,\ntaxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty, may be subject to enforcement\nproceedings as debt in the courts of the Cayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation, provided that\n25\n(a) such federal or state courts of the United States had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment;\n(b) such federal or state courts of the United States did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman\nIslands; (c) such judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to\nthe public policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior to\nthe rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with the correct\nprocedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\nTherefore, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against\nour management, directors or major shareholders than shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in\nthe United States.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder because judicial precedents regarding\nshareholders’ rights are more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, and because Cayman\nIslands law generally provides less protection to shareholders than U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law, Cap. 22\n(Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman Islands Companies Law, and the\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against directors, actions by minority\nshareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent\ngoverned by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law is derived in part from comparatively\nlimited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but\nnot binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities\nof directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial\nprecedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of\nsecurities law than the United States.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n4.A. History and Development of the Company\nHimax Taiwan, our predecessor, was incorporated on June 12, 2001 as a limited liability company under the laws\nof the ROC. On April 26, 2005, we established Himax Technologies Limited, an exempted company with limited\nliability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as a holding company to hold the shares of Himax Taiwan in\nconnection with our reorganization and share exchange. On October 14, 2005, Himax Taiwan became our wholly\nowned subsidiary through a share exchange consummated pursuant to the ROC Business Mergers and Acquisitions\nLaw through which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Himax Taiwan, and we issued ordinary\nshares to the shareholders of Himax Taiwan. Shareholders of Himax Taiwan received one of our ordinary shares in\nexchange for one Himax Taiwan common share. The share exchange was unanimously approved by shareholders\nof Himax Taiwan on June 10, 2005 with no dissenting shareholders and by the ROC Investment Commission on\nAugust 30, 2005 for our inbound investment in Taiwan, and on September 7, 2005 for our outbound investment\noutside of Taiwan. We effected this reorganization and share exchange to comply with ROC laws, which prohibit a\nTaiwan incorporated company not otherwise publicly listed in Taiwan from listing its shares on an overseas stock\nexchange. Our reorganization enables us to maintain our operations through our Taiwan subsidiary, Himax Taiwan,\nwhile allowing us to list our shares overseas through our holding company structure.\nOn September 26, 2005, we changed our name to “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” and on October 17, 2005, Himax\nTaiwan changed its name to “Himax Technologies Limited” upon the approval of shareholders of both companies\nand amendments to the respective constitutive documents. We effected the name exchange in order to maintain\ncontinuity of operations and marketing under the trade name “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” which had been previously\nused by Himax Taiwan.\nOur ADSs have been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market since March 31, 2006. Our ordinary shares\nare not listed or publicly traded on any trading markets.\nIn February 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wisepal, currently known as Himax Semiconductor, Inc., a\nfabless semiconductor company focusing on the development of LTPS TFT-LCD drivers for small and medium-\nsized applications. This transaction strengthened our competitive position in the small and medium-sized product\nareas and further diversified our technology and product offerings. For management purpose, Himax Semiconductor\nInc. was merged into Himax Taiwan on July 2, 2018.\n26\nIn March 2007, we established Himax Imaging, Inc., or Himax Imaging, which develops and markets CMOS\nimage sensors with an initial focus on camera applications used in cell phones and notebook computers.\nIn July 2012, our subsidiary, Himax Display, completed the acquisition of Spatial Photonics, currently known\nas Himax Display (USA) Inc., a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and production of\nMEMS products.\nIn June 2018, we completed the acquisition of Emza Visual Sense Ltd., or Emza, which is dedicated to the\ndevelopment of visual sensors that include proprietary machine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that\nenable always-on visual sensing capabilities, achieving improvement in power consumption, price and form factor.\nFrom time to time, we have also made minority investments in various companies for strategic purposes in the\nordinary course of business.\nOur principal executive offices are located at No. 26, Zih Lian Road, Sinshih District, Tainan City 74148,\nTaiwan, Republic of China. Our telephone number at this address is +886-6-505-0880. Our registered office in the\nCayman Islands is located at Cricket Square, Hutchins Drive, P.O. Box 2681, Grand Cayman KY1-1111, Cayman\nIslands. Our telephone number at this address is +1-345-945-3901. In addition, we have offices in Hsinchu and\nTaipei, Taiwan; Foshan, Fuqing, Ningbo, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou, Wuhan, Hefei, Qingdao, Chongqing,\nXi’an and Xiamen, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South Korea; Givatayim, Israel; and Irvine and\nCampbell, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.\nInvestor inquiries should be directed to our Investor Relations department by email to hx_ir@himax.com.tw.\nThe SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information\nregarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

We also work with\ncamera module manufacturers, optical engine manufacturers, and television system manufacturers for various non-\ndriver products.\nIndustry Background\nWe mainly operate in the flat panel display semiconductor industry. As the majority of our revenues derive from\nproducts that are critical components of flat panel displays, such as display drivers, timing controllers, power ICs and\nother semiconductor products, our industry is closely linked to the trends and developments of the flat panel display\nindustry.\nFlat Panel Display Semiconductors\nFlat panel displays require different semiconductors depending upon the display technologies and the\napplications. Some of the most important ones include the following:\n• Display Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers precise\nanalog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The major application of display driver IC is\nused on TFT-LCDs. However, AMOLED display is also getting more and more popular in recently years,\nstarting from high-end smartphone and TV applications. Detailed display driver IC specification for LCD\nand AMOLED are different due to panel characteristics. The two main types of display drivers for a display\npanel are gate drivers and source drivers. Gate drivers turn on the transistor within each pixel cell on the\n27\nhorizontal line on the panel for data input at each row. Source drivers receive image data from the timing\ncontroller and generate voltage that is applied to the liquid crystal within each pixel cell on the vertical line\non the panel for data input at each column. The combination determines the colors generated by each pixel.\nTypically, multiple gate drivers and source drivers are installed separately on the panel. However, for\ncertain small and medium-sized applications, gate drivers and source drivers are integrated into a single\nchip due to space and cost considerations. Large-sized panels typically have higher resolution and require\nmore display drivers than small and medium-sized panels.\n• Timing Controller. The timing controller receives image data and converts the format for the source\ndrivers’ input. The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate and source drivers.\nTypically, the timing controller is a discrete semiconductor in large-sized TFT-LCD panels. For certain\nsmall and medium-sized applications, however, the timing controller may be integrated with display\ndrivers.\n• Operational Amplifier. An operational amplifier supplies the reference voltage to source drivers in order to\nmake their output voltage uniform.\n• Power IC. Power ICs include certain drivers, amplifiers, DC to DC converters and other semiconductors\ndesigned to enhance power management, such as voltage regulation, voltage boosting and battery\nmanagement.\n• Touch controller IC. For touch screen applications, touch controller ICs enable touch interfaces, such as\ncapacitive touch panels, to identify, qualify and track user’s contacts with precision and sensibility.\n• Others. Flat panel displays also require multiple general purposes semiconductors such as memory, power\nconverters and inverters.\nCharacteristics of the Display Driver Market\nAlthough we operate in several distinct segments of the flat panel display semiconductor industry, our principal\nproducts are display drivers. Display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays. The display driver market\nhas specific characteristics, including those discussed below.\nConcentration of Panel Manufacturers\nThe global TFT-LCD panel industry consists of a small number of manufacturers, substantially all of which are\nbased in Asia. In recent years, Korean TFT-LCD panel makers gradually undergo restructure to shift their technology\nand manufacture focus from TFT-LCD to OLED and TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, especially China-based\nmanufacturers, have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct and ramp up additional fab\ncapacity. The capital-intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel manufacturers operating at a\nhigh level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to create a temporary oversupply of panels,\nwhich reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing pressure on component companies including\ndisplay driver companies. Moreover, the concentration of panel manufacturers permits major panel manufacturers to\nexert pricing pressure on display driver companies such as us. The small number of panel manufacturers exacerbates\nthis situation as display driver companies, in addition to seeking to expand their customer base, must also focus on\nwinning a larger percentage of such customers’ display driver requirements.\nCustomization Requirements\nEach panel display has a unique pixel design to meet its particular requirements. To optimize the panel’s\nperformance, display drivers have to be customized for each panel design. The most common customization\nrequirement is for the display driver company to optimize the gamma curve of each display driver for each panel\ndesign. Display driver companies must work closely with their customers to develop semiconductors that meet their\ncustomers’ specific needs in order to optimize the performance of their products.\nMixed-Signal Design and High-Voltage CMOS Process Technology\nDisplay drivers have specific design and manufacturing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor\nindustry. Some display drivers require mixed-signal design since they combine both analog and digital devices on\na single semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data. Manufacturing display drivers require high-\n28\nvoltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5 to 24 volts for source drivers and 10 to 50 volts\nfor gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in the semiconductor industry. For display drivers, the\ndriving voltage must be maintained under a very high degree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve\nusing standard CMOS process technology. Moreover, manufacturing display drivers does not require very small-\ngeometry semiconductor processes. Typically, the manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require\ngeometries between 0.11 micron and 1 micron because the physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not\nallow for the economical reduction in geometries below this range. We believe that there are a limited number\nof fabs with high-voltage CMOS process technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing of display\ndrivers.\nSpecial Assembly and Testing Requirements\nManufacturing display drivers requires certain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that are not\nstandard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited number of providers. The assembly of display\ndrivers typically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass, also known as COG,\ntechnologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold bumps are plated\nonto each wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and the glass, in the\ncase of COG packages. TAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip on film, also known\nas COF. The type of assembly used depends on the panel manufacturer’s design, which is influenced by panel\nsize and application and is typically determined by the panel manufacturers. Display drivers for large-sized\napplications typically require TAB package and, to a lesser extent, COG package types, whereas display drivers\nfor smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products typically require COG packages. The testing of display\ndrivers also requires special testers that can support high-channel and high-voltage output semiconductors. Such\ntesters are not standard in the semiconductor industry.\nSupply Chain Management\nThe manufacturing of display drivers is complex and requires several manufacturing stages such as wafer\nfabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing, and the availability of materials such as the processed\ntape used in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and material requirements collectively\nas the “supply chain”. Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of capacity utilization and require\na reliable supply of display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this supply, may disrupt\npanel manufacturers’ operations. As a result, a company’s ability to deliver its products on a timely basis at the\nquality and quantity required is critical to satisfying its existing customers and winning new ones. Such supply\nchain management is particularly crucial to fabless display driver companies that do not have their own in-house\nmanufacturing capacity. In the case of display drivers, supply chain management is further complicated by the\nhigh-voltage CMOS process technology and the special assembly and testing requirements that are not standard\nin the semiconductor industry. Access to this capacity also depends in part on display driver companies having\nreceived assurances of demand for their products since semiconductor manufacturing service providers require\ncredible demand forecasts before allocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity to\nsupport growth.\nNeed for Higher Level of Integration\nThe small form factor of smartphone, tablet, automotive and certain consumer electronics products restricts\nthe space for components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically require one or more source\ndrivers, one or more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors or\nas an integrated single-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order to\nmanufacture more compact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display driver\ncompanies must be able to offer highly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver and timing\ncontroller, as well as semiconductors such as memory, power circuit and image processors, into a single chip. Due\nto the size restrictions and stringent power consumption constraints of such display drivers, single-chip drivers\nare complex to design. For large-sized panel applications, integration is both more difficult to achieve and less\nimportant since size and weight are less of a priority. Lastly, as some of our TFT-LCD panel customers had turned\nto pure in-cell TDDI panel development for thinner display designs, we have developed a series of single chip\ntouch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.\n29\nProducts and Solutions\nWe have several principal product lines:\n• display drivers and timing controllers;\n• touch controller ICs;\n• ASIC service;\n• LCOS and MEMS products;\n• power ICs;\n• CMOS image sensor products;\n• wafer level optics products;\n• 3D sensing business; and\n• Ultralow power smart sensing.\nDisplay Drivers and Timing Controllers\nDisplay Driver Characteristics\nDisplay drivers deliver precise analog voltages and currents that activate the pixels on panels. The following is a\nsummary of certain display driver characteristics and their relationship to panel performance.\n• Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied by the\nnumber of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed on a panel. For\nexample, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red columns, 1,024 green columns and\n1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and 768 rows. The red, green and blue columns are\ncommonly referred to as “RGB.” Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072 column outputs and 768\nrow outputs. The number of display drivers required for each panel depends on the resolution of the panel\nand the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA (1,024 x 768 pixels) panel requires\neight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three 256-channel gate drivers (768 = 256 x 3),\nwhile a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel requires eight 720-channel source drivers and four\n270-channel gate drivers. The number of display drivers required can be reduced by using drivers with a\nhigher number of channels. For example, a full HD panel can have six 960-channel source drivers instead\nof eight 720-channel source drivers. Thus, using display drivers with a higher number of channels can\nreduce the number of display drivers required for each panel, although display drivers with a higher number\nof channels typically have higher unit costs.\n• Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a screen, which is determined by\nthe number of shades of a color, also known as gray scale, that can be shown by the panel. For example, a\n6-bit source driver is capable of generating 26 x 26 x 26 = 218, or 262K colors, and similarly, an 8-bit source\ndriver is capable of generating 16 million colors. Typically, for TFT-LCD panels currently in commercial\nproduction, 262K, 16 million and 1 billion colors are supported by 6-bit, 8-bit and 10-bit source drivers,\nrespectively.\n• Operational Voltage.A display driver operates with two voltages: the input voltage (which enables it to\nreceive signals from the timing controller) and the output voltage (which, in the case of source drivers, is\napplied to liquid crystals and, in the case of gate drivers, is used to switch on the TFT device). Source\ndrivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from 4.5 to 24\nvolts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages ranging from\n10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers electromagnetic interference, or EMI. Output\nvoltage may be higher or lower depending on the characteristics of the liquid crystal (or diode), in the case\nof source drivers, or TFT device, in the case of gate drivers.\n30\n• Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to it by\nthe source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve” of the source driver. Different panel\ndesign and manufacturing processes require source drivers with different gamma curves. Display drivers\nneed to adjust the gamma curve to fit the pixel design. Due to the materials and processes used in\nmanufacturing, panels may contain certain imperfections which can be corrected by the gamma curve of\nthe source driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma correction.” For certain types of liquid\ncrystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly different and thus need to be independently\ncorrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three independent gamma curves for RGB cells.\n• Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display drivers.\nDisplay drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data\nvolume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data transmission applications, such as\ntelevisions, require more advanced interface technology. The principal types of interface technologies are\ntransistor-to-transistor logic, or TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS, mini-low voltage\ndifferential signaling, or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high-speed interface. Among these, RSDS,\nmini-LVDS and point-to-point interface were developed as low power, low noise and low amplitude\nmethods for high-speed data transmission using fewer copper wires and resulting in lower EMI. Moreover,\nthere are some panel manufacturers developing their proprietary point-to-point interfaces, such as\nembedded panel interface, or EPI, USI-T, iSP, CEDS, CHPI, CSPI and CMPI.\n• Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses TAB and COG package types. COF and TCP\nare two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly used in recent years.\nCustomers typically determine the package type required according to their specific mechanical and\nelectrical considerations. In general, display drivers for small-sized panels mainly use COG package types,\nwhereas display drivers for large-sized panels primarily use TAB package types and, to a lesser extent,\nCOG package types.\nLarge-Sized Applications\nWe provide source drivers, gate drivers, PMIC, P-gamma OP level shifter and timing controllers (TCON) for\nlarge-sized panels principally used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and televisions. Display drivers used\nin large-sized applications feature different key characteristics, depending on the end-use application. For example,\nthe industry trend for large-sized applications is generally toward super high channel, low power consumption,\nlow cost, thin and light form factor, touch function, higher data transmission rate and higher driving capabilities.\nHigher speed interface technologies are also key for 4Kx2K and 8Kx4K high-resolution TVs. Greater color depth,\nthermal solution, high data rate and high driving, are particularly important for advanced televisions and certain\nmonitors.\nOur large display driver IC business achieved several milestones from 2019. For example, we successfully\nadded 12-inch fabs into the pool of our foundry capacity for our large display driver ICs to ease the capacity\nshortage of 8” foundry where the vast majority of large panel driver ICs are fabricated. On high-end TV, Himax\noutpaced peers to lead the mass production of customized high-speed point-to-point (P2P) transmission using\nembedded panel intra interface such as iSP, CHPI, USI-T, CMPI, CEDS and CSPI for 4K TVs and developed a\n2-in-1 COF driver to meet the requirements of high channel count and heat dissipation for 8K TV. On gaming\nmonitor, we have high frame rate and high driving driver to meet various resolutions needs and frame rates such\nas UHD 165Hz, QHD 240Hz, FHD 360Hz, etc. We also successfully developed low power consumption driver\napplied in low power monitor to satisfied Energy Star 8.0 and even Energy Star 9.0. Lastly, our P2P driver and\nTCON ICs with 13.3\" FHD can meet Intel 1W project requirement.\nWe also made tremendous progress in TCON product lines in 2020. UHD TV penetration rate is larger than\n50% since 2019, and we developed competitive UHD TV TCON to seize this market. Himax UHD TV TCON\nhas mass production at all major China LCD makers and the shipment has double growth in 2020. We also\nprovide gaming TCON for the new QHD 240Hz and UHD 144Hz gaming monitor and notebook. For high-end\ngaming requirement, we have developed eDP 8.1G TCON to increase bandwidth. We also have embedded local\ndimming in TCON ICs for TFT-LCD automotive applications to support higher contrast instrument panels needed\nfor drivers to read the content of the meter quickly. Additionally, several key panel makers also seek Himax\ncooperation to develop OLED for automotive applications. Currently we are developing customized OLED ASIC\nfor these key panel makers which is expected to go mass production in 2021.\n31\nThe table below sets forth the features of our products for large-sized applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers • 384 to 1920 output channels\n• 6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16 million colors) or 10-bit (1 billion\ncolors)\n• one gamma-type driver\n• two gamma-type drivers to improve display quality\n• three gamma-type drivers (RGB independent gamma curve to\nenhance color image)\n• output driving voltage ranging from 7 up to 20V\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\nand support half VDDA\n• low power consumption and low EMI\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS (up to 400MHz), cascade\nmodulated driver interface, or CMDI, point-to-point high speed\ninterface (up to 4Gbps for 8K 120Hz) and customized interface\ntechnologies\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers • 192 to 1600 output channels\n• output driving voltage ranging from 10 up to 50v\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n• low power consumption\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\nTiming Controllers • product portfolio supports a wide range of resolutions, from VGA\n(640 x 480 pixels) to full HD, UHD and 8K4K (1,920 x 1,080 pixels,\n1,920 x 1,200 pixels, 3840 x 2160 and 7680 x 4320)\n• support mini-LVDS, point-to-point high speed interface and\ncustomized output interface technologies\n• embedded overdrive function to improve response time\n• support CABC and local dimming to save power and color engine to\nenhance color and sharpness\n• support TTL, LVDS, eDP, G-sync, MIPI and V-by-one input\ninterface technologies\n• support dual-gate, triple-gate, GOA (gate on array) and RGBW panel\ndesigns\n• support amorphous silicon, IGZO and LTPS panel\n• ASIC AMOLED timing controller\nProgrammable Gamma OP • 8 to 16 channel gamma buffer outputs\n• channel VCOM buffer output\n• Internal non-volatile memory\n• 2 gamma bank selection, setting time < 3uS\n• Analog power supply voltage: 9.0V to 20.0V\n• Digital power supply voltage: 2.7V to 3.6V\n• Peak current on gamma channels: 200mA\n• Peak current on VCOM channel: 400mA\n• Programmable VCOM limit\n• 12C speed up to 1MHz\n32\nElectronic Paper Display Applications\nWe offer display driver for the Electronic Paper Display (EPD) applications, such as reading & writing\ndevice, Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) and Signage Display.

This has also contributed to increased demand for larger size and higher\nresolution smartphone displays. In the past few years, we offered innovative handset display driver products by\nproviding FWVGA (480 x 864), qHD (540 x 960), WSVGA (1024 x 600), HD720 (720 x 1280)/ WXGA (800 x\n1280), FHD (1080 x 1920) / WUXGA (1200 x 1920) and up to QHD (1440 x 2560) / WQXGA (1600x2560) display\ndriver ICs. We continue to update new products for this mainstream smartphone and tablet with lower cost and new\nfeatures, such as color enhancement and sun-light readability enhancement functions. In 2015, we developed new\ntechnologies and led the display industry with next generation display driver ICs, such as a-si FHD (1080 x 1920),\nAMOLED ASICs for HD and FHD and LTPS QHD (1440 x 2560) with sub-pixel rendering technologies. In 2016,\nHimax developed a series of single chip touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch\ndisplay panel. Himax started the shipments of in-cell TDDI for some smartphones in 2016 and extended TDDI\nsolution to tablet application in 2017. Smartphone display had a dramatic change in terms of aspect ratio, instead\nof resolution, in 2017. Though display resolution of entry smartphones kept moving up from WVGA or qHD to\nHD, high-end smartphone display may be stuck at FHD or QHD since it’s pixel per inch is good enough for normal\nconsumers’ daily use. OEMs start to seek for differentiation with 18:9 or even wider aspect ratio, full front displays.\nHimax has designed conventional 16:9 HD and FHD DDICs capable of supporting 18:9 or wider HD+/FHD+\ndisplays and achieved a number of design-wins with leading Chinese smartphone brands. As in-cell TDDI, featuring\nthinner display, slimmer border, and better visual quality, has been getting popular, we re-invented a new generation\nof TDDIs supporting COG and COF for 18:9 or wider aspect ratio with interlaced output pins, which makes the\nbottom border of the in-cell touch display even smaller to gain higher display to body ratio. Our FHD+ and HD+\nTDDI successfully gained design-wins with a few leading Korean and Chinese smartphone brands and panel makers.\n33\nWe started small volume shipment in the first half of 2018 with accelerating volume started in the second half of\n2018 into 2019 and beyond. In 2020, Himax extended our product offerings with high frame rate TDDI solution\nand has started shipping to top-tier smartphone OEMs. We expect the demand for high frame rate TDDI solution\nto explode as more brands adopt this feature in display.\nA major development we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the OLED display for\nsmartphone, smart watch, automotive and tablet. This is due to investments on expanded AMOLED capacity as\nwell as increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED display\nfor the time being. We are collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China for AMOLED product\ndevelopment. We believe AMOLED driver ICs will soon become one of the major growth engines for our small\npanel driver IC business.\nOn the other hand, the application of in-cell TDDI start to extend from mainstream smartphone to larger\ndisplays in 2018. Himax started to offer various new TDDI solutions for tablet, smart speakers, and even some\ninfotainment displays in automobiles. The first tablet TDDI with WXGA resolution went mass production in\n2018 and also extended to leading smart speaker applications as well. In 2019, Himax announced a series of new\ndriver and TDDIs for tablet application. The COF packaged driver IC solution enables one leading tablet OEM\nsuccessfully launching WQXGA resolution tablet with super slim bezel. We also added another new features to\nour TDDI that can support up to WUXGA and WQXGA resolution has gained several design-win from tablet\nOEMs across Korea and China in 2019. We also launched the first TDDI supporting active stylus function in\ntablets which commenced mass production and contribute to our tablet application business in 2020.\nTablet in-cell TDDI offers the benefits of lower cost and a simplified supply chain that represents an easier\nmanufacturing process for panel makers. For consumers, it offers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish\ndesign as well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus. Our active stylus in-cell technology\nis adopted in many launched tablet products. At present, we are the dominant supplier for literally all leading\nAndroid names. In 2020, tablet demand is picking up significantly fueled mainly by remote work and online\nlearning demand due to the pandemic. TDDI for tablet application represents a tremendous upside for Himax\nthrough 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our products for smartphone and tablet applications:\nProduct Features\nSmartphone Display Drivers • highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, gate\ndriver, power circuit, timing controller and memory\n• suitable for a wide range of resolutions from QQVGA (128 x 160\npixels) to QHD (1440 x 2560 pixels)\n• support up to 16 million colors\n• support RGB separated gamma adjustment\n• support CABC\n• support color enhancement features including saturation, brightness,\nand sharpness enhancement\n• support MIPI interface for smartphone application and LVDS for CE\napplications\n• support RAM-less or 1/3 RAM compression technologies\n• low power consumption and low EMI\n• fewer external components to reduce costs\n• slimmer die for compact module to fit smaller smartphone designs\n• application specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, can be designed to\nmeet customized requirements for LCD or AMOLED\n• touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell\ntouch display\n• extending from 16:9 to 18:9 or wider aspect ratio\n• COG and COF solutions for super slim bottom border\n• Conventional 60Hz and up to 144Hz new high frame rate solution\n• AMOLED driver IC with sub-pixel rendering, Demura-IPs for FHD+\nTablet Display Drivers • highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver, power\ncircuit, and timing controller\n• suitable for a wide range of resolutions from WSVGA (600 x 1024),\nWXGA (800 x 1280), WUXGA (1200x1920) to WQXGA (1600 x 2560)\n34\n• support up to 16 million colors\n• support RGB separated gamma adjustment\n• support CABC\n• support color enhancement features\n• support MIPI interface\n• touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell\ntouch display\n• supporting TDDI with active stylus\n• COG and COF solutions for super slim bezel\nAutomotive Display Applications\nWe offer source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers and integrated drivers for the fast ramping automotive\ndisplay applications, such as instrument cluster display (ICD), center information display (CID), head-up display\n(HUD), rear seat entertainment display (RSE) and rearview mirror display.\nThe automotive display drivers can support various display resolutions to meet the customized needs of\nautomotive display, including GIP panel and non-GIP panel, a-Si TFT panel and LTPS panel.

The main products\nare Power Managements ICs (PMIC), Programmable Gamma OP ICs (PGOP) and Level Shifter ICs (LS). In\nrecent years, PMIC/PGOP/LS 3-in-1 PMIC has gradually become the mainstream solution.\nPower Management ICs\nA power management IC integrates several power components to fulfill system power requirements. It may\ninclude step-up or step-down pulse width modulation, or PWM, DC-to-DC converters, low-dropout regulators, or\nLDO regulators, voltage detectors, operational amplifiers, p-gamma OP, level shifters, and/or other components.\nFor panel module applications, a power management IC provides a reliable and precise voltage for source\ndrivers, gate drivers, timing controllers, and panel cells. Moreover, its built-in over-temperature and over-current\nprotections help prevent components from being damaged under certain abnormal conditions. As integrating an\nincreasing number of components into a power management IC is likely to be a continuing trend, we believe\npower management ICs will continue to be critical components of a TFT-LCD panel module. The following table\nsummarizes certain features of our power management IC products:\nProduct Features\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • built-in power MOSFET\nSolutions for Notebooks • step-up PWM converter\n• charge pump regulator\n• LDO regulator\n• voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n• Vcom operational amplifier\n• 2ch programmable gamma voltage with operational amplifier\n• I2C programmable\n• low frame rate control for power saving solution\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • PMIC/PGOP/Level Shifter 3-in-1\nSolutions for Monitors • built-in power MOSFET\n• step-up PWM converter\n• HV LDO regulator\n• voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n• programmable Vcom voltage / Vcom operational amplifier\n• programmable gamma voltage with operational amplifier\n• level shifter\nIntegrated Multi-Channel Power • PMIC/PGOP/Level Shifter 3-in-1\nSolutions for TVs • built-in power MOSFET\n• step-up PWM converter\n• step-down PWM converter\n• charge pump regulator\n• HV LDO regulator\n• voltage detector\n• gate pulse modulator\n38\nProduct Features\n• Vcom operational amplifier\n• I2C programmable\n• level shifter\n• programmable gamma voltage with operational amplifier\nProgrammable Gamma OP ICs\nIt is a Programmable Gamma, DVR and VCOM IC.

All level shifter\nchannels feature the same input circuitry and are compatible with the standard logic-level signals generated by\ntiming controllers in typical applications. The level shifter converts the timing-controller (TCON) logic-level\nsignals to the high-level signals needed by the GOA (gate on array) display. The output circuitry has been designed\nto achieve high rise and fall times when driving the capacitive loads typically encountered in TFT-LCD display\napplications.\nProduct Features\n16- channel level shifter for dual gate • support two kinds of T-con input signals\nGOA TFT-LCD • 6/8/10 clock channel output\n• 2 channel STV\n• 2 channel LC\n• 2 discharge channels\n• support charge sharing function\n• reset function\n• OTP/OCP (detect level, time and count) with I2C adjustment\n• Support 2 input and 6/8/10 output\nLED driver\nA light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that is widely used in lighting, display and TFT\nLCD backlight nowadays. The advantages of LEDs as light sources are the small size, fast switching, low power\nconsumption and long lifetime etc.\nLED driver IC is designed to dim the LEDs with critical features such as high current accuracy, high current\nmatching, short LED protection, open LED protection, over voltage protection, ghosting effect reduction and\ncurrent sink leakage protection etc.\nProduct Features\nCustomer ASIC • By Customer Specification\n39\nCMOS Image Sensor Products\nThe CMOS image sensor products are developed by our subsidiary, Himax Imaging. The products were\ndesigned firstly for camera-equipped mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and notebook computers, with\na focus on low light image and video quality. Although it seems relatively challenging for us to gain significant\nmarket share in conventional RGB camera, we do think there are various interesting and different applications in\nimaging. Based on the technologies and IP we developed, on top of legacy products for laptop and multimedia\nwe have been supplying, our product lines have been expanded to cover three domains: ultralow power computer\nvision- Always-On Sensor (“AoS”), Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, and big pixel BSI sensors in automotive and\nsurveillance. In 2019, we further prioritized our focus on ultralow power computer vision- Always-On Sensor\n(“AoS”) as the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing. Together\nwith the technologies we already developed, such as Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, we can provide our customers\nthe best integrated solutions for several specific domains.\nIn addition to advancing our AoS sensor to drive the power as low as possible, we also devote ourselves to\ndeveloping sensors that have industry leading small pixel (1.12um) with higher near infrared Quantum Efficiency\n(“QE”) to support the new generation cameras. Their superior performance hugely helps to reduce the system’s\npower consumption and therefore enhances the system performance. With the high QE in NIR band, we open the\ndoors to building more sensor and camera systems for machine vision. For example, our HM11B1 is a critical part\nof Himax’s WiseEye solution, an AI-based ultralow power smart sensing total solution and has penetrated into\nthe laptop ecosystem for the most stylish super slim bezel design. Given its slim (narrower than 2mm) dimension\nto support ultra-thin bezel, we combine original RGB video conference sensor, IR sensor originally for Windows\nHello support, and newly added intelligent AoS sensor into a single silicon. This 3-in-1 sensor not only enables\nnew features, but also hugely saves laptop makers’ effort in mechanical design and overall cost.\nWe are committed to be a key player in the CMOS image sensor business with continuous investment in\nexperienced human resources, an efficient supply chain as well as strategic technology developments and\npartnerships to further increase the performance and improve features of small and specially designed pixel\nsensors.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our CMOS image sensor products:\nProduct Features\n5MP UltraSense 2 NIR Sensor • 1/2.6”

Level Optics Products\nWafer level optics are optical products manufactured using semiconductor process on wafers. This innovative\napproach enables wafer level optics to manufacture micro/nano optics structure and high temperature resistance,\nmaking the compatible Surface-Mount Technology or SMT reflow process possible. We offer entire optical\nsolutions for customers who need compact and easy-to-handle optical products on their electronic devices.\nCombining traditional optical lens design, precise mold control and semiconductor manufacturing expertise,\nour WLO lens with integrated waveguide, refractive optics and diffractive optical element (DOE) is one of the best\nsolution for next generation computational imaging module for 2D/3D illumination and 3D dot projector, which\ncan be applied to 3D face recognition, 3D sensing, 3D reconstruction, and gesture control. With the innovative\nprocess and specific structure, our wafer level optics products provide small form factor and compact module size\nto be easily integrated into consumer products such as smartphones, AR/VR devices, and other mobile devices.\nOur WLO technology is also adapted to form microstructure such as lens array, DOE and lenticular lens for\nadvanced applications in digital and computational imaging fields. These technologies stand in a unique position\nto integral optical design, semiconductor manufacturing process, and compact packaging service, which are\nrarely covered by one single company. Deeply rooted in core wafer level optics technologies, we provide highly\ncustomized optical solutions and high-volume manufacturing to many tier-one customers such as structured\nlighted and ToF 3D sensing on mobile device, AR/VR gadgets, biomedical devices and other applications.\nOur WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer.\nThe overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption\nin more models. In 2019, we continued the strong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill anchor customer’s\nhigher demand with a significant year-over-year increase. In 2020, we continued our shipment to anchor customer\nfor their legacy product. We continue to make progress with ongoing R&D projects with world-leading high\ntech giants for next generation products in various AR/VR, ToF and LiDAR applications centered around our\nexceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our wafer level optics products:\n42\nProduct Features\nRefractive Optical Lens • for Micro Lens Array (MLA) illumination diffuser, lighting control,\nflux illumination lens, collimation lens, and compact size camera lens\n• provide multi-layer solution including optical AR coating,\nIR-cutting filter coating, aspheric surface\n• double-side manufacture process\n• already in mass production\nDiffractive Optical Element (DOE) • computational imaging, flux illumination, dot projector for 3D\nsensing, 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE and refractive lens\n• provide customized solution for specific application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nDiffuser element for flood • using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE technology\nillumination and TOF • the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nNear Infrared (NIR) Projector • dot projector module solution for computer vision, 3D sensing, 3D\nModule reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• integral NIR Laser (830/850/940nm), optical system (refractive+\ndiffractive lens) and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution to provide the smallest form factor\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• provide customized module solution for different application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\nFlood illumination Module • provide customized solution for specific application integral NIR\nLaser (830/850/940nm), and high precise active alignment assembly\nsolution\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n3D Sensing Business\nWe continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing\nprojects. In 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing total solution targeting Android smartphone’s front-\nfacing application was unsuccessful due to the high hardware cost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time\nrequired to integrate it into the smartphone and the lack of killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and\nonline payment. Instead of 3D sensing, most of the Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost fingerprint\ntechnology which can achieve similar phone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised\nuser experience.\nBeing a leading provider of 3D sensing technology, Himax is also an active participant in smartphone OEMs’\ndesign projects for new devices involving ToF technology. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone\nmakers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D depth\ninformation generation for AR. Unlike structured light 3D sensing where we provide total solution or just projector\nmodule or optics depending on customers’ needs, with ToF, we will only focus on transmitter module or optics\ncomponent by leveraging our WLO related expertise. In the past few months, we have been actively working with\nindustry leading VCSEL provider, sensor company, module manufactures and smartphone makers for a new and\nadvanced ToF 3D solution development, targeting Android smartphones. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we\nhave made great progress providing the partner with spot projector or optics component for their reference design\nwhich is ready under leading Android smartphone makers’ evaluation.\n43\nAs we reported at second quarter 2019 earnings call on August 7, we had adjusted our structured light-based\n3D sensing technology development to focus on applications for non-smartphone segments which are typically less\nsensitive to cost and always require a total solution.\n3D sensing can have a wide range of applications beyond smartphone. We have started to explore business\nopportunities in various industries by leveraging our structured light 3D sensing total solution. We expect small\nvolume shipments for business access control and biomedical inspection devices in the first quarter 2021. With\nmore design-ins and engagements currently under progress, we continue to receive numerous inquiries with new\nideas of applications that never occurred to us. To strengthen our offers in 3D sensing total solution, we have been\ncollaborating closely mainly with two types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial recognition\nalgorithm and those offering application processors with strong AI capability.\nOther than 3D sensing total solution, we provide key component, our proprietary 3D decoder IC, to customers\nwho wish to design their own structured light-based 3D sensing solution. It is now well-adopted by many China\ne-payment solution providers and entered into small volume production in 2020. Our 3D decoder can accelerate\nlocal image processing for face recognition and offer best-in-class security authentication. It was already certified by\nthe leading Chinese electronic payment standard with requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation and\nstrict privacy.\nOur critical 3D sensing Technologies include the followings.\nWafer Level Optics Products\nWLO is one of the key technologies enabling 3D sensing, AR goggle devices, and many other applications.\nLevering on our exceptional design know-how and mass production experience in WLO technology, we are able to\nproduce the world’s most compact optics required for 3D sensing, meanwhile achieving superior performance and\nlower costs.\nASIC\nOne of the critical elements of our 3D sensing total solution is an ASIC for 3D depth map generation. We are able\nto develop the ASIC thanks to our unique in-house capability in developing video ASICs for customers. Equipped\nwith the ASIC, our 3D sensing total solution can substantially reduce the power consumed while processing 3D\nsensing, enhance personal data security, accelerate the 3D depth map generation, and provide superior depth data\noutput that matches with our optical component. We consider this unique capability as our competitive advantage. It\nhas been and will continue to be one of our key drivers in the success of our 3D sensing total solution.\nActive Alignment\nWith much experience in optical assembly for AR and VR devices, our factory has developed a system to do\nactive alignment for tiny components. From the incoming quality check, assembly process, and testing, all steps\nare monitored and checked. The precision assembly capability gives us a very good foundation to do the optical\nassembly for DOE, WLO, and laser.\nLaser Driver\nBased on our expertise in projector, optics, and driver, we have designed a special Glass Broken Detection\n(“GBD”) mechanism on our projector. With the support from laser driver, it can cease the laser to prevent users from\nbeing exposed to higher power laser energy.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our SLiM 3D sensing total solutions:\nProduct Features\nSLiM 3D sensing total solution • Dot projector: More than 33,000 invisible dots, the highest in the\nindustry, projected onto object to build the most sophisticated 3D\ndepth map among all structured light solutions\n• Depth map accuracy: Error rate of < 0.5% within the entire\noperation range of 30cm-100cm\n• Face recognition: Enabled by the most sophisticated 3D depth data\n44\nto build unique facial map that can be used for instant unlock and\nsecure online payment\n• Indoor/outdoor sensitivity: Superior sensing capability even under\ntotal darkness or bright sunlight\n• Eye safety: Certified for IEC 60825 Class 1, the international laser\nproduct standard which governs laser product safety under all\nconditions of normal use with naked eyes\n• Glass broken detection: Patented glass broken detection mechanism\nin the dot projector whereby laser is shut down instantaneously in\nthe event of broken glass in the projector\n• Power consumption: Less than 400mW for projector, sensor and\ndepth decoding combined, making it the lowest power consuming\n3D sensing device by far among all structured light solutions\n• Module size: the smallest structured light solution in the market,\nideal for embedded and mobile device integration\nHV-II 3D Decoder ASIC • Himax 3D Depth Processor with high depth accuracy\n• Support up to HD resolution depth map for different applications\n• 2D & 3D auto-exposure control for projector and sensor\n• Frame rate conversion for different application/capability of SOC\n• Scaling engine for different application/capability of SOC\n• Ambient light detection and removal\n• Embedded Security Engine\n• Power Management Engine for power shutdown\n• MIPI CSI-2 / DPHY interfaceframework.

WE-I Plus AI processor adopted Google TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers\nframework from June 2020 and has successfully demonstrated our unrivaled computing capability with\nultralow power. In December 2020, we partnered with SparkFun, an online retail store, to distribute Himax\nWE-I Plus Edge AI evaluation board and AoS sensor modules. Developers can now access our technologies\neasily from SparkFun and transform their AI-enabling concepts which call for ultralow power and computer\nvision AI into real products. Furthermore, we teamed up with Edge Impulse who provides a leading end-\nto-end AI developer platform offering intuitive user interface. On Edge Impulse’s platform, with a single\nbutton press and within seconds, developers can now generate the latest neural network AI model and export\nit directly onto the WE-I Plus evaluation board. The high technical obstacles developers usually face can\ntherefore be dramatically lowered. Meanwhile, we also are working with another leading cloud service AI\nproviders to adopt their edge-to-cloud service ecosystem with a business focus more toward healthcare,\nfinancial services, government, retail and industrial manufacturing.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our WiseEye WE-I Plus ASIC product:\nProduct Features\nWiseEye® WE-I Plus ASIC • Ultralow power consumption: 40 uW/MHz\n• Support image, voice trigger simultaneously to wake up system\n• Optimized multi-layer power states for always-on applications\n• Ready-for- use software package and Machine Learning Library,\nincluding device driver, SDK and embARC Machine Learning\nInference Library to support Google TensorFlow Lite Micro framework\n• ARC-EM9D 32-bit DSP: Frequency up to 400MHz,\n• Memory: Up to 2MByte SRAM\n• High performance pixel processing accelerator and JPEG codec\n• Security Engine: Support secure boot, secure FW update, secure\ndebug mode, Support AES 128bits, RSA 2048bits, Hash-256,\nTRNG, Secure key management\n• Peripheral: 1/4/8-bit camera interface, I2C/SPI master/slave,\nUART, PWM, GPIO with 5 wake-up pins, 12-bit ADC with 4\nchannels, up to 1Msps, RTC Timer\nCore Technologies and Know-How\nDriving System Technology. Through our collaboration with panel manufacturers, we have developed extensive\nknowledge of circuit design, TFT-LCD driving systems, high-voltage CMOS processes and display systems,\nall of which are important to the design of high-performance TFT-LCD display drivers. Our engineers have in-\ndepth knowledge of the driving system technology, which is the architecture for the interaction between the source\ndriver, gate driver, timing controller and power systems as well as other passive components. We believe that\nour understanding of the entire driving system has strengthened our design capabilities. Our engineers are highly\nskilled in designing power efficient and compact display drivers that enhance the performance of TFT-LCD. We are\nleveraging our know-how of display drivers and driving system technology to develop display drivers for panels\nutilizing other technologies such as OLED.\nHigh-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design. Unlike most other semiconductors, TFT-LCD display drivers require a\nhigh output voltage of 3.3 to 50 volts. We have developed circuit design technologies using a high-voltage CMOS\nprocess that enables us to produce high-yield, reliable and compact drivers for high-volume applications. Moreover,\nour technologies enable us to keep the driving voltage at very high uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve\nwhen using standard CMOS process technology.\n46\n3D Technologies. Several technologies in Himax are integrated together to form our 3D solution. First, wafer\nlevel imprinted technology is used to design and manufacture DOE and WLO. Then, our in-house capability on\nsemiconductor enable us to design IC particularly match our optical component. Our expertise in precision assembly\nin optics also help us to provide a more complete solution to our customers.\nSmart Sensing Technologies. Composed by an AoS sensor, an edge ASIC processor and computer-vision AI\nalgorithm, all operated in ultralow power mode. Our industrial first AoS CMOS image sensor features ultralow\npower and low latency back-illuminated solution for always on, intelligent visual sensing applications. With Himax\nexceptional low power know-how and ASIC implementation technologies, AI processor featured different power\ndomain and mode management schemes, together with advanced image processing hardwired accelerators to\nconstruct different operating modes in balancing processor performance and power consumptions. The seamless and\nproprietary interface between our AoS sensor and AI processor ensure the efficient and fast-response sensor data\ntransmission and wake-up mechanism operating in ultralow power mode. The computer-vision AI algorithm, which\nget benefit from high performance and low power AI processor and image data from sensor, can therefore enable AI\nfeatures such as powerful human detection, occupancy detection and motion classification for various application\nneeds.\nHigh-Bandwidth Interfaces. In addition to high-voltage circuit design, TFT-LCD display drivers require high\nbandwidth transmission for video signals. We have applied several high-speed interfaces, including transistor-\ntransistor logic (“TTL”), Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), mini low-voltage differential signaling\n(“LVDS”), dual-edge TTL (“DETTL”), turbo Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), Mobile Industry\nProcessor Interface (“MIPI”) and other customized interfaces in our display drivers. Moreover, we are developing\nadditional driver interfaces for special applications with optimized speed, lower EMI and higher system stability.\nDie Shrink and LowPower Technologies. Our engineers are highly skilled in employing their knowledge\nof driving technology and high-voltage CMOS circuit design to shrink the die size of our display drivers while\nleveraging their understanding of driving technology and panel characteristics to design display drivers with low\npower consumption. Die size is an important consideration for applications with size constraints. Smaller die size\nalso reduces the cost of the chip. Lower power consumption is important for many portable devices such as notebook\ncomputers, smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products.\nCustomers\nOur customers for display drivers are primarily panel manufacturers and mobile device module manufacturers,\nwho in turn design and market their products to manufacturers of end-use products such as notebook computers,\ndesktop monitors, televisions, smartphone, tablet, automotive and consumer electronics products. We may sell our\nproducts through agents or distributors for certain products or in certain regions. As of December 31, 2020, we sold\nour products to more than 200 customers. Our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 74.6%,\n75.6% and 77.7% of our revenues in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, our three largest\ncustomers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue: customer A and its affiliates accounted for 28.1%, 29.5%\nand 32.6% of our revenues, respectively; customer B and its affiliates accounted for 12.6%, 8.9% and 6.6% of our\nrevenues, respectively; and customer C accounted for 5.7%, 5.6% and 12.7%, respectively.\nCertain of our customers provide us with a long-term (twelve-month) forecast plus three-month rolling\nnon-binding forecasts and confirm orders about one month ahead of scheduled delivery. In general, purchase orders\nare not cancellable by either party, although from time to time we and our customers have agreed to amend the terms\nof such orders.\nSales and Marketing\nWe focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology relationships principally\nwith TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, panel manufacturers using LTPS or OLED, or Oxide technologies, mobile\ndisplay module and mobile device manufacturers for smartphone, tablet and automotive, and camera module\nhouses in order to work closely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product\nroad maps. Our engineers collaborate with our customers’ engineers to create products that comply with their\nspecifications and provide a high level of performance at competitive prices and also create customized features for\nend brand customers. Our end market for large-sized panels is concentrated among a limited number of major panel\nmanufacturers. We also market our products directly to monitor, notebook and mobile device manufacturers so that\n47\nour products can be qualified for their specifications and designed into their products. Furthermore, we extend\nour business development with system and ODM companies by using strategic ASIC business model to not only\ndevelop ASIC product based on customer specification but also jointly research and develop new technologies to\nmeet customers' future product demand. Additionally, we form strategic partnership with tier-1 customers for our\nLCOS microdisplays, 3D sensing and smart sensing to penetrate into the emerging market. We believe we need close\nalliance with our customers to build up ecosystem for new applications.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales teams located in Taiwan, China, South Korea and Japan.\nWe also have dedicated sales teams for certain of our most important current or prospective customers. We have\noffices in Tainan, Hsinchu, Taipei, Taiwan; and Shenzen and Suzhou, China. We have other sales and technical\nsupport offices in Hefei, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Foshan, Fuqing, Ningbo, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu,\nXi’an and Xiamen, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South Korea; Givatayim, Israel; and Irvine\nand Campbell, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, all in close proximity to our customers. For certain\nproducts or regions, we may sell our products through agents or distributors.\nOur sales and marketing team possesses a high level of technical expertise and industry knowledge used to\nsupport a lengthy and complex sales process. This includes a highly trained team of product managers and field\napplications engineers. Our team is equipped with extensive strategic marketing experience and a strong capability\nto identify market trends. We also provide technical support and assistance to potential and existing customers in\nsystem/SoC architecture, designing, testing and qualifying display modules, camera modules and end application\nsystems that incorporate our products and ASICs. We believe that the depth and quality of this design support are\nkey to improving customers’ time-to-market and maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.\nManufacturing\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely on semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication, gold bumping,\nassembly and testing. We also rely largely on third-party suppliers of processed tape used in TAB packaging. We\nengage foundries with high-voltage CMOS process technology for our display drivers and engage assembly and\ntesting houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages, thereby taking advantage of the economies of scale and\nthe specialization of such semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to\ncapture certain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures,\nfixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the\nmost suitable for any given product.\nWe operate a fab under Himax Display primarily for performing manufacturing processes for our LCOS\nmicrodisplays. Moreover, for better integration, we also established an in-house color filter facility under Himax\nTaiwan, which commenced shipments from 2010. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our\nproprietary single-panel color LCOS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness\nof our LCOS products and creates value for our customers. In addition, we have established an in-house WLO\nfacility under Himax Taiwan for the key process of our wafer level optics products, which started small-scale\nshipments from December 2009 and commenced mass shipment to anchor customer from 2017 onwards. We began\nconstruction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the current headquarters to house additional\nWLO capacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our 3D sensing business and to provide extra office\nspace. The construction of Fab 2 was completed in the first half of 2018.\nManufacturing Stages\nThe diagram below sets forth the various stages in manufacturing display drivers according to the two different\ntypes of assembly utilized: TAB or COG. The assembly type depends primarily on the application and design of the\npanel and is determined by our customers.\n48\nWafer Fabrication: Based on our design, the foundry provides us with fabricated wafers. Each fabricated wafer\ncontains many chips, each known as a die.\nGold Bumping: After the wafers are fabricated, they are delivered to gold bumping houses where gold bumps\nare plated on each wafer. The gold bumping process uses thin film metal deposition, photolithography and\nelectrical plating technologies. The gold bumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die to the processed\ntape, in the case of TAB package, or the glass, in the case of COG package.\nChip Probe Testing: Each die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded.\nAssembly and Testing: Our display drivers use two types of assembly technology: TAB or COG. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and to a lesser extent COG package\ntypes,whereas display drivers for smartphone, tablet and consumer electronics products typically require COG\npackage types.\nTAB Assembly\nWe use two types of TAB technologies: TCP and COF. TCP and COF packages are both made of processed\ntape that is typically 35mm or 48mm wide, plated with copper foil and has a circuit formed within it. TCP and\nCOF packages differ, however, in terms of their chip connections. With TCP packages, a hole is punched through\nthe processed tape in the area of the chip, which is connected to a flying lead made of copper. By contrast, with\nCOF packages, the lead is mounted directly on the processed tape and there is no flying lead. In recent years, COF\npackages have become predominantly used in TAB technology.\n• Inner-Lead Bonding: The TCP and COF assembly process involves grinding the bumped wafers into their\nrequired thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies, or chips. An inner lead bonder machine connects\nthe chip to the printed circuit processed tape and the package is sealed with resin at high temperatures.\n• Final Testing: The assembled display drivers are tested to ensure that they meet performance specifications.\nTesting takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each product.\n49\nCOG Assembly\nCOG assembly connects display drivers directly to LCD panels without the need for processed tape. COG\nassembly involves grinding the tested wafers into their required thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies,\nor chips. Each individual die is picked and placed into a chip tray and is then visually or auto-inspected for defects.\nThe dies are packed within a tray in an aluminum bag after completion of the inspection process.\nQuality Assurance\nWe maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system. Using a variety of methods, from conducting rigorous\nsimulations during the circuit design process to evaluating supplier performance at various stages of our products’\nmanufacturing process, we seek to bring about improvements and achieve customer satisfaction. In addition to\nmonitoring customer satisfaction through regular reviews, we implement extensive supplier quality controls so that\nthe products we outsource achieve our high standards. Prior to engaging a third party as our supplier, we perform\na series of audits on their operations, and upon engagement, we hold frequent quality assurance meetings with\nour suppliers to evaluate such factors as product quality, production costs, technological sophistication and timely\ndelivery.\nIn November 2002, we received ISO 9001 certification, which was renewed in March 2018 and will expire in\nMarch 2021. In February 2006, we received ISO 14001 certification, which was renewed in December 2017 and\nwill expire in December 2020. In addition, in March 2007, we received IECQ QC 080000 certification, which was\nrenewed in February 2019 and will expire in March 2022.\nEnvironmental Management System and Safety and Health Management System\nHimax follows closely the global environmental trends, including energy saving and waste reduction, in its daily\noperations. The Company is certified in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14064.\nHimax is a leader in its sector when it comes to the environment and safety, operating under measures much\nmore stringent than domestic regulations. The Company aims to grow sustainably, delivering economic, social and\nenvironmental benefits with its healthy employees.\nHimax has also been tirelessly reducing impacts to the environment and improving safety in its operations,\nspecifically targeting product design and waste handling.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Service Providers and Suppliers\nThrough our relationships with leading foundries, assembly, gold bumping and testing houses and processed\ntape suppliers, we believe we have established a supply chain that enables us to deliver high-quality products to our\ncustomers in a timely manner.\nAccess to semiconductor manufacturing service providers is critical as display drivers require high-voltage\nCMOS process technology and specialized assembly and testing services, all of which are different from industry\nstandards. We have obtained our foundry services from TSMC, Vanguard, Macronix, Globalfoundries Singapore\nand PSMC in the past few years and have also established relationships with UMC, Nexchip and SKHYSI. These\nare among a select number of semiconductor manufacturers that provide high-voltage CMOS process technology\nrequired for manufacturing display drivers. We engage assembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG\npackages such as Chipbond, Chipmore International trading company Ltd., ChipMOS Technologies Inc., Nepes\nCorporation and King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd.\nWe plan to strengthen our relationships with our existing semiconductor manufacturing service providers and diversify\nour network of such service providers in order to ensure access to sufficient cost-competitive and high-quality manufacturing\ncapacity. We are selective in our choice of semiconductor manufacturing service providers. It takes a substantial amount of\ntime to qualify alternative foundries, gold bumping, assembly and testing houses for production. As a result, we expect that\nwe will continue to rely on a limited number of semiconductor manufacturing service providers for a substantial portion of\nour manufacturing requirements in the near future.\n50\nThe table below sets forth (in alphabetical order) our principal semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders and suppliers:\nWafer Fabrication Gold Bumping\nGlobalfoundries Singapore Pte., Ltd.

We must, among other things,\ncontinue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product portfolio, maintain our leading technology\nposition, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate declining average selling\nprices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover, we must continue to address\nthe challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and retaining managerial, engineering,\noperational and financial personnel and implementing and improving our existing administrative, financial and\noperations systems.\n55\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and assembly\nand testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-performance\nsemiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer fabrication,\ngold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCOS microdisplay, wafer level optics\nproducts and active alignment for 3D sensing, which we manufacture through our own factories. We are able to take\nadvantage of the economies of scale and the specialization of our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture certain financial and operational benefits, including\nreduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to\nuse the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given product. For LCOS microdisplay\nand wafer level optics products, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies and\nmanufacturing expertise in the effort to further expand these businesses.\nAs our semiconductors are critical components of flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the trends\nand developments of the flat panel display industry, in particular, the TFT-LCD panel segment. The majority of our\nrevenues in 2020 were derived from sales of display drivers that were eventually incorporated into TFT-LCD panels.\nWe expect display drivers for TFT-LCD panels to continue to be our primary products. The TFT-LCD panel industry\nis intensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD\npanels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in downward pricing pressure on our products.\nSee “Item 3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business—We\nderive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical and\nsubject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business or results\nof operations.” The revenue expansion of our non-driver products as well as TFT-LCD product trending toward high\nresolution and any other new product introduction help to mitigate these risks.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur business, financial position and results of operations, as well as the period-to-period comparability of our\nfinancial results, are significantly affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n• average selling prices;\n• unit shipments;\n• product mix;\n• design wins;\n• cost of revenues and cost reductions;\n• supply chain management;\n• share-based compensation expenses; and\n• tax credits.\nAverage Selling Prices\nOur performance is affected by the selling prices of each of our products. We price our products based on\nseveral factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage of the product, competition, technical complexity of\nthe product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer. We typically are able to charge the\nhighest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are able to raise our selling\nprices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline over a product’s life cycle,\nwhich may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such as constraints in foundry capacity.\nFor example, in 2020, the industry-wide tightening of foundry capacity has extended to backend facilities that\ninclude assembly and testing and appears to be a long-term phenomenon. Robust demand pushed foundry capacity\nconstraints to a more severe level and rose higher material cost which in turn enabled higher average selling prices.\nThe general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling prices of semiconductors to decline\nover a product’s life cycle due to competition, production efficiencies, emergence of substitutes and technological\nobsolescence. Our cost reduction efforts also contribute to this decline in average selling prices. See “—Cost of\nRevenues and Cost Reductions.”\n56\nOur average selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. As new China panel\nmakers emerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their capacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will\nincrease accordingly, negatively impacting our average selling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by\nthe packaging type our customers choose as well as the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below.\nLastly, competition level affects our average selling prices as well. However, the impact of declining average selling\nprices on our profitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent by increased volume as lower prices may\nstimulate demand and thereby drive sales and TFT-LCD panel products trending toward higher resolution.\nUnit Shipments\nOur performance is also affected by the number of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As our display\ndrivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our unit shipments depend primarily on our customers’\npanel shipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since our inception primarily as a result\nof our increased market share with certain major customers and their increased shipments of panels. Our growth\nin unit shipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels which typically require more display\ndrivers. However, the development of higher channel display drivers or new technologies, if successful, could\npotentially reduce the number of display drivers required for each panel while achieving the same resolution. If\nsuch technologies become commercially available, the market for our display drivers will be reduced and we could\nexperience a decline in revenue and profit. Our unit shipments also depend on the capacity we can get from our\nfoundry, assembly and testing house. Our growth was constrained by the severe foundry capacity shortage in 2020.\nProduct Mix\nThe proportion of our revenues that is generated from the sale of different product types, also referred to as\nproduct mix, also affects our average selling prices, revenues and profitability. Our display driver products vary\ndepending on, among other things, the number of output channels, the level of integration and the package type.\nVariations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices of such products. For example,\nthe trend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products with a higher number of channels,\nwhich typically command higher average selling prices than traditional products with a lower number of channels.\nHowever, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically require fewer display drivers per panel. As a result,\nour profitability will be adversely affected to the extent that the decrease in the number of display drivers required\nfor each panel is not offset by increased total unit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers\nwith a higher number of channels. The level of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices,\nas more highly integrated chips typically have higher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected\nby changes in the package types used by our customers. For example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has\nlower material costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover, our different non-driver products vary in\naverage selling prices and costs.\nThe proportion of non-driver business would also affect our financial position and results of operations. For\nthe past three years, we have experienced operating losses from our non-driver business. This was partly due to\nlow sales volume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to fully cover expenses such as research and\ndevelopment and operating expenses. We expect, however, to ramp up the volume production and sales of our non-\ndriver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-driver products. Typically, our\nnon-driver products have higher gross margins as well as higher growth potential than our driver products, we expect\nthe overall profit margin across our product platform to improve.\nDesign Wins\nAchieving design wins is important to our business, and it affects our unit shipments. Design wins occur when\na customer incorporates our products into their product designs. There are numerous opportunities for design wins,\nincluding, but not limited to, when panel manufacturers:\n• Introduce new models to improve the cost and/or performance of their existing products or to expand their\nproduct portfolio;\n• establish new fabs and seek to qualify existing or new component suppliers; and\n• replace existing display driver companies due to cost or performance reasons.\n57\nDesign wins are not binding commitments by customers to purchase our products. However, we believe that\nachieving design wins is an important performance indicator. Our customers typically devote substantial time and\nresources to designing their products as well as qualifying their component suppliers and their products. Once our\nproducts have been designed into a system, the customer may be reluctant to change its component suppliers due to\nthe significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier or a replacement component. Therefore, we\nstrive to work closely with current and prospective customers in order to anticipate their requirements and product\nroadmaps and achieve additional design wins.\nCost of Revenues and Cost Reductions\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2018,\n2019 and 2020 was 76.7%, 79.5% and 75.1%, respectively. In 2020, as a percentage of Himax Taiwan’s total\nmanufacturing costs, the cost of wafer fabrication was 47.6%, the cost of processed tape was 10.7%, the cost of\nassembly and testing was 41.1%, and overhead was 0.6%. Our cost of revenues may increase as a result of an\nincrease in raw material prices, any failure to obtain sufficient foundry, assembly or testing capacity or any shortage\nof processed tape or failure to improve our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield. As a result, our ability\nto manage our wafer fabrication costs, costs for processed tape, assembly and testing costs and our manufacturing\nutilization rate or production yield is critical to our performance. In addition, to mitigate declining average selling\nprices, we aim to reduce unit costs by, among other things:\n• improving product design (e.g., having smaller die size allows for a larger number of dies on each wafer,\nthereby reducing the cost of each die);\n• improving manufacturing yields through our close collaboration with our semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers and in our in-house manufacturing facilities; and\n• achieving better pricing from a diversified pool of semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\nsuppliers, reflecting our ability to leverage our scale, volume requirements and close relationships as well\nas our strategy of sourcing from multiple service providers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Management\nDue to the competitive nature of the flat panel display industry and our customers’ need to maintain high capacity\nutilization in order to reduce unit costs per panel, any delays in the delivery of our products could significantly\ndisrupt our customers’ operations. To deliver our products on a timely basis and meet the quality standards\nand technical specifications our customers require, we must have assurances of high-quality capacity from our\nsemiconductor manufacturing service providers. We therefore strive to manage our supply chain by maintaining\nclose relationships with our key semiconductor manufacturing service providers and strive to provide credible\nforecasts of capacity demand and seek for new manufacturing service providers in case of any manufacturer’s\ncapacity shortage. Any disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our performance and could result in a\nloss of customers as well as potentially damage our reputation.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected\nby, our share-based compensation expenses, which consist of charges taken relating to grants of mainly RSUs as\nwell as stock options and non-vested shares to employees.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs). We adopted two long-term incentive plans in October 2005 and September 2011,\nrespectively, which permit the grant of options or RSUs to our employees and non-employees where each unit\nrepresents two ordinary shares. The actual awards will be determined by our compensation committee. The 2005\nplan was terminated in October 2010. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding RSUs under the\nlong-term incentive plan totaling $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $4.8 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nOf the total share-based compensation expenses recognized, $3.8 million, nil and $4.8 million in 2018, 2019 and\n2020, respectively, were settled in cash. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based\npayments at fair value.\n58\nSet forth below is a summary of our historical share-based compensation plans for the years ended December 31,\n2018, 2019 and 2020 as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. However, we did not grant RSUs in 2019\nbut granted stock options to employees instead.\nWe made grants of 597,596 RSUs to our employees on September 25, 2015. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 94.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $4.5\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2016, 2017 and 2018, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,208,785 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2016. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 91.93% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$9.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 580,235 RSUs to our employees on September 29, 2017. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 96.91% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $6.1\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018. The vesting schedule for such RSU\ngrants is as follows: 97.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of $3.8\nmillion on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, which\nwill be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,402,714 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2020. The vesting schedule for such\nRSU grants is as follows: 98.68% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the amount of\n$4.8 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023,\nwhich will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nThe amount of share-based compensation expense with regard to the RSUs granted to our employees on\nSeptember 25, 2015, September 28, 2016, September 29, 2017, September 26, 2018 and September 28, 2020 was\n$7.92 per ADS, $8.30 per ADS, $10.93 per ADS, $5.76 per ADS and $3.44 per ADS, respectively, which was based\non the trading price of our ADSs on that day.\nEmployee stock options. We made grants of 2,226,690 units of stock option to purchase 2,226,690 units ADS to\ncertain employees at an exercise price of $2.27 on September 30, 2019. The vesting schedule was that 50% of the\noptions vest half year after the date of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant. During\n2020, 114,500 units, 39,000 units and 10,000 units of stock option to purchase 114,500 units, 39,000 units and\n10,000 units ADS were grant to certain employees at an exercise price of $2.74, $3.9 and $3.35 on March 31, 2020,\nAugust 11, 2020 and September 25, 2020, respectively. The options granted in 2020 were fully vested on October 1,\n2020. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding stock options under the long-term incentive plan\ntotaling $0.3 million and $0.6 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nTax Credits\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be affected\nby, tax credits available to us.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and development\nexpenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15% of the total qualifying\nresearch and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for\nthe current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for Industrial Innovation may not be\ncarried forward.\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended\nto December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the\nincome tax payable for each year.\n59\nDescription of Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items\nRevenues\nHistorically, we have generated revenues from sales of display drivers for large-sized applications and display\ndrivers for small and medium-sized applications. In addition, our product portfolio includes operational amplifiers,\ntiming controllers, touch controller ICs, LCOS microdisplay, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors, 3D\nsensing, ultralow power smart sensing, wafer level optics products and ASIC service.\nRevenues from large-sized application totaled $240.8 million in 2020, a mild increase of 1.5% year-over-year,\nrepresenting 27.1% of our total revenues, as compared to 35.3% of our total revenues in 2019. During the Covid-19\npandemic, the surge in IT demand boosted the sales of monitor display drivers and notebook display drivers. TV\nsales, however, declined due to weakness in the global TV market which was negatively impacted by the Covid-19\noutbreak.\nRevenues from small and medium-sized applications totaled $515.7 million in 2020, the highest growth of 67.7%\nyear-over-year, representing 58.1% of our total revenues, as compared to 45.8% of our total revenues in 2019. As\nleading Android tablet brands all adopted our TDDI solutions and global smartphone sales rebounded, we saw the\nextraordinary business momentum for both product areas in 2020.\nRevenues from non-driver products totaled $130.8 million in 2020, an increase of 2.9% year-over-year,\nrepresenting 14.8% of our total revenues, as compared to 18.9% of our total revenues a year ago. The year-over-year\nincrease was mainly from TCON amidst the growing need for high frame rate and high-resolution displays, and CIS\ndue to the continuous strong demand in notebook and web camera for work-from-home and online education. This\nincrease was offset by WLO, as the legacy product of an anchor customer gradually decreased.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenues by amount and our revenues as a\npercentage of revenues by each product line:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nDisplay drivers for large-sized\napplications $ 260,540 36.0 $ 237,276 35.3 $ 240,789 27.1\nDisplay drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications 325,718 45.0 307,451 45.8 515,733 58.1\nNon-driver products(1) 137,347 19.0 127,108 18.9 130,760 14.8\nTotal $ 723,605 100.0 $ 671,835 100.0 $ 887,282 100.0\nNote: (1) Includes, among other things, timing controllers, touch controller ICs, LCOS projector solutions,\npower management IC, CMOS image sensors, programmable gamma OP, wafer level optics (WLO)\nproducts, NRE incomes, and ASIC service.\nA limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues. For example, Customer A and its\naffiliates accounted for 28.1%, 29.5% and 32.6% of our revenues in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Customer\nB and its affiliates accounted for 12.6%, 8.9% and 6.6% of our revenues in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nCustomer C accounted for 5.7%, 5.6% and 12.7% of our revenues in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n60\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCustomer A and its affiliates $ 202,995 28.1 $ 198,430 29.5 $ 289,663 32.6\nCustomer B and its affiliates 90,844 12.6 59,781 8.9 58,345 6.6\nCustomer C 41,605 5.7 37,631 5.6 112,504 12.7\nOthers 388,161 53.6 375,993 56.0 426,770 48.1\nTotal $ 723,605 100.0 $ 671,835 100.0 $ 887,282 100.0\nThe global TFT-LCD panel market is highly concentrated, with only a limited number of TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers producing large-sized TFT-LCD panels in high volumes. We sell large-sized panel display drivers\nto many of these TFT-LCD panel manufacturers. Our revenues, therefore, will depend on our ability to capture an\nincreasingly larger percentage of each panel manufacturer’s display driver requirements. The sales to panel makers\nin China have become a significant portion of our revenue due to the Chinese panel maker business expansion which\nstarted in 2011. We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales to Asia-based customers whose end products\nare sold worldwide. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, approximately 23.2%, 19.2% and 13.9% of our revenues, respectively,\nwere from customers headquartered in Taiwan and approximately 66.4%, 70.3% and 79.7% of our revenues,\nrespectively, were from customers headquartered in China. We believe that substantially all of our revenues will\ncontinue to be from customers located in Asia, where almost all of the TFT-LCD panel manufacturers and mobile\ndevice module manufacturers are located. As a result of the regional customer concentration, we expect to continue\nto be subject to economic and political events and other developments that affect our customers in Asia. A substantial\nmajority of our sales invoices are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of revenues, research and development expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses and share-based compensation expenses. Costs would be\ngreatly affected by product mix.\nCost of Revenues\nThe principal items of our cost of revenues are:\n• cost of wafer fabrication;\n• cost of processed tape used in TAB packaging;\n• cost of gold bumping, assembly and testing; and\n• other costs and expenses.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductors and semiconductor solutions to semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers. The costs of wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing depend on\nthe availability of capacity and demand for such services. The wafer fabrication industry, in particular, is highly\ncyclical, resulting in fluctuations in the price of processed wafers depending on the available foundry capacity and\nthe demand for foundry services.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of research and development employee salaries, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, costs associated with prototype wafers, processed tape, masks, molding and tooling\nsets and depreciation on research and development equipment. We expect to continue increasing our spending\non research and development in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue to increase our research\nand development headcount and associated costs to pursue additional product development opportunities. As a\npercentage of revenues, our research and development expenses in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were 17.0%, 17.1% and\n13.8%, respectively.\n61\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of general and administrative employees,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, depreciation on buildings, office furniture and equipment and professional\nfees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts as we\nexpand our operations, hire additional administrative personnel, incur depreciation expenses in connection with the\nincrease in office equipment and Fab 2, and incur additional compliance costs required of a publicly listed company\nin the United States.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries of sales and marketing employees, including\nrelated employee welfare costs, travel expenses and product sample costs. We expect that our sales and marketing\nexpenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts over the next several years. However, we believe that as we\ncontinue to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies, our sales and marketing expenses may\ndecline over time as a percentage of our revenues.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur share-based compensation expenses consist of various forms of share-based compensation that we have\nhistorically issued to our employees and consultants, as well as share-based compensation issued to employees,\ndirectors and service providers under our 2005 and 2011 long-term incentive plans. The 2005 plan was terminated\nin October 2010. We allocate such share-based compensation expenses to the applicable cost of revenues and\nexpense categories as related services are performed. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements. Under\nthe long-term incentive plan, we granted RSUs on December 30, 2005 to our employees and directors and again on\nSeptember 29, 2006, September 26, 2007, September 29, 2008, September 28, 2009, September 28, 2010, September\n28, 2011, September 26, 2012, September 26, 2013, September 26, 2014, September 25, 2015, September 28, 2016,\nSeptember 29, 2017, September 26, 2018 and September 28, 2020 to our employees. We did not grant RSUs in 2019\nbut granted stock options to employees instead. Share-based compensation expenses recorded regarding RSUs under\nthe long-term incentive plan totaled $4.1 million, $0.1 million and $4.8 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nShare-based compensation expenses recorded regarding stock options under the long-term incentive plan totaled $0.3\nmillion and $0.6 million in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries are incorporated in different jurisdictions, we file separate\nincome tax returns. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income or capital gains tax.\nAdditionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands. However, if\nthe relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly advocated, we may be determined\nto be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in accordance with the Income Tax Act\nand relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us would be subject to withholding tax in\nthe ROC. We recognize income taxes at the applicable statutory rates in accordance with the jurisdictions where\nour subsidiaries are located and as adjusted for certain items including accumulated losses carried forward, non-\ndeductible expenses, research and development tax credits, as well as changes in our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”\nthat significantly changes the United States federal income tax system. Among a number of significant changes to\nthe current United States federal income tax rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces the marginal United States\ncorporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest expense, shifts the United States\ntoward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat erosion of the United States federal income\ntax base. The Company does not expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to have a material effect on the Company’s results\nof operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates\nused in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\n62\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and we use judgment and estimate to\ndetermine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period. Due to the rapid technological\nchanges, we estimate the net realizable value of inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of\nreporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of\nthe inventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon. The\ninventory write-downs in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were approximately $17.7 million, $25.4 million and $11.9 million,\nrespectively, and were included in cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-financial Assets other than Goodwill\nWe routinely review our non-financial assets at the reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of\nimpairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount\nof an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing\nvalue in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that\nreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. However, due to\nthe cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy, market requirements, or the needs of our\ncustomers, we may not always be in a position to accurately anticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or\nacquired technology until they occur. Although we have the recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we\nremain positive on the long-term prospect of our non-Driver product segment, judging by the expanding customer\nlist that covers some of the world’s biggest tech names, and the busy engineering activities going on with such\ncustomers. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we did not recognize any impairment loss on\nnon-financial assets.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the\ncash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each\nof the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying\namount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata based on the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss.\nAn impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The assessment of\nimpairment of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate\nthe goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating\nthe recoverable amount of relevant CGU, management is required to make subjective judgments in determining\nthe discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and\nexpenses related to the CGU.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, goodwill in Driver IC CGU and WLO CGU was $26,846 thousand and\n$1,292 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nAccording to the ROC Income Tax Act, dividends distributed by a Taiwan company to its foreign shareholders\nare subject to ROC withholding tax, currently at the rate of 21% on the amount of the distribution in the case of cash\ndividends or on the par value of the ordinary shares in the case of stock dividends. The surtax rate for undistributed\nearnings is currently 5%. However, surtax paid on undistributed earnings can no longer be used to offset against the\nwithholding tax imposed on the dividend distributed to foreign shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not provided for retained earnings tax on the undistributed earnings of\napproximately $640.5 million of our subsidiaries since we have specific plans to reinvest these earnings indefinitely.\nThe undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are mainly from Himax Taiwan totaling approximately $639.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. We intend to use accumulated and future earnings of Himax Taiwan to expand\noperations in Taiwan.\n63\nHowever, a deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Taiwanese company can no longer\ndemonstrate that it plans to reinvest indefinitely these undistributed earnings. This amount becomes\ntaxable when we execute other investments, share buybacks or shareholder dividends to be funded by cash\ndistribution by our foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that\nmight be payable on such undistributed earnings.\nWe are a holding company located in the Cayman Islands and have paid dividends and repurchased\noutstanding shares. To fund such dividends and repurchases, in the past years, we have received cash from\nbank loans and from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings instead of dividends distributed by\nHimax Taiwan.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required to\nestimate income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities for us and our subsidiaries. This process involves\nestimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing\ntreatments of items for tax and accounting purposes and the amount of tax credits and tax loss carry-\nforward. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated\nstatements of financial position. Management must then assess deferred tax assets at each reporting date and\nreduce to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions\nare reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of profit or loss as a percentage\nof revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\nRevenues 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues 76.7 79.5 75.1\nResearch and development 17.0 17.1 13.8\nGeneral and administrative 2.9 3.5 2.7\nSales and marketing 2.9 2.6 1.9\nTotal costs and expenses 99.5 102.7 93.5\nOperating income (loss) 0.5 (2.7) 6.5\nNon-operating income (loss) 0.5 0.4 (0.1)\nIncome tax expense 0.2 0.1 1.3\nProfit (loss) for the year 0.8 (2.4) 5.1\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.4 0.4 0.2\nProfit (loss) attributable to Himax stockholders 1.2 (2.0) 5.3\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues. Our revenues increased by 32.1% to $887.3 million in 2020 from $671.8 million in 2019. The increase\nwas attributable mainly to the highest growth of 67.7% in revenues from small and medium-sized applications to\n$515.7 million in 2020 from $307.4 million in 2019. The increase in demand for these products was driven by the\nnew stay-at-home environment during the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. From a year-over-year perspective, both\ntablet and smartphone demonstrated extraordinary sales growth, yet growth was constrained by the severe foundry\ncapacity shortage. Revenues from display drivers for large-sized application totaled $240.8 million in 2020, a\nmild increase of 1.5% year-over-year. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the surge in IT demand boosted our sales of\nmonitor display drivers and notebook display drivers. TV sales, however, declined year-over-year due to weakness in\nthe global TV market which was negatively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak. Revenues from non-driver products\nincreased to $130.8 million in 2020 from $127.1 million in 2019, an increase of 2.9% year-over-year. The year-over-\nyear increase was mainly from TCON amidst the growing need for high frame rate and high-resolution displays, and\nCIS due to the continuous strong demand in notebook and web camera for work-from-home and online education.\nThis increase was offset by WLO, as the legacy product of an anchor customer gradually decreased.\n64\nCosts and Expenses. Costs and expenses increased by 20.2% to $829.4 million in 2020 from $690.1 million in\n2019. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses decreased to 93.5% in 2020 compared to 102.7% in 2019.\n• Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $666.5 million in 2020 from $533.9 million in 2019. The\nincrease in cost of revenues was due primarily to a 5.4% increase in unit shipments in 2020, as compared to\n2019. Inventory write-downs, which are included in cost of revenues, decreased to $11.9 million in 2020\nfrom $25.4 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues decreased to 75.1% in 2020 from\n79.5% in 2019.\n• Research and Development. Research and development expenses increased by 6.4% to $122.3 million in\n2020 from $114.9 million in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to increase in the salary expense,\ncash bonus, RSU compensation and tape out expense. The increase in salary expense was primarily\nattributable to NT dollar appreciation against US dollar as we pay the bulk of our employee salaries in NT\ndollars.\n• General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 1.0% to $23.9 million in\n2020 from $23.7 million in 2019, primarily as a result of increases in salary expense and RSU\ncompensation.\n• Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 5.8% to $16.7 million in 2020\nfrom $17.6 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in the travel expense but\npartially offset by higher salary expense and RSU compensation.\nNon-Operating Income (loss). We had net non-operating loss of $1.1 million in 2020 compared to net non-\noperating income of $2.5 million in 2019. We recognized change in fair value of financial assets at fair value through\nprofit or loss of $0.5 million in 2020 and $3.7 million in 2019, respectively.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense increased to $11.7 million in 2020 from $0.4 million in 2019. Our\neffective income tax rate increased to 20.6% from (2.6%) in 2019. The increase in our effective income tax rate was\nprimarily attributable to the increase in pre-tax profit $56.9 million in 2020 from pre-tax loss $15.8 million in 2019.\nProfit for the year. As a result of the foregoing, our profit for the year of $45.2 million in 2020, versus our loss\nfor the year was $16.2 million in 2019, and profit attributable to Himax stockholders of $47.1 million in 2020, versus\nloss attributable to Himax stockholders was $13.6 million in 2019.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth the revenues and operating results for our reportable segments for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\n(in thousands)\nSegment Revenues\nDriver IC $ 586,258 $ 544,727 $ 756,522\nNon-Driver Products 137,347 127,108 130,760\nTotal $ 723,605 $ 671,835 $ 887,282\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\n(in thousands)\nSegment Operating Income (loss)\nDriver IC $ 56,023 $ 29,070 $ 98,687\nNon-Driver Products (52,638) (47,377) (40,761)\nTotal $ 3,385 $ (18,307) $ 57,926\n65\nDriver IC Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Driver IC segment increased by 38.9% to $756.5 million in 2020 from\n$544.7 million in 2019. The increase was mainly from the higher growth of 67.7% in display drivers for small and\nmedium-sized applications with sales totaling $515.7 million.\nSegment operating income. Operating income from the Driver IC segment increased to $98.7 million in 2020\nfrom $29.1 million in 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues in 2020 as compared\nto 2019 and higher gross margin.\nNon-Driver Products Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Non-Driver Products segment increased by 2.9% to $130.8 million in\n2020 from $127.1 million in 2019. The year-over-year increase was mainly from TCON and CIS but partially offset\nby WLO decreased.\nSegment operating loss. Operating loss from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased to $40.8 million in\n2020 from $47.4 million in 2019. The operating loss decreases was attributable mainly to the increase in revenues\nand higher gross margin.\n5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe need cash primarily for technology advancement, capacity expansion, paying dividends and working capital.\nWe have historically been able to meet our cash requirements through cash flow from operations and borrowings to\npay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total current assets of $694.4 million, total current liabilities of $352.2 million\nand cash and cash equivalents of $184.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had short-term secured borrowings\nof $104.0 million with cash and time deposits of $104.0 million as collateral, and long-term unsecured borrowings\nof $58.5 million, of which $6.0 million was current portion. For enhancing the guaranty, our land, building and\nimprovements of Fab 2 totaling $71.1 million were pledged as collateral for the long-term unsecured borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total unused short-term credit lines of $280.9 million, of which $21.1 million\nwill expire before the end of March 2021, and $193.0 million belonging to the parent company needs to be secured\nwith equal amount of cash and time deposits when borrowing money from banks. Besides, we had unused long-\nterm credit lines of $40 million. We believe that our existing short-term and long-term credit lines, together with\ncash generated from our operations, are sufficient to liquidity needs. We expect to meet our present working capital\nrequirements through cash flow from operations and bank borrowings from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 4,009 $ 7,656 $ 102,610\nNet cash used in investing activities (38,266) (47,767) (22,365)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 2,801 35,261 3,261\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (31,586) (5,382) 83,883\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 138,023 106,437 101,055\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period 106,437 101,055 184,938\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was $102.6 million compared to $7.7\nmillion in 2019. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was mainly due to improved\nprofitability in 2020 compared to 2019.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was $22.4 million compared to $47.8 million\nin 2019. This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to decrease in acquisition of\n66\nproperty, plant and equipment in 2020 compared to 2019 but partially offset by higher refundable deposits in 2020\ncompared to 2019.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $3.3 million compared to $35.3\nmillion in 2019. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in unsecured borrowings $35.9 million in 2020\ncompared to 2019. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products that are\nsubject to rapid technological change, among other factors, which could result in revenue variability in future\nperiods. In addition, we have at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of our customers. The\nextension of payment terms for our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating\nresults. Our subsidiaries’ ability to distribute dividends and other payments to us may be limited by ROC regulations.\nSee “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Holding Company Structure — Our ability to receive dividends and\nother payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and\nthereby materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and\notherwise fund and conduct our business.”\nOur capital expenditures were incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of property and equipment.\nOur capital expenditures totaled $49.7 million, $45.9 million and $5.8 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively,\nhigher than usual capital expenditure due to our Fab 2 construction and WLO capacity expansion in 2018 and 2019.\nCapital expenditures of $5.8 million in 2020 was mainly for design tools and R&D related equipment related to our\ntraditional IC design business.\nThe capex budget will be funded through our internal resources and banking facilities, if so needed. We will\ncontinue to make capital expenditures to meet the expected growth of our operations. We believe that our working\ncapital and borrowings under our existing and future credit lines should be sufficient for our present requirements.\n5.C. Research and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our core technologies and know-how\nrelating to the semiconductor solutions we offer to the flat panel display industry. In particular, we have committed\na significant portion of our resources to the research and development of non-driver products because we believe\nin the long-term business prospects of such products and are committed to continuing to diversify our product\nportfolio. Although a significant portion of the resources at our integrated circuit design center are invested in\nadvanced research for future products, we continue to invest in improving the performance and reducing the costs of\nour existing products. Our application engineers, who provide on-system verification of semiconductors and product\nspecifications, and field application engineers, who provide on-site engineering support at our customers’ offices\nor factories, work closely with panel manufacturers to co-develop display solutions for their electronic devices. In\n2018, 2019 and 2020, we incurred research and development expenses of $123.0 million, $114.9 million and $122.3\nmillion, respectively, representing 17.0%, 17.1% and 13.8% of our revenues, respectively.\n5.D. Trend Information\n2020 has been a challenging year for both Himax and the world. Uncertainty in the global economy brought by\nCovid-19 overshadowed the marketplace with management of logistics, including worldwide customs operations in\nvarious ports, and the supply chain were impacted significantly. Despite these dramatic headwinds, we saw positive\nmomentum and a strong outlook as many countries reopened following a long period of lockdown. As a result, we\ndelivered a strong financial result compared to 2019 as our business rebounded strongly throughout the second half\nof 2020 with fresh demands brought by the new stay-at-home economy. The upbeat of gross margin in fourth quarter\nof 2020, on the other hand, is a reflection of the industry-wide tight foundry capacity that we can implement better\npricing strategy and product mix to customers.\nAgainst the backdrop of Covid-19 and US sanctions on China brought turbulence to the market, our small/\nmedium driver IC segment posted the highest growth among our three major product categories in 2020 as\nleading Android tablet brands adopted our TDDI solutions and global smartphone sales rebounded. On the\nsupply side, Himax and some of our major panel customers were already seeing foundry capacity shortage of\n8-inch and 12-inch silicon wafers for display driver ICs as industry-wide capacity shortage appears to be a long-\nterm phenomenon and the overall semiconductor industry supply will not have any significant increase any time\nsoon. Himax is also experiencing major foundry supply shortage in quite a few business areas, including TDDI\nand DDIC for smartphone, tablet and automotive applications as well as CMOS. Robust demand pushed foundry\ncapacity constraints to a more severe level and has extended to backend facilities that include assembly and\ntesting. In anticipation of this, we engaged early with foundries and have succeeded in securing more capacity\nfor 2021 as compared to the level of fourth quarter of 2020 when we reached the recent peak quarterly shipment.\n67\nLarge-sized Display Driver IC Segment\nSensing strong signs of panel price recovery, panel makers began to increase production starting the third quarter\nof 2020. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the surge in IT demand boosted our sales of monitor and notebook display\ndrivers. Our TV sales declined as global TV market was negatively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. We\nsaw customers proceeding with aggressive promotion in high-resolution models, that require high end drivers and\nTCON, in anticipation of sustained strong demand for home entertainment during the Covid-19 pandemic. However,\nour display driver IC and TCON shipments are still capped by supply shortage in foundry and packaging, despite\nfirm demand from strong consumer spending and home entertainment demand.\nSmall and Medium-Sized Display Driver IC Segment\nIn this segment, our TDDI product roadmap as well as new design-wins with end customers and a foundry\ncapacity advantage have positioned Himax to gain market share. TDDI for both tablet and smartphone posted\nextraordinary sales growth especially in the second half of 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we see continuous\nstrong TDDI sales with demand still surpassing supply. Foundry capacity remains a major issue that adversely\nimpacts our shipping capability. With smartphone and tablet sharing the same foundry pool, we strategically allocate\ncapacity to the products where we are the dominant or sole supplier.\nTablet was one of our top sales contributors in 2020 thanks largely to the fast rising TDDI penetration for\nAndroid names and the strong demand driven by the stay-at-home economy. To further broaden our product offering\nand solidify our market position, our tablet TDDI has moved toward higher frame rate, higher resolution and larger\nscreen sized solutions. We have also enhanced touch accuracy through our leading active stylus design for better-\nquality handwriting and drawing.\nAs expected, our traditional discrete driver IC sales into smartphone continue its declining trend in 2020 as the\nmarket is being quickly replaced by TDDI and AMOLED. Himax is highly committed to AMOLED technology.\nOur development started from smartphone, and has extended to wearable, tablet and automotive. We have some\nencouraging progresses with leading Chinese panel makers and will report in due course. We believe AMOLED\ndriver IC will soon become one of the major growth drivers for our small and medium panel driver IC business.\nIn the automotive display segment, the number of displays per vehicle continues to rise as the overall automobile\nmarket recovered from the third quarter 2020, despite the global shortage of semiconductor components has brought\ngreat challenges to the world's automotive industry. As most of the world’s lockdown periods end, tightening\nfoundry capacity, combined with the sudden surge in orders due to pent-up demand, have left the industry facing\nan even more severe shortage compared to other sectors. Customers now rely on “just in time” delivery of IC\ncomponents to preserve production. In consideration of unceasing sales demand amidst tight capacity shortage, we\nworked strategically with panel makers, tier-1 and end customers, across different continents, and have secured an\nenlarged volume of foundry capacity while managing swift production adjustments to meet customers’ production\nschedules. By offering supportive logistics, we hope to further our relationship with customers, who can in return\nhelp accelerate our new technology into their new models going forward.\nWith electric vehicles quickly emerging as the “next big thing”, we see the car market embracing new display\ntechnologies and shifting towards larger, more sophisticated and higher performing displays like never before.\nAlready the market leader in automotive display driver business, we foresee further market share gains in the coming\nyears in this fast-growing market. We continue to sustain our competitive position with a comprehensive product\noffering for advanced new features such as TDDI for in-cell touch, local dimming, cascade-topology connection,\nP2P high-speed interface bridging functions, and LTDI for larger in-cell display. As a reminder, we launched the\nworld’s first TDDI design for automotive displays technology which started shipping in 2019 with meaningful\nvolume anticipated starting 2021. As EV grows in popularity and autonomous driving develops, our technological\nprowess continues to separate us from peers for the next generation display for automotive.\nThe non-driver category has been our most exciting growth area and a differentiator for the Company. We are\ndevoted to the development, manufacturing and marketing of non-driver products to diversify our customer base and\nproduct portfolio to offer total solutions of image processing and human interface related technologies in addition to\nour driver IC products. Our non-driver products delivered the strongest growth in 2014 owing to many new product\nlaunches and project wins. During 2016, our non-driver businesses experienced tremendous growth, primarily driven\nby the LCOS and WLO businesses due to shipments to one of our leading AR device customers. Additionally, our\nWLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor customer.\n68\nThe overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption\nin more models. In 2020, we continued to fulfill anchor customer’s demand for the legacy product. We continue\nto make progress with our ongoing R&D projects for next generation products centered around our exceptional\ndesign know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology. With leading nanoimprinting technologies and\ndiffraction optics design capability, we continue to engage and collaborate with key customers and partners for their\nnext generation products, which focuses on ToF 3D sensing, AR/VR gadgets, biomedical devices and others.\n3D sensing in the smartphone segment, we have advanced our WLO optics solution to cover time-of-flight (ToF)\n3D sensing. We are seeing more ToF camera design activities among Android smartphone makers for 3D sensing\nand are making good progress by offering our leading ToF optical components including diffractive DOEs, micro-\nlens arrays and diffusers to meet diversified demand from a wide variety of customers/partners including VCSEL\nsuppliers, ToF sensor vendors, ToF module makers and smartphone OEMs. Our non-smartphone 3D-sensing\nengagements, we provide customers who wish to design their own structured light-based 3D sensing solution with\nour proprietary 3D decoder IC. Our 3D decoder can accelerate local image processing for face recognition and offer\nbest-in-class security authentication. It was already certified by the leading Chinese electronic payment standard\nwith requirements of accurate data decoding, timely operation and strict privacy. We have started volume shipment\nin the third quarter of 2020 with decent order pipeline for 2021 and further new design-in sockets on the way.\nRegarding ultralow power smart sensing, the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent\nsensing is rapidly growing. WiseEye is our AI-based ultralow power smart sensing solution, built on Emza’s or third-\nparty’s AI-based algorithm, on top of Himax’s proprietary computer vision processor, WE-I Plus, and CMOS image\nsensor, all equipped with ultralow power design. For total solution, we are currently aiming at notebook, TV and air\nconditioner applications, and have received positive feedbacks. We expect to start a solid production ramp-up by\nthe end of 2021. With joint efforts with our subsidiary EMZA and other algorithm partners, further engagements are\non the way for more applications such as doorbell, door lock, automotive and various IoT devices for industrial and\ncommercial uses. We are thrilled about the business progress achieved.\nFor the other business model of our smart sensing where we provide key components, our WE-I Plus AI processor\nadopted Google TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers framework in June 2020 and has successfully demonstrated\nour unrivaled computing capability with ultralow power. In December 2020, we partnered with SparkFun, an online\nretail store, to distribute Himax WE-I Plus Edge AI evaluation board and AoS sensor modules. Developers can now\naccess our technologies easily from SparkFun and transform their AI-enabling concept which call for ultralow power\nand computer vision AI into real products. Furthermore, we teamed up with Edge Impulse who provides a leading\nend-to-end AI developer platform offering intuitive user interface. On Edge Impulse’ platform, with a single button\npress and within seconds, developers can now generate the latest neural network AI model and export it directly onto\nthe WE-I Plus evaluation board. The high technical obstacles developers usually face can therefore be dramatically\nlowered.\nTogether with our partners, we are carrying out a wide range of promotional activities to broaden WiseEye’s\nmarket reach and establish direct contacts with more AI developers. We believe the WiseEye offerings will start\ncontributing to our top and bottom lines later 2021. We aim to make it a major contributor to our long-term business\ngrowth.\nWe see continuous surging demands for our CMOS image sensors for web camera and notebook as the new norm\nof virtual conferences shows no signs of receding. Separately, our industry-first 2-in-1 CMOS image sensor that\nsupports RGB mode for video conferencing and ultralow power AI mode for facial recognition have penetrated the\nlaptop market for the most stylish super slim bezel designs. We have shipped small quantity in the fourth quarter of\n2020 and expect to ship more during 2021.\nOn timing controller, the aggressive promotion by major TV brands will benefit our high-end TCON business\nas our 8K TV timing controllers, as well as display drivers, have been widely adopted by multiple leading end\ncustomers. Our TCON technology not only provides higher resolution, higher frame rate and better image quality,\nit can also enable lower power in products where power consumption is critical. Timing controller products enjoy\nbetter margin and ASP than those of display drivers and now it represents over 5% of our total sales. We expect this\nsegment to be an extensive long-term growth area.\n69\nLastly, on LCOS, we continue to focus on AR goggle devices and head-up-displays (HUD) for automotive.\nMany of our industry-leading customers have demonstrated their state-of-the-art products, including holographic\nHUD, AR glasses and LiDAR system, with Himax LCOS technology inside. Our technology leadership and\nproven manufacturing expertise have made us a preferred partner for customers in these emerging markets and\ntheir ongoing engineering projects in AR goggles and HUD for automotive applications.\nFor more trend information, see “Item 5.A. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Operating Results.”\n5.E. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance-sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions\nor foreign currency forwards. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2020, we did not have any interests in variable interest entities.\n5.F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nPayment Due by Period\nLess than 1-3 3-5 More than\nTotal 1 year years years 5 years\n(in thousands)\nShort-term secured borrowings 104,000 104,000 - - -\nLong-term unsecured borrowings 58,500 6,000 12,000 12,000 28,500\nPurchase obligations(1) 294,004 294,004 - - -\nOther obligations 5,608 2,542 2,056 1,010 -\nTotal 462,112 406,546 14,056 13,010 28,500\nNotes: (1) Includes obligations for purchase of equipment, computer software and machinery and wafer fabrication,\nraw material, supplies, assembly and testing services.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the short-term secured borrowings consisted of bank loans with interest rates per\nannum that ranged from 0.33% to 0.40%, and cash and time deposit totaling $104,000 thousand are pledged as\ncollateral. The long-term unsecured borrowings consisted of bank loans with interest rates per annum that ranged\nfrom 0.68819% to 0.92112%, with our land, building and improvements of Fab 2 totaling $71.1 million were\npledged as collateral for enhancing the guaranty.\nWe have, from time to time, entered into contracts for the acquisition of equipment and computer software.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining commitments under such contracts were $3.9 million.

Total contributions to the defined benefit plan and\nthe new defined contribution plan in 2020 were $3.3 million compared to $3.4 million and $3.7 million in 2019 and\n2018, respectively. Such changes in contributions have not, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our\ncash flows or results of operations.\n70\nInflation\nInflation in Taiwan has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years. However, an\nincrease in inflation can lead to increases in our costs and lower our profit margins. According to the Directorate\nGeneral of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, ROC, the changes of the consumer price index in\nTaiwan were 1.35%, 0.56% and -0.23% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n5.G.

None of our\nnon-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination of service.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nTo enhance our corporate governance, we have established three committees under the board of directors: the\naudit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee. We have\nadopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committee’s members and functions are described below.\nAudit Committee. Our audit committee currently consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng, Hsiung-Ku Chen and Dr.\nYan-Kuin Su. Our board of directors has determined that all of our audit committee members are “independent\ndirectors” within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules and meet the criteria for independence\nset forth in Section 10A(m)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act.

Our compensation committee assists our board of directors in reviewing and\napproving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive\nofficers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting where his or her compensation\nis deliberated. We intend to follow Rule 5605(d)(1)(B) and (2)(B) of the Nasdaq Rules which requires the\ncompensation committees of U.S. companies to be comprised solely of independent directors.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for options\ngranted to participants outside the United States, the committee can set options that have terms greater than ten\nyears.\nOptions will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such terms and conditions as the committee\napproves. A condition of the delivery of shares as to which an option will be exercised will be the payment of\nthe exercise price. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of written\nnotification of exercise and full payment, we will deliver to the participant evidence of book-entry shares or, upon\nhis or her request, share certificates in an appropriate amount based on the number of shares purchased under\nthe option(s).

Share Ownership\nThe following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares, as of February 28, 2021,\nby each of our directors and executive officers. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the\nrules and regulations of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the\npercentage ownership of that person, we have included shares that the person has the right to acquire within\n60 days, including through the exercise of option. These shares, however, are not included in the computation\nof the percentage ownership of any other person.\nNumber of Shares Percentage of Shares\nName Owned Owned\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu 74,579,944 21.4%\nJordan Wu(1) 7,456,441 2.1%\nDr. Yan-Kuin Su - -\nYuan-Chuan Horng 916,104 *\nHsiung-Ku Chen - -\nJessica Pan(2) 81,112 *\nNorman Hung(3) 560,230 *\nEric Li 15,000 *\nNote: (1) The number of ordinary shares beneficially owned represents (i) 7,399,077 ordinary shares, among which,\nJordan Wu directly owns 353,683 ordinary shares and beneficially owns 6,600,212 ordinary shares and\n445,182 ordinary shares through Arch Finance Ltd. and Shu Chuan Investment Co., Ltd, respectively,\nboth of which are investment companies controlled by Jordan Wu; and (ii) 57,364 ordinary shares\nunderlying the stock options we granted to Jordan Wu in 2019 under our 2011 long-term incentive plan,\nwhich will be exercisable within 60 days after February 28, 2021.\n(2) The numbers of shares beneficially owned represents (i) 68,112 ordinary shares held by Jessica Pan; and\n(ii) 13,000 ordinary shares underlying the stock options we granted to Jessica Pan in 2019 under our 2011\nlong-term incentive plan, which will be exercisable within 60 days after February 28, 2021.\n(3) The numbers of shares beneficially owned represents (i) 532,230 ordinary shares held by Norman Hung;\nand (ii) 28,000 ordinary shares underlying the stock options we granted to Norman Hung in 2019 under\nour 2011 long-term incentive plan, which will be exercisable within 60 days after February 28, 2021.\n* The sum of the number of ordinary shares held and the number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of\nall options held is less than 1.0% of our total outstanding shares.\nNone of our directors or executive officers has voting rights different from those of other shareholders.\nITEM 7. MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n7.A. Major Shareholders\nOn August 10, 2009, we effected certain changes in our capital stock structure in order to meet the Taiwan\nStock Exchange’s primary listing requirement that the par value of shares be NT$10 or $0.3 per share and in order\nto increase the number of outstanding ordinary shares to be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. In particular, we\nincreased our authorized share capital from $50,000 (divided into 500,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) to\n$300,000,000 (divided into 3,000,000,000,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each) and distributed 5,999 bonus shares\nfor each share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009. These were followed by a\nconsolidation of every 3,000 shares of par value $0.0001 each into one ordinary share of par value $0.3 each. As a\nresult, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was doubled and each of our ordinary shares had a par value of $0.3.\nIn connection with the above changes, we also changed our ADS ratio effective August 10, 2009 from one\nADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing two ordinary shares. Such change in ADS ratio was\nintended to adjust for the net dilutive effect due to the bonus shares distribution and the shares consolidation so\nthat each ADS would represent the same percentage ownership in our share capital immediately before and after\nthe above changes. The number of ADSs also remained the same immediately before and after the above changes.\n79\nAs of February 28, 2021, 348,178,330 of our shares were outstanding. We believe that, of such shares,\n213,212,842 shares in the form of ADSs were registered in the name of a nominee of JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A., the depositary under our ADS deposit agreement. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., advised us that, as of\nFebruary 28, 2021, 106,606,421 ADSs, representing 213,212,842 common shares, were held of record by\nCede & Co. and 6 other registered shareholders domiciled in and outside of the United States. We have no\nfurther information as to common shares held, or beneficially owned, by U.S. persons.\nThe following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our\nshares as of February 28, 2021, the most recent practicable date, by (i) each shareholder known by us to\nbeneficially own more than 5% of our shares and (ii) all directors and executive officers as a group.\nNumber of Shares Percentage of Shares\nName of Beneficial Owner Beneficially Owned(4) Beneficially Owned(4)\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu(1) 74,579,944 21.4%\nWhei-Lan Teng(2) 21,135,720 6.1%\nAll directors and executive officers as a group(3) 83,608,831 24.0%\nNote: (1) Dr. Biing-Seng Wu directly owns 315,322 ordinary shares. Dr. Biing-Seng Wu beneficially owns\n51,009,690 ordinary shares and 20,039,838 ordinary shares through Sanfair Asia Investments Ltd. and\nChi-Duan Investment Co., Ltd., respectively, both of which are investment companies controlled by Dr.\nBiing-Seng Wu. Additionally, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu beneficially owns 1,607,547 ADSs purchased through\nSanfair Asia Investments Ltd. in the open market according to his share purchase plan announced on\nNovember 30, 2018. Accordingly, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate\nof 74,579,944 ordinary shares, representing approximately 21.4% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(2) Whei-Lan Teng directly owns 1,335,548 ordinary shares. Whei-Lan Teng beneficially owns 2,643,782\nordinary shares through Renmar Finance Limited, which is an investment company controlled by\nWhei-Lan Teng. In addition, Whei-Lan Teng, may be attributed beneficial ownership of 17,156,390\nordinary shares held in trust by Corenmar Investment Limited for the benefit of her children. Whei-Lan\nTeng therefore may be deemed to have shared power to vote or dispose of 21,135,720 ordinary shares.\nAccordingly, Whei-Lan Teng may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 21,135,720 ordinary\nshares, representing approximately 6.1% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(3) Numbers of shares beneficially owned by all directors and executive officers as a group already include\nan aggregate of 74,579,944 ordinary shares beneficially owned by Dr. Biing-Seng Wu. The shares\nbeneficially owned by a group also take into account 98,364 ordinary shares underlying the stock options\nheld by such a group that are exercisable within 60 days after February 28, 2021.\n(4) For each person and group included in this column, percentage ownership is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of shares beneficially owned by such person or group by the sum of (i) 348,178,330, being the\nnumber of ordinary shares outstanding as of February 28, 2021 and (ii) the number of ordinary shares\nunderlying stock options held by such person or group that are exercisable within 60 days after\nFebruary 28, 2021.\nNone of our major shareholders has voting rights different from those of other shareholders. We are not aware\nof any arrangement that may, at a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company.\n7.B.

Dividends and Dividend Policy\nSubject to the Cayman Islands Companies Law, we may declare dividends in any currency, but no dividend\nmay be declared in excess of the amount recommended by our board of directors. Whether our board of directors\nrecommends any dividends and the form, frequency and amount of dividends, if any, will depend upon our future\noperations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and\nother factors as the board of directors may deem relevant.\nOn June 27, 2008, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $66.8 million, or the equivalent of $0.350 per ADS.\nIn 2009, we paid a cash dividend on June 29, 2009 in the amount of $55.5 million, or the equivalent of $0.300 per\nADS, and distributed a stock dividend on August 10, 2009 of 5,999 ordinary shares of par value $0.0001 for each\nordinary share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009.

Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” The\ndividends for any of these years should not be considered representative of the dividends that would be paid in any\nfuture periods or of our dividend policy.\nOur ability to pay cash or stock dividends will depend, at least partially, upon the amount of funds received by\nus from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, which must comply with the laws and regulations of their respective\ncountries and respective articles of association. We receive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany\nborrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends in the past. In accordance with amended ROC Company\nAct and regulations and Himax Taiwan’s amended articles of incorporation, Himax Taiwan is permitted to distribute\ndividends after allowances have been made for:\n• payment of taxes;\n• recovery of prior years’ deficits, if any;\n• legal reserve (in an amount equal to 10% of annual profits after having deducted the above items until such\ntime as its legal reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital);\n• special reserve based on relevant laws or regulations, or retained earnings, if necessary; and\n• dividends for preferred shares, if any.\nFurthermore, if Himax Taiwan does not generate any profits for any year as determined in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in Taiwan, it generally may not distribute dividends for that year.\nAny dividend we declare will be paid to the holders of ADSs, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement,\nto the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations,\nless the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Any dividend we declare will be distributed by\nthe depositary bank to the holders of our ADSs. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S.\ndollars.\n8.B.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur shareholders previously adopted the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association on September 26,\n2005 by a special resolution passed by the sole shareholder of our company and the Amended and Restated Articles\nof Association at an extraordinary shareholder meeting held on October 25, 2005, both of which were filed as an\nexhibit to our registration statement on Form F-1 (file no. 333-132372) with the SEC on March 13, 2006.\nAt our annual general meeting on August 6, 2009, our shareholders adopted the Second Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, which became effective on August 10, 2009 and were filed as exhibits\nto our current report on Form 6-K with the SEC on July 13, 2009. These were adopted primarily in connection with\nour proposed Taiwan listing to meet the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s primary listing requirement concerning protection\nof material shareholders’ rights under the ROC’s Company Act and Securities Exchange Act. At the same time, our\nshareholders also adopted the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were\nfiled as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 with the SEC on\nJune 3, 2010 and are substantially the same as the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association\nof our company except that our authorized share capital is stated to be $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000\nshares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each, on the condition that it shall become effective if the application made\nby our company to list its ordinary shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange is rejected or aborted. On May 20, 2010,\nthe Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association became effective as a result of the\ntermination of our primary listing application to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\nWe incorporate by reference into this annual report the description of our Amended and Restated Memorandum\nand Articles of Association (except for provisions relating to our authorized share capital) contained in our F-1\nregistration statement (File No. 333-132372) filed with the SEC on March 13, 2006. Such description sets forth\na summary of certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association as currently in effect, which is\nqualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles\nof Association. As of the date of this annual report, our authorized share capital is $300,000,000 divided into\n1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each.\n10.C. Material Contracts\nWe are not currently, and have not been in the last two years, party to any material contract, other than contracts\nentered into the ordinary course of business.\n10.D. Exchange Controls\nWe have extracted from publicly available documents the information presented in this section. The information\nbelow may be applicable because our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, is incorporated in the\nROC. Please note that citizens of the PRC and entities organized in the PRC are subject to special ROC laws, rules\nand regulations, which are not discussed in this section.\nThe ROC’s Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange transactions must\nbe executed by banks designated to handle foreign exchange transactions by the Central Bank of the ROC. There is\nan annual limit on the amount of currency a Taiwanese entity may convert into, or out of, NT dollars other than for\ntrade purposes. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions.\nWith regard to inward and outward remittances (foreign exchange purchased or sold), approval by the Central\nBank of the ROC is generally required for any conversion exceeding, in aggregate in each calendar year, $50 million\n(or its equivalent) for companies and $5 million (or its equivalent) for Taiwanese and resident foreign individuals. A\n83\nrequirement is also imposed on all private enterprises to report all medium- and long-term foreign debt with the\nCentral Bank of the ROC.\nIn addition, a foreign person without an alien resident card or an unrecognized foreign entity may remit to and\nfrom Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $100,000 per remittance if required documentation is provided to the ROC\nauthorities. This limit applies only to remittances involving a conversion between NT dollars and U.S. dollars or\nother foreign currencies.\n10.E. Taxation\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or\nappreciation, and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to\nbe material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp duties which may be applicable\non instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not\nparty to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations or currency restrictions in the Cayman\nIslands.\nWe have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, obtained an\nundertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:\n(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or gains or\nappreciations shall apply to us or our operations;\n(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our\nordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.\nThe undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from May 3, 2005.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders described\nbelow of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, but it does not purport to be a comprehensive\ndescription of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to hold the securities. This\ndiscussion applies only to a U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes. This discussion does not address any aspect of the “Medicare contributions tax” on “net investment\nincome.” In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences that may be relevant in light of the U.S.\nHolder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum tax consequences and tax consequences applicable\nto U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:\n• certain financial institutions;\n• dealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale, conversion\ntransaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with respect to the ordinary\nshares or ADSs;\n• persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;\n• entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• tax-exempt entities, including “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”;\n• persons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of our voting stock; or\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of the\nUnited States.\n84\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares or\nADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the\nactivities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ordinary shares or ADSs and partners in such partnerships should\nconsult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the\nordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative pronouncements,\njudicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the date hereof. These laws\nare subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on representations by the depositary\nand assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in\naccordance with its terms. You should consult your tax adviser concerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.\nS. tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a person that is, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a beneficial owner of ordinary\nshares or ADSs and is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other entity taxable as a\ncorporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; or\n(iii) an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the\nunderlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if a U.S.\nHolder exchanges ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.\nThe U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released before\ndelivery of shares to the depositary (“pre-release”) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming\nof foreign tax credits for U.S. holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent\nwith the claiming of the preferred rates of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-\ncorporate U.S. holders. Accordingly, the availability of the preferential tax rates for dividends received by certain\nnon-corporate U.S. Holders, described below, could be affected by actions taken by parties to whom ADSs are\npre-released.\nThis discussion assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company (as\ndiscussed below).\nTaxation of Distributions\nDistributions received by U.S. Holders with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs, other than certain pro\nrata distributions of ordinary shares, will constitute foreign-source dividend income for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined in accordance\nwith U.S. federal income tax principles. We do not to maintain records of earnings and profits in accordance with\nU.S. federal income tax principles, and therefore it is expected that distributions will generally be reported to U.S.\nHolders as dividends. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the U.S. Holder’s (or\nin the case of ADSs, the depository’s) receipt of the dividends. Subject to applicable limitations and the discussion\nabove regarding concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury, certain dividends paid by qualified foreign corporations\nto certain non-corporate holders may be taxable at preferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains.\nA foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid on stock that is\nreadily tradable on a securities market in the United States, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where our\nADSs are traded. Our ordinary shares are not traded on a securities market in the United States. Non-corporate U.S.\nHolders of our ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their tax advisers regarding their eligibility for taxation at\nsuch preferential rates and whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at such\npreferential rates. Corporate U.S. Holders will not be entitled to claim the dividends-received deduction with\nrespect to dividends paid by us.\nSale and Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\nA U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes\non the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, which will be long-term capital gain or loss if the\nordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate U.S.\nHolders may be taxable at preferential rates. The amount of gain or loss will be equal to the difference between\nthe amount realized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs.\nThe deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n85\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nWe believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn general, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year\nin which (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents and\nroyalties) or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held\nfor the production of, passive income (including cash). If a corporation owns at least 25% (by value) of the stock\nof another corporation, the corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as owning its proportionate\nshare of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s\nincome. As PFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets from\ntime to time (and the value of our assets may be determined, in part, based on the market price of our shares\nand ADSs, which may fluctuate considerably from time to time given that market prices of certain technology\ncompanies historically have been volatile), there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any taxable\nyear.\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held ordinary shares or ADSs, certain\nadverse U.S. federal income tax rules would apply on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge) of ordinary\nshares or ADSs by the U.S. Holder. In general, under those rules, gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on a sale or\nother disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for\nthe ordinary shares or ADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or other disposition and to any\nyear before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable\nyear would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as appropriate, for that\ntaxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax attributable to such allocated amounts. Similar\nrules would apply to any distribution in respect of ordinary shares or ADSs to the extent in excess of 125% of the\naverage of the annual distributions on ordinary shares or ADSs received by the U.S. Holder during the preceding\nthree years or the U.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter. Certain elections may be available that\nwould result in alternative treatments (such as a mark-to-market treatment of the ADSs). U.S. Holders should\nconsult their tax advisers to determine whether any of these elections would be available and, if so, what the\nconsequences of the alternative treatments would be in their particular circumstances.\nIf we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year, the preferential tax\nrates discussed above with respect to dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders would not apply.\nIn addition, if U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares or ADSs during any year in which we are a PFIC, the U.S.\nHolder may be required to file certain information reports, containing such information as the U.S. Treasury may\nrequire.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related\nfinancial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding,\nunless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the U.S. Holder provides a\ncorrect taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding. The amount of any\nbackup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund, provided that the required information is\ntimely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\n10.F.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates is primarily the interest income\ngenerated by our cash deposited with banks. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks related to bank\nborrowings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. The U.S. dollar is also the functional currency\nfor the majority of our operations. In 2020, more than 99% of our sales and cost of revenues were denominated\nin U.S. dollars. However, in December 2020, approximately 76% of our operating expenses were denominated in\nNT dollars, with a small percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel new shekel and Chinese\nRenminbi, and the majority of the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. We anticipate that we will continue to\nconduct substantially all of our sales in U.S. dollars. We do not believe that we have a material currency risk with\nregard to the NT dollar. We believe the majority of any potential adverse foreign currency exchange impacts on our\noperating assets may be offset by a potential favorable foreign currency exchange impact on our operating liabilities.\nFrom time to time we have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, forward contracts to hedge against our\nforeign currency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2020, no foreign currency exchange contracts are outstanding.\nITEM 12.

The\ndepositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts\ndistributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its\nannual fee for depositary services by deduction from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or\ncharging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The depositary may collect any of\nits fees by deduction from any cash distribution payable to ADS holders that are obligated to pay those fees.\nThe depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are\npaid.\nFrom time to time, the depositary may make payments to us to reimburse and/or share revenue from\nthe fees collected from ADS holders, or waive fees and expenses for services provided, generally relating\nto costs and expenses arising out of establishment and maintenance of the ADS program. In performing its\nduties under the deposit agreement, the depositary may use brokers, dealers or other service providers that\nare affiliates of the depositary and that may earn or share fees or commissions.\nFees and Other Payments from the Depositary to Us\nIn 2020, we did not receive any payment or fee from the depositary relating to the ADR program.\nAppointment of New Depositary Bank\nOn July 14, 2017, we appointed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as our new American depositary receipt\nbank.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\nIFRS as issued by the IASB.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our\ntransactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our\nfinancial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and expenditures\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of our chief executive and chief financial officers, assessed the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as of December\n31, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, our management believes that\nour internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nAttestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Himax Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and\n2020, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash\nflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the\n“consolidated financial statements”), and our report dated March 31, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those\nconsolidated financial statements.\n89\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting\nwas maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit\nalso included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that\nour audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nMarch 31, 2021\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn 2020, no change in our internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the period covered by\nthis annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nITEM 16.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(With Report of Independent Registered\nPublic Accounting Firm Thereon)\nF-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Himax Technologies, Inc.\nand subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the related consolidated statements\nof profit or loss, other comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the\nthree-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated\nMarch 31, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are\na public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures\nto assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test\nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a\nseparate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nImpairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer Level Optics cash generating unit\nAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the balance of property, plant and\nequipment was $132,074 thousand as of December 31, 2020, a portion of which related to the Wafer Level\nOptics cash generating unit (“CGU”). The Company’s property, plant and equipment is reviewed at the\nreporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists,\nimpairment assessment will be performed by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its recoverable\namount. The recoverable amount used in impairment assessment for the Wafer Level Optics CGU is value in\nuse, which is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows to their present value using a pre-tax\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the\nasset.\nWe identified the impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer Level Optics CGU as\na critical audit matter because of the high degree of subjective auditor’s judgment required in evaluating the\nforecasted future revenues and discount rate assumptions and minor changes to those assumptions could have\na significant effect on the Company’s impairment assessment of property, plant and equipment in the Wafer\nLevel Optics CGU. In addition, the evaluation of the discount rate involved specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We\ntested certain internal controls over the Company’s impairment assessment process of property, plant and\nequipment, including controls related to the determination of forecasted future revenues and the assumptions\nused to develop the discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted future revenues by comparing\nthem to the historical revenues of the CGU and industry revenue forecasts. We compared the Company’s\nhistorical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast future\nrevenues. We performed sensitivity analyses over the forecasted future revenues and discount rate to assess\ntheir impact on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with\nspecialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s discount rate, by comparing it\nagainst a range of estimated discount rates developed independently based on market data and inputs.\n/s/ KPMG\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2001.\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nMarch 31, 2021\nF-3\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(f) Financial Instruments\nThe Company shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of\nfinancial position when, and only when, the Company becomes party to the contractual\nprovisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be\nrecognized and derecognized, as applicable, using trade date accounting.\n1. Financial Assets\n(i) Classification of financial assets\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the\nfinancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets\nare classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, measured at\nfair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and measured at fair value\nthrough profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is generally\nbased on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual\ncash flow characteristics. When, and only when, the Company changes its business\nmodel for managing financial assets it shall reclassify all affected financial assets.\ni. Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following\nconditions and is not designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss:\n(i) the asset held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to\ncollect contractual cash flows; and\n(ii) the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are\nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured at\namortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced\nby impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and\nimpairment are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is\nrecognized in profit or loss.\nii. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI)\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the\nCompany may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s\nfair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nF-18\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nEquity investments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends\nare recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents\na recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are\nrecognized in OCI. When an investment is derecognized, the cumulative gain\nor loss in equity will not be reclassified to profit or loss, instead, is reclassified to\nretained earnings.\niii. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair\nvalue through profit or loss.\nSuch financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, and attributable\ntransaction costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial\nrecognition, they are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in\nprofit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and contract assets.\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable and contract assets are measured at an\namount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost\nand contract assets, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount\nequal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial\ninstrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has\nbeen a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance\nis recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible\ndefault events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and\nsupportable information that is relevant. This includes both qualitative and\nquantitative information and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience\nand credit assessment as well as forward-looking information.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial\ninstruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss\nallowance account.\nF-19\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(iii) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another\nentity.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received\nand receivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an\ninvestment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had\nbeen recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained\nearnings, without recycling through profit or loss.\n2. Financial Liabilities\n(i) Classification of financial liability\nThe Company classify all financial liabilities as measured at amortized cost, except\nfor financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities,\nincluding derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.\n(ii) Derecognition of financial liability\nThe Company removes a financial liability from its statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, it is extinguished-when the obligation specified in the contract\nis discharged or cancelled or expires.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to\nanother party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or\nliabilities assumed, shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n(g) Inventories\nInventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods awaiting\nfinal assembly and test and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ndetermined using the weighted-average method. For work-in-process and manufactured\ninventories, cost consists of the cost of raw materials (primarily fabricated wafer and processed\ntape), direct labor and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realizable value\nfor raw materials is based on replacement cost. Net realizable value for finished goods and\nwork in process is calculated based on the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of\ncompletion and necessary selling costs.\nF-20\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(h) Equity Method Investments\nEquity investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence over the operating and financial policy decisions of the investee but does not have\na controlling financial interest in the investee, are accounted for using the equity method.\nThe Company’s share of the net income or net loss of an investee is recognized in earnings\nfrom the date the significant influence commences until the date that significant influence\nceases. The difference between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying\nequity in net assets of an investee at investment date is allocated to related assets which are\namortized over their useful lives. Any unallocated difference is treated as investor-level\ngoodwill and is not amortized.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company\nceases to have significant influence over an associate, and then measures the retained interests\nat fair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the\ndate the equity method was discontinued and the fair value of the retained interests along with\nany proceeds from disposing of a part of the interest in the associate is recognized in profit\nor loss. When the Company discontinues the use of the equity method, the Company shall\naccount for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to\nthat investment on the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly\ndisposed of the related assets or liabilities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, if there is any indication of impairment, the entire carrying\namount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment as a single asset, by\ncomparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. An impairment loss recognized\nforms part of the carrying amount of the investment in associates. Accordingly, any reversal of\nthat impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment\nsubsequently increases.\n(i) Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of land, building and machinery and\nequipment used in the design and development of products, and is stated at cost less\naccumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation on building and\nmachinery and equipment commences when the asset is ready for its intended use. Except for\nthe following paragraph, depreciation is primarily calculated on the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of related assets which range as follows: building 25 years, building\nimprovements 4 to 16 years, machinery 4 to 10 years, research and development equipment\n2 to 6 years, office furniture and equipment 3 to 8 years, others 2 to 10 years. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the\nestimated useful life of the asset. Embedded software is amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 15 years. Land is not depreciated.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then\nthey are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nF-21\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nDuring the year 2017, certain new machinery and equipment have been acquired for specific\nproject. The depreciation on these new assets is calculated on Fixed-Percentage-on-Declining-\nBase Method basis over the estimated useful lives of 3 years. The Company thinks that method\nwould most closely reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits\nembodied in those assets.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\n(j) Leases (policy applicable from January 1, 2019)\nThe Company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the\ncomparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and\nIFRIC 4. The details of the policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are described separately.\na. Identifying a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset, and the supplier does not have a\nsubstantive right to substitute the asset; and\n(ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from\nuse of the identified asset throughout the period of use; and\n(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the\nperiod of use.\nb. As a lessee\nPayments for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases are recognized as expenses\non a straight-line basis during the lease term for which the recognition exemption is\napplied. Except for leases described above, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability shall be\nrecognized for all other leases at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease\ncommencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the\nlease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company\ndetermines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external\nfinancing sources. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the\ninitial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the\ncommencement date, less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred\nand an estimate of costs to be incurred in restoring the underlying asset.\nF-22\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over\nthe shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term. The lease liability\nis subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is\nremeasured (i) if there is a change in the lease term; (ii) if there is a change in future lease\npayments arising from a change in an index or a rate; (iii) if there is a change in the amounts\nexpected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or (iv) if the Company changes its\nassessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When\nthe lease liability is remeasured in the circumstances aforementioned, a corresponding\nadjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. However, if the\ncarrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the\nremeasurement is recognized in profit or loss.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n(i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments.\n(ii) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise and lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is\nreasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\nMoreover, the lease liability is remeasured when lease modifications occur that decrease\nthe scope of the lease. The Company accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability\nby decreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full\ntermination of the lease and recognizes in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the\npartial or full termination of the lease.\nc. As a lessor\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating\nlease are added to the carrying amount of the asset leased.\nLeases (policy applicable before January 1, 2019)\nLeases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially\nall the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified operating\nleases.\nAs a lessee\nOperating lease payments were recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the\nterm of the lease.\nAs a lessor\nRental income from operating leases were recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the lease.\nF-23\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(k) Goodwill\nGoodwill is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net\nassets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated\nimpairment losses, if any.\nGoodwill from acquisition of Himax Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly Wisepal Technologies,\nInc., merged into Himax Technologies Limited on July 2, 2018) in 2007 amounting $26,846\nthousand has been assigned to Driver IC cash generating unit (“CGU”) and goodwill from\nacquisition of Himax Display (USA) Inc. in 2012 amounting $1,292 thousand has been\nassigned to WLO CGU because these CGUs are expected to benefit from the synergies of the\nbusiness combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU\nthat are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount\nof a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to\nreduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets\nof the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment\nloss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for\ngoodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In\nassessing value in use which was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial\nbudgets covering the future five-year period with the terminal growth rate. The annual\ndiscount rate was 13.3% and 18.28% in its test of Goodwill impairment for Driver IC CGU\nas of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, based on industry weighted average cost of\ncapital. The annual discount rate for WLO CGU was 16.07% and 15.41% as of December 31,\n2019 and 2020, respectively. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average\nTaiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.04% and 2.32%\nused in the test for both CGUs as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The key\nassumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the related\nindustry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\n(l) Other Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets include patents, intellectual property and developed technology\nacquired in a business combination. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-\nline basis over the following estimated useful lives: software 2-3 years, patents 12-15 years,\nintellectual property 10 years and technology 7 years.\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\nF-24\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(m) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company’s long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment\nand intangible assets, are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there is any\nindication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is\nestimated.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Considering the\nterminal growth rate if non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life are allocated to the\nCGU in comparison with its carrying amount.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use\nthat are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-\ngenerating unit, or CGU”).\nThe annual discount rate was 13.14% and 13.23% in its test of non-financial assets impairment\nwith an indefinite useful life for CMOS CGU as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively,\nbased on industry weighted average cost of capital. The terminal growth rate, based on\nfollowing 5 years average Taiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary\nFund, was 2.04% and 2.32% used in the test as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nThe key assumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for\nthe related industry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. When an\nimpairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU is increased\nto the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not\nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15, Revenue with contract customers\nretrospectively with practical expedient and transitional exemption. The Company is not\nrequired to restate contracts that were begin and end within the same annual reporting period.\nThere is no significant impact on the Company’s financial results in applying the practical\nexpedient.\nIFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with\ncustomers, using a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount of\nrevenue recognized. The Company generates revenue primarily from sale of goods or services.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated by primarily geographical market and\nmajor products.\nF-25\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company identifies the contract with the customers and recognizes revenue\nwhen performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled\nin the transfer of goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when\nit satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a\ncustomer. Customers obtain control of the product when the goods are delivered and accepted\nby customers. Invoices are generated at that point in time.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition from product sales is measured at the amount that is\nhighly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will\nnot occur. Revenue is reduced for estimated rebates and other similar allowances.\nTrade receivable is recognized when the Company is entitled for unconditional right to receive\npayment upon delivery of goods to customers. The consideration received in advance from the\ncustomer but without delivery of goods is recognized as a contract liability, for which revenue\nis recognized when the control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\nThe Company expects that the length of time when the Company transfers the goods or\nservices to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be less\nthan one year. Therefore, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the time value of\nmoney.\n(o) Employee Benefits\n1. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed unless another policy allows or requires it to be\ncapitalized. Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured\nat the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service\nrendered by employees.\n2. Share-based payment arrangements\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for share-based compensation is\nmeasured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments issued. The\ncost of employee services is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to employees\nand is recognized in earnings with a corresponding increase in equity over the service\nperiod by graded vesting. Compensation cost also considers the number of awards\nmanagement believes will eventually vest. As a result, compensation cost is reduced by the\nestimated forfeitures. The estimate is adjusted each period to reflect the current estimate of\nforfeitures, and finally, the actual number of awards that vest.\n3. Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nemployee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered\nby employees.\nF-26\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n4. Defined benefit plans\nThe Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated\nseparately for each benefit plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting\nthe fair value of any plan assets. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost\nof providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit\ncosts (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit\nretirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service\ncost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability\n(asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in profit or loss in the period they\noccur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan\nassets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in\nwhich they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected\nimmediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.\n(p) Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in profit or loss\nexcept to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in\nequity or in other comprehensive income.\n1. Current tax\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or\nlosses for the year and any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous\nyears. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted tax rate at the\nreporting date.\n2. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial\nstatements and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply\nto taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax\nrates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax\nassets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer\nprobable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the\nprobability of future taxable profits improves.\n(q) Business Combinations\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-related\ncosts are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess\nof the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the\nF-27\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nacquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over\nthe net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed. Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’\nproportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\nAny contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the\ncontingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is\naccounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration are recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and the resulting gain\nor loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n(r) Earnings Per Ordinary Share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is computed using profit or loss attributable to the\nshareholders and weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of\nordinary and diluted ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary\nequivalent shares are ordinary shares that are contingently issuable upon the vesting of\nunvested restricted share units (RSUs) and employee stock options granted to employees.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\nProfits (loss) attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders (in thousands) $ 8,569 (13,614) 47,134\nDenominator for basic earnings per ordinary share:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\n(in thousands) 345,020 345,101 345,708\nBasic earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders $ 0.02 (0.04) 0.14\nBasic earnings (loss) per ADS attributable to\nHimax Technologies,Inc. stockholders(2) $ 0.05 (0.08) 0.27\nContingently issuable ordinary shares underlying the unvested RSUs and employee stock options\ngranted to employees are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share based on\ntreasury stock method.\nF-28\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The number of ADS equivalent outstanding is\ndetermined by dividing the number of ordinary shares by two. Therefore, the weighted\naverage number of ADS equivalent outstanding used in basic earnings per ADS for 2018,\n2019 and 2020 is 172,510 thousand, 172,550 thousand and 172,854 thousand, respectively.\nAdditionally, the weighted average number of ADS equivalent outstanding used in diluted\nearnings per ADS for 2018, 2019 and 2020 is 172,534 thousand, 172,550 thousand and\n173,383 thousand, respectively. The earnings (loss) per ADS is presented solely for the\nconvenience of the reader and does not represent a measure under IFRS.\n(s) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses. All operating segments’ operating results\nare reviewed regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for\nwhich discrete financial information is available.\nThe Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who regularly\nreviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing\nperformance for the Company. Management has determined that the Company has two\noperating segments: Driver IC and Non-driver products.\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on segment sales and\nsegment profit and loss. There are no intersegment sales in the segment revenues reported to\nthe CODM.

If a change in ownership of a\nconsolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership\ninterests are re-measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings.\n(u) Use of Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to\naccounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any\nfuture periods affected.\nInformation about critical judgments, estimates and assumptions in applying accounting\npolicies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated\nfinancial statements is included in the following notes:\n1. Valuation of inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses\njudgment and estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each\nreporting period.\nDue to the rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value of\ninventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then\nwrites down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific\ntime horizon.\n2. Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of non-financial assets other than\ngoodwill, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\nindependent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to\nthe specific asset groups. Any changes in these estimates based on changed economic\nconditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal\nin future years.\nF-30\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Recognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits\nwill be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of\nthe realization of the deferred tax assets requires the Company’s subjective judgment and\nestimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, the sources of taxable\nincome, the amount of tax credits that can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies.\nChanges in the economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations\nmay result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n4. Impairment of goodwill\nThe assessment of impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make subjective\njudgment to determine the identified CGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and\nestimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating the\nrecoverable amount of relevant CGU, the Company is required to make subjective\njudgments in determining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent\ncash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nNote 5.

The\nselected discount rate considers the risk and nature of the comparative companies and the rates\nof return market participants would require to investing their capital in reporting units.\nThe acquired intangible assets, the core and developed technology, will be amortized based on\na weighted-average useful life of approximately 7 years.

Sensitivity analysis\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises from the translation of the foreign\ncurrency exchange gains and losses on cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other\nreceivable, accounts payable, other payable and lease liabilities that are denominated in foreign\ncurrency.\nDepreciation or appreciation of the USD by 10% against the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) , CNY\nand JPY at December 31, 2019 and 2020, while all other variables were remained constant,\nwould have increased or (decreased) the net profit before tax of $2,000 thousand and $3,330\nthousand, respectively.\niii. Interest rate risk\nThe Company’s short-term secured borrowings and long-term unsecured borrowings carried\nfloating interest rates and fixed interest rates. The Company’s exposure to changes in interest\nrates is mainly from floating-rate borrowings. Any change in interest rates will cause the\neffective interest rates of borrowings to change and thus cause the future cash flows to\nfluctuate over time.\nThe following sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to interest rate risk.\nFor floating-rate debts, the analysis assumes that the balances of outstanding debts at the end\nof the reporting period had been outstanding for the entire year.\nFor the Company’s floating-rate debts, assuming all other variables were remained constant,\nan increase or a decrease in the interest rate by 0.25% would have resulted in a decrease or an\nincrease in the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 by $336\nthousand and $146 thousand, respectively.\nF-64\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The fair\nvalue using valuation techniques refers to the current fair value of other financial\ninstruments with similar conditions and characteristics, or using a discounted cash flow\nmethod, or other valuation techniques which include model calculating with observable\nmarket data at the reporting date.\nF-65\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

Financial Risk Management\n(a) Overview\nThe Company is exposed to the following risks due to usage of financial instruments:\n(1) Credit risk\n(2) Liquidity risk\n(3) Market risk\nHereinafter discloses information about the Company’s exposure to variable risks, and the\ngoals, policies and procedures of the Company’s risk measurement and risk management.\n(b) Risk management framework\nManagement of related divisions are appointed to review, control, trace and monitor the\nstrategic risks, financial risks and operational risks faced by the Company. Management\nreports to executive officers the progress of risk controls from time to time and, if necessary,\nreport to the board of directors, depending on the extent of impact of risks.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a\nfinancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposures to\ncredit risk are primarily from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost\nand accounts receivable.\nThe Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with various reputable financial\ninstitutions. Financial assets at amortized cost are time deposits with original maturities\nof greater than three months. The Company has not experienced any material losses on\ndeposits of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and financial assets at amortized cost.\nManagement performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial\ninstitutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. Management\nbelieves that there is a limited concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalent and\nfinancial assets at amortized cost.\nThe Company derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of display drivers that are\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions and subject to price fluctuations. Management\ncontinuously evaluates and controls the credit quality, credit limit and financial strength of its\ncustomers to ensure any overdue receivables are taken necessary procedures.\nThe Company depends on three customers for majority of its revenues. The Company’s sales\nto these three customers as a percentage of revenues are as follows:\nF-67\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018 2019 2020\nCustomer A and its affiliates 28.1% 29.5% 32.6%\nCustomer B and its affiliates 12.6% 8.9% 6.6%\nCustomer C 5.7% 5.6% 12.7%\nThe percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable accounted by customers, those\nrepresenting more than 10% of total accounts receivable balance, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2019 2020\nCustomer A and its affiliates 37.7% 36.3%\nCustomer B and its affiliates 7.9% 8.2%\nCustomer C 5.8% 13.6%\nRefer to Note 11 for aging analysis of accounts receivable and the movement in the loss\nallowance.\nIn addition, the Company has at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of\nits customers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment terms, and the\nCompany may grant such requests for extension in the future. As a result, a default by any\nsuch customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable, or the extension\nof payment terms for the Company’s customers could adversely affect the Company’s cash\nflow, liquidity and operating results. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of\neach customer and adjusts credit policy based upon payment history and the customer’s\ncredit worthiness, as determined by the review of their current credit information.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity\nto fund its business requirements associated with existing operations over the next 12\nmonths. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate working capital\nand unused credit facilities.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company’s working capital together with existing unused credit\nfacilities under its existing loan agreements will be sufficient to fulfill all of its contractual\nobligations. Therefore, management believes that there is no liquidity risk resulting from\nincapable of financing to fulfill the contractual obligations.\n(e) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and\ninterest rates, will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial\ninstruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\nF-68\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020\n(1) Currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on operating activities that are denominated in\na currency other than the respective functional currency of the Company, the USD. The\ncurrencies used in these transactions are the NTD, CNY and JPY.\n(2) Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its outstanding\nborrowings. The Company’s borrowings carried floating interest rates. To manage the\ninterest rate risk, the Company periodically assesses the interest rates of bank loans\nand maintains good relationships with financial institutions to obtain lower financing\ncosts. The Company also strengthens the management of working capital to reduce the\ndependence on bank loans as well as the risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\nNote 25. Capital management\nThrough clear understanding and managing of significant changes in external environment, related\nindustry characteristics, and corporate growth plan, the Company manages its capital structure\nin a manner to ensure it has sufficient financial resources to fund its working capital needs,\ncapital expenditures, research and development activities, dividend payments and other business\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.

          "content": "Dear Shareholders,\nLooking back on 2019, Himax Technologies continued to drive the evolution of innovation as a leader in the\nindustry. We remain committed to investing across all our product categories for the long-term and this has\nestablished Himax in a position of strength in the global marketplace. As we move forward, we are dedicated\nto quality, reliability, and execution to deliver shareholder value.\nThere were several obstacles that negatively impacted the business but as we reached the end of the year,\nwe began to see a turnaround across all of our businesses with positive momentum and outlook. At the time,\nthis was due to design-wins with new and existing customers across our major product lines. This positive\nmomentum, combined with our expanded foundry capacity, provides confidence for better results in 2020.\nToday, due to Covid-19, the marketplace faces unprecedented challenges. Although we have limited visibility\nin the short-term, Himax is well positioned to benefit from industry trends. Given this uncertain economic\nenvironment, we look forward with cautious optimism that we can regain our business momentum as we\nemerge from the current crisis.\nNow, let me review the year for each of our business segments.\nThe overall display driver IC businesses declined in 2019 as a result of weak TV demand, increased cost and\ncompetition, and the impacts of short-term capacity constraints on TDDI. Yet we feel our product roadmap\ncombined with TDDI foundry capacity, new design wins, a more diverse customer base and new technology,\nposition Himax for better results in 2020 and long-term growth.\nIn 2019, our large panel driver IC business declined, primarily due to panel makers correcting inventory from\nweak TV demand, increased costs of packaging material and industry-wide oversupply, all of which resulted\nin lower shipments and price erosion. As we look to 2020, market dynamics have shifted as panel makers\nreplenish their inventories. Our leading Chinese panel customers have moved quickly to take advantage of\nongoing fab restructuring by the Korean panel makers. Additionally, we expanded our foundry capacity last\nyear ahead of our peers, a move that has put us in a good position to gain market share and grow our large\npanel business. Our design project coverage across all leading Chinese panel makers remains strong and\nwhile the TV market has been hard-hit by the pandemic, we are seeing strength in monitor and notebook\nmarkets thanks to our product excellence especially in the high-end monitor and low-power notebook\nmarkets.\nWe also experienced a decline in the small and medium-sized driver IC business during 2019 due to increased\ncompetition that led to smartphone TDDI price erosion as well as more TDDI shipments for the lower-end\nmarket which also contributed to the decline. However, on a full-year basis, TDDI shipments were close to\ndouble compared to 2018. Looking forward at the smartphone market, a move to higher frame rate displays\nand demand for 5G in China are expected to drive smartphone growth. Himax is well positioned to benefit\nfrom these trends. Turning to the tablet business, we see the opportunity for strong growth from the rapid\nadoption of in-cell TDDI solution as it is becoming mainstream for tablets due to lower cost. Moving on\nto automotive applications, revenue fell due to sluggish global car sales and a maturing automotive display\nmarket. While we did not enjoy the same kind of growth from automotive display segment as we did in 2018,\nHimax commands more than 30% of the global automotive display driver IC market and is a dominant new\ntechnology provider in TDDI, AMOLED, and local dimming timing controller. We are well positioned to\ncapture the long-term growth to be driven by these new technologies in the automotive market.\nIn the non-driver IC business segment during 2019, we continued to ship multimillion units of our WLO\nproduct to an anchor customer, although the demand for this product is likely to decline significantly starting\nthe second quarter of 2020. Despite the short-term disruption, we continue to make progress with our\nongoing R&D projects for the next generation products centered around our exceptional design know-how\nand mass production expertise in WLO technology. Looking at 3D sensing for smartphones, we have been\nworking with an industry-leading ToF 3D camera vendor to develop new and advanced solutions, targeting\nAndroid smartphones, and are pleased to have provided a spot projector for reference design together with\nthis partner. For non-smartphone 3D-sensing, our engagements continue to focus on smart door lock and\n1\nindustrial automation applications where we provide structured light-based total solutions. In the area of\nultralow power smart sensing, we see opportunities across multiple consumer product categories and continue\nto collaborate with customers and ecosystem partners who would like to leverage our WiseEye technology, a\ncutting-edge AI-based ultralow power intelligent sensing solution, in next generation applications.\nAs we look forward to 2020, Covid-19 has had a profound impact on global consumption and the economy\noverall. Although we have limited visibility at this time, as the economy moves past the crisis, we believe we\nare well positioned to benefit from industry trends and economy rebound. We hold a leadership position in\nthe markets we serve and remain dedicated to establishing forward-looking long-term value for shareholders.\nI am grateful for the support of our shareholders, customers, partners, and employees, and look forward with\nconfidence to having a great year in 2020.\nSincerely,\nJordan Wu\nPresident and CEO\nHimax Technologies, Inc.\n2\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 20-F\n(Mark One)\nREGISTRATION STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(b) OR (g) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nOR\nx ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019\nOR\nTRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the transition period from ________________ to ________________\nOR\nSHELL COMPANY REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nDate of event requiring this shell company report ________________\nCommission file number: 000-51847\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)\nNot Applicable\n(Translation of Registrant’s name into English)\nCAYMAN ISLANDS\n(Jurisdiction of incorporation or organization)\nNO. 26, ZIH LIAN ROAD\nSINSHIH DISTRICT, TAINAN CITY 74148\nTAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n(Address of principal executive offices)\nJackie Chang\nChief Financial Officer\nTelephone: +886-2-2370-3999\nE-mail: jackie_chang@himax.com.tw\nFacsimile: +886-2-2314-0877\n10F, No. 1, Xiangyang Road\nTaipei 10046\nTaiwan, Republic of China\n(Name, Telephone, E-mail and/or Facsimile number and Address of Company Contact Person)\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act:\nTitle of each class Trading Symbol Name of each exchange on which\nregistered\nOrdinary Shares, par value $0.3 per HIMX The NASDAQ Global Select\nordinary share Market Inc.*\n* Not for trading, but only in connection with the listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, Inc. of American Depositary Shares 3\nrepresenting such Ordinary Shares.\nSecurities registered or to be registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Act: None\nSecurities for which there is a reporting obligation pursuant to\nSection 15(d) of the Act: None\nIndicate the number of outstanding shares of each of the issuer’s classes of capital or common stock as of the\nclose of the period covered by the annual report. 344,368,062 Ordinary Shares.\nIndicate by check mark if the registrant is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 of the\nSecurities Act. x Yes No\nIf this report is an annual or transition report, indicate by check mark if the registrant is not required to file\nreports pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Reason for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\n3.D. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Business\nOur suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation, which could result\nin an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.\nThere has been an increased level of industry consolidation among our suppliers. Merger and acquisition\nactivities will likely increase the size and market power of the relevant suppliers and reduce the number of\nsuppliers we could use under a simpler supplier chain. Such industry change could further reduce the number\nof suppliers for gold bumping, COF packages services and Tape that we could use. Therefore, suppliers could\nbe in a better position to bargain for higher prices for their services and products, which could result in an\nincrease in our average unit cost. Moreover, as gold is a crucial raw material in the gold bumping process,\nany increases in the price of gold could result in an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our\nprofit margin. If we are unable to transfer any increase in average unit cost to our customers by selling at\n12\nhigher prices, our gross margin would decrease, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-LCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical\nand subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price fluctuations could negatively impact our business\nor results of operations.\nIn 2018 and 2019, 81.0% and 81.1% of our revenues, respectively, were attributable to display drivers\nthat were incorporated into TFT-LCD panels. We expect to continue to substantially depend on sales to the\nTFT-LCD panel industry for the foreseeable future. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The average selling prices of TFT-LCD panels generally\ndecline with time as a result of, among other factors, capacity ramp-up, technological advancements and cost\nreduction with the exception of the new high end and high-resolution products. The average selling prices of\nTFT-LCD panels could further decline for numerous reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n• lower-than-expected demand for end-use products that incorporate TFT-LCD panels;\n• a surge in industrial manufacturing capacity due to the ramping up of new fabrication facilities and/\nor improvements in production yields; and\n• manufacturers operating at high levels of capacity utilization in order to reduce fixed costs per panel.\nThe TFT-LCD panel industry is volatile and difficult to predict. For example, in 2014, the smartphone\nboom in developed markets and in China generated great demand of small and medium sized panels, helping\nthe TFT-LCD panel business to gradually recover. However, 2015 was a more challenging year for the TFT-\nLCD industry due to macro uncertainties and soft demand across the consumer electronics sectors. We cannot\nassure you that such similar events will not occur in the future or there will not be any future shortages\nof materials or components for our products or our customers’ products or a decrease in demand for our\nproducts.\nIn addition, the merger of certain of our major customers, including CMO, Innolux and TPO in 2010,\ncould result in an increase in their bargaining power and therefore subject us to additional downward pricing\npressure. We cannot assure you that in such periods in which we experience significant downward pricing\npressure, we could sufficiently reduce costs to completely offset the loss of revenues. In addition, a severe and\nprolonged industry downturn could also result in higher risks in relation to the collectability of our accounts\nreceivable, the marketability and valuation of our inventories, the impairment of our tangible and intangible\nassets, and the stability of our supply chain. As a result, the cyclicality of the TFT-LCD panel industry could\nadversely affect our revenues, cost of revenues and results of operations.\nOur strategy of expanding our product offerings to non-driver products may not be successful.\nWe have devoted, and intend to continue to devote, financial and management resources to the\ndevelopment, manufacturing and marketing of non-driver products as we diversify our product portfolio and\nbecause our non-driver products have higher gross margin than our driver products. Our non-driver products\ninclude, among others, timing controllers, touch panel controllers, LCOS and MEMS microdisplays, power\nmanagement ICs, CMOS image sensors, wafer level optics (WLO) products, 3D sensing solution and ultra-\nlow power smart sensing.\nWe believe end products utilizing our LCOS technology could potentially be a large market and we have\nmade major progress toward commercialization of LCOS microdisplays for head-mounted-display. On top\nof that, we have seen supply chain maturing throughout the years with a growing number of significant\nplayers investing in microdisplay reference designs. Our LCOS microdisplay business hit on inflection\npoint in September 2015 with pilot production shipment made to a major customer. Since then, we have\nincreased shipments of our LCOS products to some industry heavyweights and secured additional design\nengagements with current and new customers. Some of our major customers already launched their products\nin 2016. At present, our main focus areas for LCOS business are AR goggle devices and head-up-displays\n13\n(HUD) for automotive, while AR will take a few years to fully realize its market potential. We continue to\nsee heavyweight companies allocating major R&D resources and budgets to bring the new products into\nthe market. Tier 1 companies and start-up companies are investing heavily to develop the ecosystem --\napplications, software, OS, firmware, system electronics, and optics. With all these investments, we will see\nan ecosystem build up within the next few years; the AR market will then be in an acceleration mode. While\nmost customers don’t expect big volume for their early generation products, we have been working with\nmany of them for future generation devices. We are committed to providing the best technology to support\nthem in the effort. We are also seeing constant additions of new customers using our LCOS for a variety of\nnew applications. We believe that Himax stands to benefit from our customers’ successful commercialization\nof their new products due to our unique position as one of the providers of choice for microdisplay and\nrelated optics. Nevertheless, these product categories are at a relatively early stage as compared to other\nproducts and they have a relatively immature supply chain. Therefore, it is difficult to project the success of\nthe applications that use LCOS microdisplay products.\nWe also believe there are new market opportunities for our CMOS image sensors. Although it seems\nrelatively challenging for us to gain significant market share in conventional RGB camera, we do think\nthere are various interesting and different applications in imaging. On top of our legacy products in laptop\nand multimedia, we’ve developed two technologies for computer vision, i.e., near infrared (“NIR”) sensor\nand Always-on-Sensor (“AoS”). NIR sensor is a building stone for passive as well as active computer\nvision system. With the special design in pixel architecture and materials, our NIR sensor provides industry\nleading Quantum Efficiency (“QE”) to absorb NIR signal. AoS, on the other hand, is a specific sensor\nwhich consumes only several micro watts to do people detection, eye ball tracking, and other cool features.\nNew sensor architectures, readout, pixel, and the corresponding slim algorithms are integrated together to\ncontribute the always-on feature. Himax is the industry leader in these two new technologies. Given that\nthe two new exciting product lines just hit the market, it’s still quite new to the industry. To build up the\ncompetition barrier, we have also devoted ourselves and pour a lot of resources into making the product lines\nmore mature. As a result, these two new products take time to bear some fruits.\nMoreover, we continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing 3D sensing projects\ncovering structured light and time-of-flight (ToF). However, in 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing\nsolution targeting Android smartphone’s front-facing application was unsuccessful due to high hardware\ncost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time required to integrate it into the smartphone and the lack\nof killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and online payment. Instead of 3D sensing, most of\nthe Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost finger print technology which can achieve similar\nphone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised user experience. Since 2019, we\nare seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone makers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced\nphotography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D depth information generation for AR. We have\nbeen actively working with an industry leading ToF 3D camera vendor to develop a new and advanced ToF\nsolution, targeting Android smartphones. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we have made great progress\nproviding the partner with spot projector for their reference design which will be ready for leading Android\nsmartphone makers’ evaluation as soon as first quarter of 2020.\nWe reported at second quarter of 2019 earnings call on August 7, 2019, we have also adjusted our\nstructured light-based 3D sensing technology development to focus on applications for non-smartphone\nsegments which are typically less sensitive to cost and always require a total solution.\nOur non-smartphone 3D-sensing engagements have focused on smart door lock and industrial automation\nsegments where we provide structured light-based 3D sensing total solution. We have been collaborating\nclosely with two main types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial recognition algorithm\nand those offering application processors with strong AI capability. We have started design-in projects with\nseveral smart door lock end customers. Separately, we are working with partners who wish to take advantage\nof our 3D sensing know-how to automate traditional manufacturing to improve efficiency and reducing cost.\nOne market opportunity we are pursuing is shoe factory automation. The prototypes of 3D sensing enabled\nautomatic robotic cementing system are available now for production optimization testing.\n14\nOur WiseEye solution contains Himax’s industry leading CMOS image sensor and ASIC designs with\nEmza’s AI-based algorithm. All with low power features. WiseEye will enable next generation AI-based\ncomputer vision technology with ultra-low power for notebook and many other markets. Additionally,\nour new product WiseEye WE-I plus, as an edge AI computing platform solution, is aggressively joining\nthis edge computing ecosystem by closely working with machine learning framework provider, tool chain\ndevelopers, AI algorithm developers and OEM/ODM to provide flexible and cost-effective solutions to fulfill\nthis booming but diversified market.\nDeveloping and commercializing each of our non-driver products requires a significant amount of\nmanagement, engineering and monetary resources. For example, we have established certain in-house\nfacilities for key manufacturing processes of our non-driver products including LCOS microdisplay\nsolutions, wafer-level optics and active alignment for 3D sensing. If we are unable to efficiently ramp up\nour production facilities or lack of customers’ demand, the lower capacity utilization rate will negatively\naffect our gross margin and our results of operations. Moreover, we will be subject to ramp-up expenses in\nthe early stage of mass production of our non-driver products. Numerous uncertainties exist in developing\nnew products and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our non-driver products successfully.\nWe may underestimate the amount of capital, personnel and other resources required to develop and\ncommercialize our non-driver products, which may affect the success of our growth strategy. We may\nalso overestimate the market potential of the end products that are utilizing or will utilize our non-driver\nproducts, which may negatively impact our strategy for the development of non-driver products. In addition,\nif we are unsuccessful in expanding our product offerings to non-driver products, it may negatively affect\nour reputation and the status of our brand in our other markets. The failure or delay in the development,\nproduction or commercialization of any of our non-driver products, the occurrence of any product defects or\ndesign flaws, or the low market acceptance of or demand for either of our products or the end devices using\nour products may adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe concentration of our accounts receivable and the extension of payment terms for certain of our\ncustomers exposes us to increased credit risk and could harm our operating results and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our accounts receivable from Customer A and its affiliates were $62.1 million,\nwhich represented approximately 37.7% of our accounts receivable, net. The concentration of our accounts\nreceivable exposes us to increased credit risk. Moreover, we have at times agreed to extend the payment\nterms for certain of our customers. Other customers have also requested extensions of payment terms. We\nmay also agree to grant such requests for the extension of payment terms in the future. As a result, a default\nby any such customer, a prolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable or the extension of payment\nterms for our customers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results.\nOur customers may experience a decline in profitability or may not be profitable at all, which could adversely\naffect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe TFT-LCD panel industry is highly competitive. TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, including our\ncustomers, experience significant pressure on prices and profit margins, due largely to growing industry\ncapacity and fluctuations in demand for TFT-LCD panels. Some TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have\ngreater access to capital or greater production, research and development, intellectual property, marketing or\nother resources than our customers, who may not be able to compete successfully and sustain their market\npositions. In addition, our customers’ business performance may fluctuate significantly due to a number of\nfactors, many of which are beyond their control, including:\n• consumer demand and the general economic conditions;\n• the cyclical nature of both the TFT-LCD industry, including fluctuations in average selling prices,\nand its downstream industries;\n15\n• the speed at which TFT-LCD panel manufacturers expand production capacity;\n• brand companies’ continued needs for original equipment manufacturing services provided by TFT-\nLCD panel manufacturers;\n• access to raw materials, components, equipment and utilities on a timely and economical basis;\n• technological changes;\n• the rescheduling and cancellation of large orders;\n• access to funding on satisfactory terms; and\n• fluctuations in the currencies of TFT-LCD panels exporting countries against the U.S. dollar.\nOur customers continued to operate in a challenging business environment and may experience a decline\nin profitability or may not be profitable at all. In addition, the aggressive expansion plans for next generation\nfabs in China proposed by several TFT-LCD panel manufacturers might significantly increase the output of\nTFT-LCD panels if all of the plans are implemented in the next few years, which could result in a decline in\nthe average selling prices of TFT-LCD panels. In addition, the antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and the European\nUnion against several TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have materially and adversely affected the profitability\nof certain of our customers, which could, in turn, adversely affect our profit margin, significantly reduce our\nprofits and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on sales of display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, and the limited potential for further growth in\nboth the market size of display drivers and the market share of our display drivers or the absence of continued\nmarket acceptance of our display drivers could limit our growth in revenues or harm our business.\nIn 2018 and 2019, we derived 81.0% and 81.1% of our revenues, respectively, from the sale of display\ndrivers used for large-sized applications, mobile handset applications and consumer electronics applications,\nand we expect to continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these or related products.\nAs the display driver industry and our display driver business are relatively mature, there may be limited\npotential for the overall display drivers market to grow and for us to further grow our market share, which\ncould limit our future growth in revenues.\nFailure to grow our unit shipments for display drivers, coupled with a general decline in the average\nselling prices, could adversely and materially affect our results of operations. See also “—Risks Relating\nto Our Industry—The average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively\nimpact our revenues and operating results.” We expect to continue deriving a substantial portion of our\nrevenues from the sale of display drivers. Therefore, the continued market acceptance of our display drivers\nis critical to our future success. Failure to grow or maintain our revenues generated from the sales of display\ndrivers could adversely and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnological innovation may reduce the number of display drivers typically required for each panel,\nthereby reducing the number of display drivers we are able to sell per panel. If such a reduction in\ndemand is not offset by the general growth of the industry, growth in our market share or an increase in\nour average selling prices, our revenues may decline.\nWith the high penetration rate of smartphones, growth of the market has been slowing down in the past\nyears. LCD display and its driver IC in smartphone application is getting more commoditized with lower\nASP. Meanwhile, addressable market size of conventional smartphone DDIC is eroded quickly by AMOLED\nand in-cell TDDIs, which used to be emerging technologies but have ramped up with significant adoption\nrate. Being one of the leading DDIC suppliers, Himax also has been devoted to development activities for\nAMOLED DDIC and in-cell TDDIs. Himax TDDI for smartphone has gone through the learning curve\nsince 2016 and have doubled in 2019. However, the AMOLED for smartphone keep penetrating from\n16\nhigh-end to mid-end market to compete in-cell LCD with TDDI. The smartphone market continues to\nembrace new technologies and are moving toward higher frame rate displays to enable smoother screen\nviewing and gaming experience. This will drive the adoption of next generation high frame rate TDDI\nsolutions, for which Himax is a leading technology provider. Also, industry research indicates that the\ndemand for 5G in China is expected to drive worldwide smartphone growth in 2020 which will in turn\nstimulate the growth for TDDI. All these trends will benefit Himax.\nAMOLED display and related DDICs have been dominated by Korean companies. The marketplace is\nincreasing utilization of the OLED display for smartphone. This is due to expanded AMOLED capacity as\nwell as increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED\ndisplay for the time being. We are encouraged by the progress we have made, collaborating closely with\nleading panel makers across China for AMOLED product development. We believe AMOLED driver ICs\nwill soon become one of the major growth engines for our small panel driver IC business.\nExcept for certain small-sized panels, multiple display drivers are typically required for each panel to\nfunction. In order to reduce costs, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers generally seek to have display drivers\nwith higher channel counts and new panel designs to reduce the number of display drivers required for each\npanel. We have been developing such innovative and cost-effective display driver solutions in order to grow\nour market share, attract additional customers, increase our average selling prices and capture new design\nwins. However, we cannot assure you that we will successfully achieve these goals. If we fail to do so and\nthe number of display drivers typically required per panel decreases thereby reducing our unit shipments, our\nrevenues may decline. TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have developed several panel designs to reduce the\nusage of display drivers, including gate in panel, or GIP, amorphous silicon gate, or ASG, or simply gateless\ndesigns, which integrate the gate driver function onto the glass and eliminate the need for gate drivers, as well\nas dual gate and triple gate panel designs, which would largely reduce the usage of source drivers. If such\ndesigns or technologies become widely adopted, demand for our display drivers may decrease significantly,\nwhich would adversely and materially affect our results of operations.\nWe face numerous challenges relating to our growth. If we are no longer able to keep our\ncompetitiveness to maintain current market share or to gain market share in new product segments, our\nrevenues and profit may decline.\nThe scope and complexity of our business has grown significantly since our inception. Our growth has\nplaced, and will continue to place, a strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. If we are\nunable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities,\nexecute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. To successfully manage our growth, we\nbelieve we must effectively:\n• hire, train, integrate, retain and manage additional qualified engineers, senior managers, sales and\nmarketing personnel, and information technology personnel;\n• implement additional, and improve existing, administrative and operations systems, procedures and\ncontrols;\n• expand our accounting and internal audit team, including hiring additional personnel with IFRS and\ninternal control expertise;\n• continue to expand and upgrade our design and product development capabilities;\n• manage multiple relationships with semiconductor manufacturing service providers, customers,\nsuppliers and certain other third parties; and\n• continue to develop and commercialize non-driver products, including, among others, timing controllers,\ntouch controller ICs, LCOS and MEMS microdisplays, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors,\nwafer level optics (WLO) products, 3D sensing solution and ultra-low power smart sensing.\n17\nMoreover, if our allocation of resources does not correspond with future demand for particular products,\nwe could miss market opportunities, and our business and financial results could be materially and adversely\naffected. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our growth effectively in the future.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict, and if we do not meet quarterly\nfinancial expectations, our ADS price will likely decline.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict. They have fluctuated in the past from\nquarter to quarter and may continue to do so in the future. Our operating results may in some quarters fall\nbelow market expectations, likely causing our ADS price to decline. Our quarterly revenues and operating\nresults may fluctuate because of many factors, including:\n• our ability to accurately forecast shipments, average selling prices, cost of revenues, operating expenses,\nnon-operating income/loss, foreign currency exchange rates, and effective income tax rates;\n• our ability to transfer any increase in unit costs to our customers;\n• our ability to accurately perform various tests, estimations and projections, including with respect to the\nwrite-down on slow or obsolete inventories, the impairment of non-financial assets, the collectability of\naccounts receivable, and the realization of deferred tax assets;\n• our ability to successfully design, develop and introduce new or enhanced products acceptable to our\ncustomers in a timely manner;\n• changes in the relative mix in the unit shipments of our products, which may have significantly different\naverage selling prices and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues;\n• our ability to efficiently ramp-up in-house manufacturing facilities;\n• changes in share-based compensation;\n• the loss of one or more of our key customers;\n• decreases in the average selling prices of our products;\n• our accumulation and write-down of inventory;\n• the relative unpredictability in the volume and timing of customer orders;\n• shortages of other components used in the manufacture of TFT-LCD panels;\n• the risk of cancellation or deferral of customer orders in anticipation of our new products or product\nenhancements, or due to a reduction in demand of our customers’ end product;\n• changes in our payment terms with our customers and our suppliers;\n• our ability to negotiate favorable prices with customers and suppliers;\n• changes in the available capacity of semiconductor manufacturing service providers;\n• the rate at which new markets emerge for new products under development;\n• the evolution of industry standards and technologies;\n• product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;\n18\n• increase in cost of revenues due to inflation;\n• our involvement in litigation or other types of disputes;\n• changes in general economic conditions, especially the impact of the global financial crisis on\neconomic growth and consumer spending, and the unease in the Middle East;\n• changes our transfer pricing policy and applicable income tax regulations; and\n• natural disasters, particularly earthquakes and typhoons, or outbreaks of disease affecting countries\nwhere we conduct our business or where our products are manufactured, assembled or tested.\nThe factors listed above are difficult to foresee, and along with other factors, could seriously harm our\nbusiness. We anticipate the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our operating\nexpenses and inventory levels are based on our expectations of future revenues, and our operating expenses\nare relatively fixed in the short term. Consequently, if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter do\nnot occur as expected, operating expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, and our\noperating results for that quarter and, potentially, future quarters may be negatively impacted. Any shortfall\nin our revenues would directly impact our business. Our operating results are volatile and difficult to\npredict; therefore, you should not rely on the operating results of any one quarter as indicative of our future\nperformance. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts\nand investors. In this event, our ADS price may decline significantly.\nThe strategic relationships between certain of our competitors and their customers and the development\nof in-house capabilities by TFT-LCD panel manufacturers may limit our ability to expand our customer\nbase and our growth prospects.\nCertain of our competitors have established or may establish strategic or strong relationships with TFT-\nLCD panel manufacturers that are also our existing or potential customers. Marketing our display drivers to\nsuch TFT-LCD panel manufacturers that have established relationships with our competitors may be difficult.\nMoreover, several TFT-LCD panel manufacturers have in-house design capabilities and therefore may not\nneed to source semiconductor products from us. If our customers successfully develop in-house capabilities\nto design and develop semiconductors that can substitute for our products, they would likely reduce or\nstop purchasing our products. In addition, we also face challenges in attracting new customers for our new\nproducts. To sell new products, we will likely need to target new market segments and new customers\nwith whom we do not have current relationships, which may require different strategies and may present\ndifficulties that we have not encountered before. Therefore, failure to broaden our customer base and attract\nnew customers may limit our growth prospects.\nWe depend primarily on nine foundries to manufacture our wafers, and any failure to obtain sufficient\nfoundry capacity or loss of any of the foundries we use could significantly delay our ability to ship our\nproducts, causing us to lose revenues and damage our customer relationships.\nAccess to foundry capacity is crucial to our business because we do not manufacture our own wafers,\ninstead relying primarily on nine third-party foundries. The ability of a foundry to manufacture our\nsemiconductor products is limited by its available capacity. Access to capacity is especially important due to\nthe limited availability of the high-voltage CMOS process technology required for the manufacture of wafers\nused in display drivers. Moreover, Japanese integrated device manufacturer companies may outsource their\nsemiconductor manufacturing to foundries outside Japan. This could result in tightness in the foundry supply\navailable to us and affect our ability to acquire sufficient capacity. As we currently do not have any long-\nterm supply arrangements with any third-party foundries to guarantee us access to a certain level of foundry\ncapacity, if the primary third-party foundries that we rely upon are not able to meet our required capacity, or\nif our business relationships with these foundries are adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the\nrequired capacity from these foundries to meet any increasing demand for our products and would have to\nseek alternative foundries, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or which\n19\nmay expose us to risks associated with qualifying new foundries, as further discussed below. Our results of\noperations and business prospects could be adversely affected as a result of the foregoing.\nWe place wafer orders on the basis of our customers’ purchase orders and sales forecasts; however, any\nof the foundries we use can allocate capacity to other foundry customers and reduce deliveries to us on short\nnotice. It could be that other foundry customers are larger and better financed than we are or have supply\nagreements or better relationships with the foundries we use and could induce these foundries to reallocate\nour capacity to them. The loss of any of the foundries we use or any shortfall in available foundry capacity\ncould impair our ability to secure processed wafers, which could significantly delay our ability to ship our\nproducts, causing a loss of revenues and damages to our customer relationships.\nAlthough we use several foundries for different semiconductor products, certain of our products are\nmanufactured at only one of these foundries. If any one of the foundries that we use for a specific product\nis unable to provide us with our required capacity, does not deliver in a timely manner, or the quality or\npricing terms are not acceptable to us, we could experience significant delays in receiving the product\nbeing manufactured for us by that foundry or incur additional costs to obtain substitutes. Also, if any of the\nfoundries that we use experience financial difficulties or insolvency risks due to the impact of the global\neconomic turmoil or any company-specific reasons or otherwise, if their operations are damaged or if there\nis any other disruption of their foundry operations, we may not be able to qualify an alternative foundry in\na timely manner. If we choose to use a new foundry or process technology for a particular semiconductor\nproduct, we believe that it will take us several quarters to qualify the new foundry or process before we can\nbegin shipping such products. If we cannot qualify a new foundry in a timely manner, we may experience a\nsignificant interruption in our supply of the affected products, which could reduce our revenues, increase our\ncosts and expenses, and damage our customer relationships.\nThe fluctuations in the prices of certain metals, chemicals and gasoline and the volatility of foreign\nexchange rates may have increased costs for foundries and semiconductor service providers. This increase in\ncosts could limit their ability to continue to make the research and development investments needed to keep\nup with technological advances. Any increase in costs for foundries and semiconductor service providers we\nuse could lead to an increase in our unit costs or could limit our ability to lower our unit costs. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to continue to reduce our costs and maintain our profit margins.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and Vanguard International\nSemiconductor Corporation, or Vanguard, historically manufactured substantially all of our wafers in the\nearly years since our inception. In order to diversify our foundry sources, we have also used Macronix\nInternational Co., Ltd., or Macronix, Nexchip Semiconductor Corporation, or Nexchip Globalfoundries\nSingapore Pte., Ltd. (formerly Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd.), or Globalfoundries Singapore,\nUnited Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or\nPSMC, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, and SK hynix system ic or\nSKHYSI to manufacture a portion of our products. As a result of outsourcing the manufacturing of our\nwafers, we face several significant risks, including:\n• failure to secure necessary manufacturing capacity, or being able to obtain required capacity only at\nhigher costs;\n• risks of our proprietary information leaking to our competitors through the foundries we use;\n• limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and control, manufacturing yields and\nproduction costs;\n• the unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies; and\n• financial risks of certain of our foundry suppliers, including those that are owned by ailing dynamic\nrandom access memory, or DRAM, companies.\n20\nIn addition, in order to manufacture our display drivers used in TFT-LCD panels, we require foundries\nwith high-voltage manufacturing process capacity. Of the limited number of foundries that offer this\ncapability, some are owned by integrated device manufacturers which are also our competitors. As a result,\nour dependence on high-voltage foundries presents the following additional risks:\n• potential capacity constraints faced by the limited number of high-voltage foundries and the lack of\ninvestment in new and existing high-voltage foundries;\n• difficulty in attaining consistently high manufacturing yields from high-voltage foundries;\n• delay and time required (approximately one year) to qualify and ramp up production at new high-\nvoltage foundries; and\n• price increases.\nAs a result of these risks, we may be required to use foundries with which we have no established\nrelationships, which could expose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient\ncapacity allocation. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of high-voltage foundry capacity may necessitate\nus making investments in foundries in order to secure capacity, which would require us to substantially\nincrease our capital outlays and possibly raise additional capital, which may not be available to us on\nsatisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of processed tape used in the manufacturing of our products, increased costs of\nmanufacturing such tape, or the loss of one of our suppliers of such tape may increase our costs or limit\nour revenues and impair our ability to ship our products on time.\nThere are a limited number of companies which supply the processed tape used to manufacture our\nsemiconductor products, and we do not have binding long-term supply arrangements with processed tape\nsuppliers that would guarantee us access to processed tape. Therefore, from time to time, shortages of\nsuch processed tape may occur. If any of the processed tape suppliers we rely upon experience difficulties\nin delivering processed tape or are unable to meet the prices, quality or services that we require, or if our\nbusiness relationships with these suppliers weaken or deteriorate, we may not be able to locate alternative\nsources in a timely manner. Therefore, if shortages of processed tape were to occur, or if the costs of\nmanufacturing such tape increases, we would incur additional costs or be unable to ship our products to\nour customers in a timely fashion, all of which could harm our business and our customer relationships and\nnegatively impact our earnings. As a result of these risks, we may also be required to use processed tape\nsuppliers with which we have no established relationships, which could expose us to potentially unfavorable\npricing, unsatisfactory quality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of\nprocessed tape may necessitate us making investments in processed tape suppliers in order to secure adequate\nsupply, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional\ncapital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nThe loss of, or our inability to secure sufficient capacity from, any of our third-party assembly and\ntesting houses at reasonable and competitive prices could disrupt our shipments, harm our customer\nrelationships and reduce our sales.\nAccess to third-party assembly and testing capacity is critical to our business because we do not have\nin-house assembly and testing capabilities for commercial production and instead rely on third-party service\nproviders. Access to these services is especially important to our business because display drivers require\nspecialized assembly and testing services. A limited number of third-party assembly and testing houses\nassemble and test substantially all of our current products. There has been an increased level of industry\nconsolidation among our suppliers in recent years. Therefore, suppliers could be in a better position to\nbargain for higher prices for their services and products, which could result in an increase in our average unit\ncost. See also “—Our suppliers may have increasing bargaining power as a result of industry consolidation,\nwhich could result in an increase in our average unit cost and a decrease in our profit margin.” We do not\nhave binding long-term supply arrangements with assembly and testing service providers that guarantee\nus access to our required capacity. If the primary assembly and testing service providers that we rely upon\n21\nare not able to meet our requirements in price, quality, and service, or if our business relationships with\nthese service providers were adversely affected, we would not be able to obtain the required capacity from\nsuch providers and would have to seek alternative providers, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all. As a result, we do not directly control our product delivery schedules, assembly\nand testing costs, and quality assurance and control. If any of these third-party assembly and testing houses\nexperiences capacity constraints, financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities or if there is any\ndisruption of its assembly and testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing\nservices in a timely manner. Because of the amount of time we usually take to qualify assembly and testing\nhouses, we may experience significant delays in product shipments if we are required to find alternative\nsources. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality or cost of our products could damage\nour reputation and result in a loss of customers and orders.\nAs a result of these risks, we may be required to use assembly and testing service providers with which\nwe have no established relationships, which could expose us to potentially unfavorable pricing, unsatisfactory\nquality or insufficient capacity allocation. Moreover, the scarcity and importance of assembly and testing\nservices may necessitate us making investments in assembly and testing service providers in order to secure\ncapacity, which would require us to substantially increase our capital outlays and possibly raise additional\ncapital, which may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nShortages of key components for our customers’ products could decrease demand for our products.\nShortages of components and other materials that are critical to the design and manufacture of our\ncustomers’ products may limit our sales. These components and other materials include, but are not limited\nto, color filters, backlight modules, polarizers, printed circuit boards and glass substrates. In the past,\ncompanies that use our products in their production have experienced delays in the availability of key\ncomponents from other suppliers. In addition, component manufacturers may not be able to increase or\nmaintain their component supply because of labor shortage in China or otherwise and may shut down certain\nof their capacity from time to time because of weak demand, which may increase the instability of timely\ndelivery and the risk of shortage of components. Such shortages of components and other materials critical to\nthe design and manufacture of our customers’ products may cause a slowdown in demand for our products,\nresulting in a decrease in our sales and adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, as a result\nof uncertain demand conditions, our customers may hesitate to build inventory on hand and tend to release\norders on short notice.\nWe rely on the services of our key personnel, and if we are unable to retain our current key personnel\nand hire additional personnel, our ability to design, develop and successfully market our products could\nbe harmed.\nWe rely upon the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key personnel,\nincluding certain engineering, technical and senior management personnel. In particular, our engineers and\nother key technical personnel are critical to our future technological and product innovations. Competition\nfor highly skilled engineers and other key technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry in\ngeneral and in Taiwan’s flat panel semiconductor industry in particular. Moreover, our future success depends\non the expansion of our senior management team and the retention of key employees such as Jordan Wu, our\npresident and chief executive officer, and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu, our chairman. We rely on these individuals to\nmanage our company, develop and execute our business strategies, and manage our relationships with key\nsuppliers and customers. Any of our key employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice.\nThey could also leave our company to work with a competitor. In addition, we do not have “key person” life\ninsurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any key personnel or our inability to attract\nor retain qualified personnel, whether engineers or others, could delay the development and introduction of\nnew products and would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products as well as on our overall\nbusiness and growth prospects. We may also incur increased operating expenses and be required to divert\nthe attention of other senior executives away from their original duties to recruiting replacements for key\npersonnel.\n22\nIf we fail to forecast customer demand accurately, we may have excess or insufficient inventory, which\nmay increase our operating costs and harm our business.\nThe lead time required by the semiconductor manufacturing service providers that we use to\nmanufacture our products is typically longer than the lead time that our customers provide for delivery of\nour products to them. Therefore, to ensure availability of our products for our customers, we will typically\nask our semiconductor manufacturing service providers to start manufacturing our products based on\nforecasts provided by our customers in advance of receiving their purchase orders. However, these forecasts\nare not binding purchase commitments, and we do not recognize revenues from these products until they\nare delivered to customers. Moreover, for the convenience of our customers, we may agree to ship our\ninventory to warehouses located near our customers, so that our products can be delivered to these customers\nmore quickly. We may from time to time agree that control over a product do not to our customer until the\ncustomer requests delivery of our products from such warehouses. In such cases, we will not recognize\nrevenues from these products until the control over a product to our customers based on the shipping terms,\nwhich is generally when they are delivered to our customers from these warehouses. As a result, we incur\ninventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenues.\nThe anticipated demand for our products may not materialize; therefore, manufacturing based on\ncustomer forecasts exposes us to risks of high inventory carrying costs, increased product obsolescence, and\nerosion of the products’ market value. For example, some of our customers might overstate their forecasts\nbecause of concerns that their semiconductor suppliers cannot deliver on their rush orders. If we overestimate\ndemand for our products or if purchase orders are cancelled or shipments delayed, we may incur excess\ninventory that we cannot sell, or may have to sell at low profit margins or even at a loss, which would harm\nour financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand, we may not have sufficient inventory and\nmay lose market share and damage customer relationships, which also could harm our business. Obtaining\nadditional supply in the face of product shortages may be costly or impossible, particularly in the short term,\nwhich could prevent us from fulfilling orders. These inventory risks are exacerbated by the high level of\ncustomization of our products, which limits our ability to sell excess inventory to other customers, which\ncould eventually lead to write-down of these excess inventory.\nIf we do not achieve additional design wins in the future, our ability to grow will be limited.\nOur future success depends on our current and prospective customers designing our products into\ntheir products. To achieve design wins, we must design and deliver cost-effective, innovative, reliable and\nintegrated products that are customized for our customers’ needs. Once a supplier’s products have been\ndesigned into a system, the panel manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to\nthe significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier. Accordingly, our failure to obtain\nadditional design wins with panel manufacturers and to successfully design, develop and introduce new\nproducts and product enhancements could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA design win is not a binding commitment by a customer to purchase our products and may not result in\nlarge volume orders of our products. Rather, it is a decision by a customer to use our products in the design\nprocess of that customer’s products. Customers can choose at any time to stop using our products in their\ndesigns or product development efforts. Moreover, even if our products were chosen to be incorporated into\na customer’s products, our ability to generate significant revenues from that customer would depend on the\ncommercial success of those products. Thus, a design win may not necessarily generate significant revenues\nif our customers’ products are not commercially successful.\nOur products are complex and may require modifications to resolve undetected errors or failures in\norder for them to function with panels at the desired specifications, which could lead to higher costs,\ncustomer dispute, a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or\nas new versions are released. If our products are delivered with errors or defects, we could incur additional\ndevelopment, repair or replacement costs, and our credibility and the market acceptance of our products\n23\ncould be harmed. Defects could also lead to liability for defective products, customer dispute and lawsuits\nagainst us or our customers. We have agreed to indemnify some of our customers under some circumstances\nagainst liability from defects in our products. A successful product liability claim could require us to make\nsignificant damage payments.\nOur display drivers comprise part of a complex panel manufactured by our customers. Our display\ndrivers must operate according to specifications with the other components used by our customers in the\npanel manufacturing process. For example, during the panel manufacturing process, our display drivers are\nattached to the panel glass and must interoperate with the glass efficiently. If other components fail to operate\nefficiently with our display drivers, we may be required to incur additional development time and costs to\nimprove the interoperability of our display drivers with the other components.\nOur highly integrated products are difficult to manufacture without defects. The existence of defects in\nour products could increase our costs, decrease our sales and damage our customer relationships and\nour reputation.\nThe manufacture of our products is a complex process, and it is often difficult for semiconductor\nfoundries to manufacture our products completely without defects. Minor deviations in the manufacturing\nprocess can cause substantial decreases in yield and quality. In particular, some of our products are highly\nintegrated and incorporate mixed analog and digital signal processing and embedded memory technology,\nand this complexity makes it even more difficult to manufacture without defects.\nThe ability to manufacture products of acceptable quality depends on both product design and\nmanufacturing process technology. Defective products can be caused by design, defective materials or\ncomponent parts, or manufacturing difficulties. Thus, quality problems can be identified only by analyzing\nand testing our display drivers in a system after they have been manufactured. The difficulty in identifying\ndefects is compounded by the uniqueness of the process technology used in each of the semiconductor\nfoundries with which we have subcontracted to manufacture our products. Difficulties in achieving defect-\nfree products due to the increasing complexity of display drivers and the panel system surrounding them may\nresult in an increase in our costs and expenses, and delays in the availability of our products. In addition,\nif the foundries that we use fail to deliver products of satisfactory quality in the volume and at the price\nrequired, we will be unable to meet our customers’ demand for our products or to sell those products at an\nacceptable profit margin, which could adversely affect our sales and margins, and damage our customer\nrelationships and our reputation.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which may result in significant\nuncertainty and volatility with respect to our revenues and could materially and adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers; our sales are made on the basis of\nindividual purchase orders. Our customers may also cancel or defer purchase orders. Our customers’ purchase\norders may vary significantly from period to period, and it is difficult to forecast future order quantities. In\nthe event of a cancellation, postponement, or reduction of an order, we would likely not be able to reduce\noperating expenses sufficiently so as to minimize the impact of the lost revenues. Alternatively, we may have\nexcess inventory that we cannot sell, which would harm our operating results. In addition, changes in our\ncustomers’ business may adversely affect the quantity of purchase orders that we receive. In the past, some of\nour customers have also significantly lowered their capacity utilization rates, reduced or canceled their orders\nof our products, and requested higher-than-usual price concessions from us. We cannot assure you that any of\nour customers will continue to place orders with us in the future at the same level as in prior periods. We also\ncannot assure you that the volume of our customers’ orders will be consistent with our expectations when we\nplan our expenditures. Our results of operations and financial condition may thus be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur corporate actions are substantially controlled by officers, directors and affiliated entities who may\ntake actions that are not in, or may conflict with, our or our public shareholders’ interests.\n24\nAs of February 29, 2020, Jordan Wu and Dr. Biing-Seng Wu (who are brothers) beneficially owned\napproximately 2.1% and 21.7% of our ordinary shares, respectively. For information relating to the beneficial\nownership of our ordinary shares, see “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—\nMajor Shareholders.” These shareholders, acting together, could exert substantial influence over matters\nrequiring approval by our shareholders, including electing directors and approving mergers or other business\ncombination transactions. This concentration of ownership may also discourage, delay or prevent a change\nin control of our company, which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for\ntheir shares as part of a sale of our company and might reduce the price of our ADSs. Actions may be taken\neven if they were opposed by our other shareholders.\nAssertions against us by third parties for infringement of their intellectual property rights could result\nin significant costs and cause our operating results to suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property\nrights and positions, which results in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have\nreceived, and expect to continue to receive, notices of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.\nWe may receive claims from various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets\nor other intellectual property rights in the future. Any lawsuit resulting from such allegations could subject\nus to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their\nsuccess, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and\nattention. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n• stop selling products or using technology or manufacturing processes that contain the allegedly infringing\nintellectual property;\n• pay damages to the party claiming infringement;\n• attempt to obtain a license for the relevant intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all; and\n• attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property with\nnon-infringing intellectual property, which may not be possible.\nThe outcome of a dispute may result in our need to develop non-infringing technology or enter into\nroyalty or licensing agreements. We have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of\ninfringement arising out of the sale of our products. Any intellectual property litigation could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important\nto the success of our business. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and\ncopyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. These afford only limited\nprotection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain,\ncopy or use information that we regard as proprietary, such as product design and manufacturing process\nexpertise. As of February 29, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had 160 U.S. patent applications pending, 112\nTaiwan patent applications pending and 311 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions, including the\nPRC, Japan, Korea and Europe. Our pending patent applications and any future applications may not result\nin issued patents or may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Moreover, policing\nany unauthorized use of our products is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the measures which\nwe have implemented will prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies, particularly in\nforeign jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the United\nStates. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain\naccess to our trade secrets or intellectual property. Our failure to protect our intellectual property effectively\ncould harm our business.\n25\nWe may undertake acquisitions or investments to expand our business that may pose risks to our\nbusiness and dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders, and we may not realize the anticipated\nbenefits of these acquisitions or investments.\nAs part of our growth and product diversification strategy, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to\nacquire or invest in other businesses, intellectual property or technologies that would complement our current\nofferings, expand the breadth of markets we can address or enhance our technical capabilities. For example,\nin February 2018, our subsidiary, Himax IGI Precision Ltd., or Himax IGI, acquired certain advanced nano\n3D masters manufacturing assets and related intellectual property and business from a US-based technology\ncompany. The advanced nano 3D manufacturing masters are primarily used in imprinting or stamping\nreplication process to fabricate devices such as diffractive optical element (DOE), diffuser, collimator\nlens and micro lens array. The acquisition brings Himax the very upstream master tooling capability to\nsupplement the company’s world leading WLO technology, which is critical in its efforts to offer 3D sensing\ntotal solutions. In addition, Himax fully acquired Emza Visual Sense Ltd. (“Emza”) in June 2018. Emza is\nan Israel company dedicated to the development of extremely efficient visual sensors that include proprietary\nmachine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that enable always-on visual sensing capabilities,\nachieving orders of magnitude improvement in power consumption, price and form factor. With the full\nacquisition of Emza, Himax will be uniquely positioned for IoT solutions, which require tight integration\nof the critical skills and knowledge of Himax’s CMOS technology and ASIC design with Emza’s computer\nvision algorithms. Himax will be able to enter new markets beyond consumer electronics, such as connected\nhomes, smart buildings and security, and extend our reach into new IoT markets with interest in other Himax\nproducts such as our 3D sensing solutions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the benefits\nwe anticipate from acquiring nano 3D master business or Emza. Acquisitions or investments that we have\ncompleted or potentially may make in the future entail a number of risks that could materially and adversely\naffect our business, operating and financial results, including:\n• problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products into our existing business and\nproducts;\n• diversion of management’s time and attention from our core business;\n• adverse effects of losses of the acquired target upon our financial condition and results of operations;\n• adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers;\n• the need for financial resources above our planned investment levels;\n• dilution of share ownership of current shareholders under share swap transactions;\n• failures in realizing anticipated synergies;\n• difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired company;\n• risks associated with entering markets in which we lack experience;\n• potential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n• potential write-offs of acquired assets;\n• potential expenses related to the depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets;\nand\n• potential impairment charges related to the goodwill acquired.\nOur failure to address these risks successfully may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\n26\nand results of operations. Any such acquisition or investment may require a significant amount of capital\ninvestment, which would decrease the amount of cash available for working capital or capital expenditures.\nIn addition, if we use our equity securities to pay for acquisitions, the value of our ADSs and the underlying\nordinary shares may be diluted. If we borrow funds to finance acquisitions, such debt instruments may contain\nrestrictive covenants that can, among other things, restrict us from distributing dividends.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could increase our costs and limit the supply of certain\nmetals used in our products.\nAs required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended,\nor the Dodd-Frank Act, in August 2012 the SEC promulgated final rules regarding annual disclosures by\npublic companies of their use of certain minerals and metals, known as “conflict minerals,” which are defined\nas cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold, wolframite or their derivatives and other minerals determined by the\nU.S. government to be financing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These\nnew rules will require us to ascertain and disclose the origin of some of the raw materials that we use. Initial\ndisclosures were required no later than May 31, 2014, with subsequent disclosures required no later than May\n31 of each following year. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements,\nincluding costs for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other\npotential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nThe implementation of these rules and our compliance procedures could adversely affect the sourcing, supply,\nand pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering\n“conflict free” minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary “conflict free” minerals from\nsuch suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches or unexpected system outage or failures could impact\nour business.\nOur computer systems and networks are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires,\npower loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our\ncomputer system and networks. The reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and\nsoftware, and our ability to expand and continually update technologies in response to our changing needs\nand cybersecurity threats, is critical to our business. In recent years, there are increasing and evolving risks\nto cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage,\nemployee malfeasance and human or technological error. Cyber attacks could result in a loss of our\nintellectual property, the release of commercially sensitive information, the misappropriation of confidential\ninformation of our employees, customers or suppliers and the interruption of our business. Failures to protect\nthe privacy of employees, customers or suppliers’ confidential data against breaches of network security\ncould result in the loss of existing or potential customers, other financial loss, and damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation\nmeasures could be significant. While we seek to annually review and assess our cybersecurity policies and\nprocedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, we cannot guarantee that we will not be susceptible\nto new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As of February 29,\n2020, we had not been aware of any material cyber attacks or incidents that had or would expected to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business and operations, nor had we been involved in any legal proceedings or\nregulatory investigations related thereof.\nSome of our data centers are located in areas with a risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are\nalso subject to break-ins and sabotage. Our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities.\nConsequently, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could\nresult in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our service, which could harm our\nrelationship with our customers and suppliers.\nSome of our system services are based on public cloud. The cloud services are also subject to\ninterruption due to cloud service provider unexpected downtimes, cyberattacks or any type of failure,\ntelecommunication failure or other unidentified problems while connecting to cloud. Consequently, cloud\n27\nservices interruption could result in loss of production capabilities and lengthy interruptions in our service.\nCloud cybersecurity breach could result in adverse effect on our customers, our employees, our suppliers, our\nreputation, and our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly, which may negatively impact our\nrevenues and operating results.\nThe price of each semiconductor product typically declines over its product life cycle, reflecting product\nobsolescence, decreased demand as customers shift to more advanced products, decreased unit costs due\nto advanced designs or improved manufacturing yields, and increased competition as more semiconductor\nsuppliers are able to offer similar products. We may experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in\nfuture operating results if our average selling prices decline. We may reduce the average unit price of our\nproducts in response to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors,\nand other factors. The TFT-LCD panel market is highly cost sensitive, which may result in declining average\nselling prices of the components comprising TFT-LCD panels. We expect that these factors will create\ndownward pressure on our average selling prices and operating results. To maintain acceptable operating\nresults, we will need to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis\nand continue to reduce our costs. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by\nincreasing our sales volumes and corresponding production cost reductions, or if we fail to develop and\nintroduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis, our revenues and operating results will suffer.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly\ncompetitive, and we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our competitors.\nThe semiconductor industry, in particular semiconductors used in flat panel displays, is highly\ncompetitive. Increased competition may result in pricing pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market\nshare, any of which could seriously harm our revenues and results of operations. Competition principally\noccurs at the design stage, where a customer evaluates alternative design solutions that require display\ndrivers. We continually face intense competition from fabless display driver companies as well as from\nintegrated device manufacturers. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other\nresources than we do with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of\ntheir products. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changing customer demands or\ndevote greater resources to the development, promotion and sales of their products than we can. Some of\nour competitors have manufacturing capabilities as well as in-house design operations that may give them\nsignificant advantages such as more research and development resources and the ability to attract highly\nskilled engineers. Furthermore, some of our competitors are affiliated with, or are subsidiaries of, our panel\nmanufacturer customers. These relationships may also give our competitors significant advantages such as\nearly access to product roadmaps and design-in priorities, which would allow them to respond more quickly\nto changing customer demands and achieve more design-wins than we can. In addition, even competitors\nwith no such strategic associations with panel manufacturers may resort to price competition to maintain\ntheir market share, which may impose pricing pressures on us, reduce our profitability or decrease our market\nshare. We cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues and market share or\ncompete successfully against our current or future competitors in the semiconductor industry.\nWe may be adversely affected by the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological\nchange, product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide\nfluctuations in product supply and demand. The semiconductor industry has, from time to time, experienced\nsignificant downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both\nsemiconductor companies’ and their customers’ products and declines in general economic conditions. These\ndownturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory\nlevels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Any future downturn may reduce our revenues and\n28\nresult in our having excess inventory. Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in\nincreased competition for access to limited third-party foundry, assembly and testing capacity. Failure to gain\naccess to foundry, assembly and testing capacity could impair our ability to secure the supply of products\nthat we need, which could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, cause a loss of revenues and\ndamage our customer relationships.\nWe have a lengthy and expensive design-to-mass production cycle.\nThe cycle time from the design stage to mass production for display drivers is long and requires the\ninvestment of significant resources with each potential customer without any guarantee of sales. Our design-\nto-mass production cycle typically begins with a three to twelve-month semiconductor development stage\nand test period followed by a three to twelve-month end product development period by customers. This\nfairly lengthy cycle creates the risk that we may incur significant expenses but will be unable to realize\nmeaningful sales. Moreover, prior to mass production, customers may decide to cancel the projects or change\nproduction specifications, resulting in sudden changes in our product specifications, further causing increased\nproduction time and costs. Failure to meet such specifications may delay the launch of our products.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to anticipate changes in evolving\nindustry standards, fail to achieve and maintain technological leadership in our industry or fail to\ndevelop and introduce new and enhanced products.\nOur products are generally based on industry standards, which are continually evolving. The emergence\nof new industry standards could render our products or those of our customers unmarketable or obsolete and\nmay require us to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with any such new standards. Likewise,\nthe components used in the TFT-LCD panel industry are constantly changing with increased demand for\nimproved features. Moreover, our past sales and profitability have resulted, to a significant extent, from our\nability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards, and to develop and introduce new and\nenhanced products in a timely fashion. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly\ndevelop and introduce new and innovative technologies, we may not be able to provide advanced display\nsemiconductors on competitive terms, and some of our customers may buy products from our competitors\ninstead of from us. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes and anticipate future standards will be a\nsignificant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our growth prospects. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to anticipate evolving industry standards, successfully complete the design of\nour new products, have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields, or obtain significant\npurchase orders for these products to meet new standards or technologies. If we fail to anticipate changes\nin technology and to introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Holding Company Structure\nOur ability to receive dividends and other payments or funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by\ncommercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby materially and adversely affect our ability to\ngrow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company and our assets consist mainly of our 100% ownership interest in Himax\nTaiwan. We receive cash from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not\npaid us cash dividends in the past. Nonetheless, dividends and interest on shareholder loans that we receive\nfrom our subsidiaries in Taiwan, if any, will be subject to withholding tax under ROC law. The ability of\nour subsidiaries to provide us with loans, pay dividends, repay any shareholder loans from us or make other\ndistributions to us is restricted by, among other things, the availability of funds, the terms of various credit\narrangements entered into by our subsidiaries, as well as statutory and other legal restrictions. A Taiwan\ncompany is generally not permitted to distribute dividends or to make any other distributions to shareholders\nfor any year in which it did not have either earnings or retained earnings (excluding reserves). In addition,\nbefore distributing a dividend to shareholders following the end of a fiscal year, the Taiwan company must\nrecover any past losses, pay all outstanding taxes and set aside 10% of its annual profits (less prior years’\n29\nlosses and outstanding taxes) as a legal reserve until the accumulated legal reserve equals its paid-in capital,\nand may set aside a special reserve. Any limitation on dividend payments by our subsidiaries could materially\nand adversely affect our ability to grow, finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, pay dividends, and\notherwise fund and conduct our business. In addition, since Himax Taiwan is not a listed company, it will\ndepend on us to meet its equity financing requirements in the future. Any capital contribution by us to Himax\nTaiwan may require the approval of the relevant ROC authorities. We may not be able to obtain any such\napproval in the future in a timely manner, or at all. If Himax Taiwan is unable to receive the equity financing\nit requires, its ability to grow and fund its operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nPolitical, Geographical and Economic Risks\nDue to the location of our operations in Taiwan, we and many of our semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers, suppliers and customers are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events outside\nof our control, which may seriously disrupt our operations.\nMost of our operations, and the operations of many of our semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders, suppliers and customers are located in Taiwan, which is vulnerable to natural disasters, in\nparticular, earthquakes and typhoons. Our principal foundries and assembly and testing houses upon which\nwe have relied to manufacture substantially all of our display drivers are located in Taiwan. In 2019, 19.2%\nof our revenues were derived from customers headquartered in Taiwan. As a result of this geographic\nconcentration, disruption of operations at our facilities or the facilities of our semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers, suppliers and customers for any reason, including work stoppages, power outages,\nwater supply shortages, fire, typhoons, earthquakes, contagious diseases or other natural disasters, could\ncause delays in production and shipments of our products. Any delays or disruptions could result in our\ncustomers seeking to source products from our competitors. Shortages or suspension of power supplies have\noccasionally occurred and have disrupted our operations. The occurrence of a power outage in the future\ncould seriously hurt our business.\nOn February 6, 2016, the 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit the Tainan area. Fortunately, the Company’s\nheadquarters and the in-house manufacturing facilities for LCOS and WLO products, both located in Tainan,\nwere little affected. Since most of our operations and our customers and suppliers are based mainly in\nTaiwan, the natural disasters could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe manufacturing processes of TFT-LCD panels require a substantial amount of water and, as a result,\nthe production operations of TFT-LCD panels may be seriously disrupted by water shortages. Our customers\nmay encounter droughts in areas where most of their current or future manufacturing sites are located. If a\ndrought were to occur and our customers or the authorities were unable to source water from alternative sources\nin sufficient quantities, our customers may be required to shut down temporarily or to substantially reduce the\noperations of their fabs, which would seriously affect demand for our products. The occurrence of any of these\nevents in the future could adversely affect our business.\nDisruptions in Taiwan’s political environment could negatively affect our business and the market price\nof our ADSs.\nOur principal executive offices and a substantial amount of our assets are located in Taiwan, and a\nsubstantial portion of our revenues is derived from our operations in Taiwan. Accordingly, our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations and the market price of our ADSs may be affected by changes in\nROC governmental policies, taxation, inflation or interest rates, and by social instability and diplomatic and\nsocial developments in or affecting Taiwan that are outside of our control.\nTaiwan has a unique international political status. Since 1949, Taiwan and the PRC have been separately\ngoverned. The government of the PRC claims that it is the sole government in China and that Taiwan is\npart of China. Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent\nyears between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has refused to renounce the possibility that it may\nat some point use force to gain control over Taiwan. Furthermore, the PRC government adopted an anti-\n30\nsecession law relating to Taiwan. Relations between the ROC and the PRC governments have been strained\nin recent years for a variety of reasons, including the PRC government’s position on the “One China” policy\nand tensions concerning arms sales to Taiwan by the United States government. Any tension between the\nROC and the PRC, or between the United States and the PRC, could materially and adversely affect the\nmarket prices of our ADSs.\nOur business is sensitive to global economic conditions. A severe or prolonged downturn in the global\nor Taiwan economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nIn recent times, several major systemic political, economic and financial crises negatively affected\nglobal business, banking and financial sectors. Most recently, since 2018, there have been political and trade\ntensions among a number of the world’s major economies. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-\nterm effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and\nfinancial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies. There have also been concerns over unrest in\nthe Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets, and over the possibility\nof a conflict involving Iran. There have also been concerns about the tensions in the relationship between\nChina and Japan and about North Korea’s nuclear program. Economic conditions in Taiwan are sensitive\nto global economic conditions. Any prolonged slowdown in the global or Taiwanese economy may have\na negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and continued turbulence\nin the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity\nneeds.\nA substantial portion of our sales are made to customers in the PRC, which may expose us to additional\npolitical, regulatory, and economic risks.\nWe have been increasingly selling our products to customers in the PRC. In 2018 and 2019,\napproximately 66.4% and 70.3% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in the\nPRC. We expect to continue to increase our sales to customers in the PRC in the near future. As a result of\nthis regional customer concentration, we expect to be particularly subject to economic and political events\nand other developments that affect our customers in the PRC.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including\nthe structure, level of government involvement, level of development, foreign exchange control and\nallocation of resources. The PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-\noriented economy and is growing rapidly. For the past two decades, the PRC government has implemented\neconomic reform measures emphasizing utilization of market forces in the development of the PRC economy\nand also adjusted its macroeconomic control policies from time to time. These policies have led and may\ncontinue to lead to changes in market conditions. Although we believe these reforms have had a positive\neffect on the business of our customers in the PRC and consequently have benefited us, we cannot predict\nwhether changes in the PRC’s political, economic and social conditions, laws, regulations and policies will\nhave any adverse effect on our current or future customers in the PRC. In addition, the interpretation of PRC\nlaws and regulations involves uncertainties. We cannot assure you that changes in such laws and regulations,\nor in their interpretation and enforcement, will not have a material adverse effect on the businesses and\noperations of our customers in the PRC and consequently have a material adverse effect on our own business\nand operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses and affect our results of operations.\nOur functional and reporting currency is U.S. dollars. In 2019, more than 99% of our revenues and\ncost of revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars. However, we have foreign currency exposure and are\nprimarily affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar. This is\nbecause a majority portion of our operating expenses (including for research and development, general\nand administrative, and sales and marketing expenses) are denominated in NT dollars and we maintain\na portion of our cash in NT dollars for local working capital purposes. For example, in December 2019,\napproximately 65% of our operating expenses were denominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage\n31\ndenominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel new shekel and Chinese Renminbi, and the majority\nof the remainder in U.S. dollars. However, the subsidiaries located in the R.O.C. adopted Taiwan-IFRS\nand hereafter changed their functional currency of the tax basis of assets and liabilities from NT dollar to\nU.S. dollar since year 2016. Accordingly, these subsidiaries are now having a U.S. dollar dominated tax\nbasis and functional currency, which significantly decreases the income tax effect from the fluctuations in\nexchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar.\nChanges in ROC tax laws would likely increase our tax expenditures and decrease our net income.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and\ndevelopment expenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30%\nof the income tax payable for the current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute\nfor Industrial Innovation may not be carried forward. Based on the amendments to the above, effective from\nJanuary 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further extended to December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend\nthe tax credits to three years, the tax credit rate will be 10% of the total qualifying research and development\nexpenditure for the current year and subject to a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for each year.\nAccording to the amendments to the “Income Tax Act” enacted by the office of the President of the\nROC on February 7, 2018, an increase in the statutory income tax rate from 17% to 20% and decrease in\nthe undistributed earning tax from 10% to 5% are effective from January 1, 2018. This increase affected\nthe Company’s current tax expense from 2018, and deferred taxes were remeasured in 2018, the period of\nenactment.\nOn July 12, 2016, the ROC Legislative Yuan passed the third reading of anti-avoidance to establish Article\n43-3 Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules and Article 43-4 Place of Effective Management (“PEM”)\nrules of the Income Tax Act (“ITA”). Detailed introduction of the CFC and PEM rules are described as follows:\n(i) A profit-seeking enterprise (“PSE”) that directly or indirectly owns affiliated enterprises in low-tax\njurisdictions outside the territory of the ROC shall recognize and include its pro rata share of affiliated\nenterprises’ annual profits as investment income in its income tax return for the year. Subsequent\nactual dividends and distributions from such affiliated enterprises that were previously recognized as\ninvestment income will then not be subject to income taxation; any surplus to previously recognized\ninvestment income shall be included as taxable income in the allocated year. Low-tax jurisdictions\nare defined as countries where the PSE income tax rate is lower than 70% of the income tax rate of\nthe PSE in the ROC (the statutory income tax rate is 20% from January 1, 2018). (Article 43-3 CFC\nrules); and\n(ii) A PSE is incorporated based on foreign legislation but its place of effective management (PEM) is\nmaintained within the territory of the ROC, and the head office of such PSE will be determined to be\nwithin the territory of the ROC and profit-seeking enterprise income tax shall be levied in accordance\nwith the ITA and relevant tax regulations. The aforementioned PEM refers to a place where\nsubstantive key management and commercial decisions of an entity’s business and its operations are\nmade. (Article 43-4 PEM rule).\nAccording to the legislative intent, the CFC and PEM rules, in principle, will not be put into force\nimmediately, but will wait until the China-Taiwan Cross-Strait Tax Agreement is effectuated, the OECD’s\nCommon Reporting and Due Diligence Standard (“CRS”) for the automatic exchange of information of\nfinancial accounts is widely implemented internationally, and the relevant bylaws of the CFC and PEM rules\nhave been adequately enacted and properly advocated. The date of implementation will be determined by\nthe Executive Yuan. Additionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in the\nCayman Islands. However, if the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and properly\nadvocated, we may be determined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall be levied in\naccordance with the Income Tax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments made by us\nwould be subject to withholding tax in the ROC.\n32\nWe may be affected by the Cayman Economic Substance Law 2018\nWe are incorporated in Cayman Islands. During 2017, the European Union (“EU”) Economic and\nFinancial Affairs Council (“ECOFIN”) released a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The\nstated aim of this list, and accompanying report, was to promote good governance worldwide in order to\nmaximize efforts to prevent tax fraud and tax evasion. Cayman Islands was not on the list of non-cooperative\njurisdictions; however, Cayman Islands did feature in the report as having committed to address concerns\nrelating to economic substance by December 31, 2018.\nIn accordance with that commitment, Cayman Islands enacted the International Tax Co-operation\n(Economic Substance) Law, 2018 (the “ES Law”) in December 2018. Under the ES Law, if a Cayman Islands\ncompany is carrying on as a business one or more “relevant activities” (including: banking, distribution\nand service center, financing and leasing, fund management, headquarters, holding company, insurance,\nintellectual property or shipping), it will be required to maintain a substantial economic presence in Cayman\nIslands and to comply with the economic substance requirements set forth in the ES Law. Companies subject\nto the economic substance requirements will be required to file a declaration with the Cayman Islands Tax\nInformation Authority stating whether or not they are carrying out relevant activities on an annual basis.\nAt present, the impact of the ES Law is unclear and it is impossible to predict the nature and effect of\nthese requirements on us. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the ES Law will have on us.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases, including H1N1 influenza,\nH5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS and Coronavirus.\nIn recent years, there have been reports of outbreaks of a highly pathogenic influenza caused by the H1N1\nvirus, H5N1 virus and H7N9 virus, in certain regions of Asia and other parts of the world. An outbreak of such\ncontagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely\naffect the economies and financial markets of many countries, particularly in Asia. Additionally, a recurrence\nof SARS, a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia, similar to the occurrence in 2003 which affected\nthe PRC, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and certain other countries, would also have similar\nadverse effects. In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, is currently taking place in China\nand all over the world. Since substantially all of our operations, customers and suppliers are based in Asia,\nthe outbreak of H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, SARS, coronavirus or other contagious\ndiseases in Asia or elsewhere, or the perception that such an outbreak could occur, and the measures taken by\nthe governments of countries affected, including the ROC and the PRC, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nThe coronavirus outbreak currently taking place in China and all over the world does represent a major\nuncertainty to our operations, especially for the short term. We are working extremely closely with both our\ncustomers and suppliers in our joint efforts to mitigate the risks. The first quarter guidance provided during\nour fourth quarter earnings call on February 13, 2020 already included the anticipated impact to the business\nfrom the coronavirus outbreak which reflects some downward adjustments mainly from certain China-based\ncustomers for small-sized display drivers and CMOS image sensors. With vast majority of operations located\noutside of China, our suppliers are largely unaffected by the coronavirus outbreak. The focus there is primarily\nthe logistics management including the customs operations in various ports in China.\nThe situation is still evolving. Notwithstanding the uncertainty arisen from the coronavirus, we are\nconfident that we will see decent growth across the board for all our major product categories in 2020.\nRisks Relating to Our ADSs and Our Trading Market\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile.\nThe market price for our ADSs is volatile and has ranged from a low of $1.7 to a high of $4.22 on the\nNASDAQ Global Select Market in 2019.\n33\nThe market price is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including the following:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n• changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n• changes in the expectation of our non-driver product launch timing, forecast and estimates;\n• conditions in the TFT-LCD panel market;\n• changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other display semiconductor companies;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint\nventures or capital commitments;\n• the addition or departure of key personnel;\n• fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar;\n• litigation related to our intellectual property; and\n• the release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ADSs or sales of additional ADSs.\nIn addition, as a result of the worldwide financial crisis, global stock markets have experienced extreme\nprice and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued\nby many companies for reasons which may not be directly related to their operating performance, including but\nnot limited to events such as tax-loss selling, mutual fund redemptions, hedge fund redemptions and margin\ncalls. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our ADSs.\nFuture sales or perceived sales of securities by us, our executive officers, directors or major\nshareholders may hurt the price of our ADSs.\nThe market price of our ADSs could decline as a result of sales of ADSs or shares or the perception that\nthese sales could occur. As of February 29, 2020, we had 344,368,062 outstanding shares and a significant\nnumber of our shares were beneficially owned by certain major shareholders such as our directors and\nexecutive officers. See “Item 7.A. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.”\nIf we, our executive officers, or directors or our shareholders sell ADSs or shares, the market price for our\nshares or ADSs could decline. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, of ADSs or shares by us, our\nexecutive officers, directors or existing shareholders could cause the market price of our ADSs to decline.\nYou may not have the same voting rights as the holders of our ordinary shares and may not receive\nvoting materials sufficiently in advance to be able to exercise your right to vote.\nExcept as described in the deposit agreement, holders of our ADSs will not be able to exercise voting\nrights attaching to the shares evidenced by our ADSs on an individual basis. Holders of our ADSs will\nappoint the depositary or its nominee as their representative to exercise the voting rights attaching to\nthe shares represented by the ADSs. In certain circumstances, however, the depositary shall refrain from\nvoting and any voting instructions received from ADS holders shall lapse. Furthermore, in certain other\ncircumstances, the depositary will give us a discretionary proxy to vote shares evidenced by ADSs. You\nmay not receive voting materials sufficiently in advance to instruct the depositary to vote, and it is possible\nthat you, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the\nopportunity to exercise a right to vote.\nYou may not be able to participate in rights offerings and may experience dilution of your holdings as a result.\n34\nWe may from time to time distribute rights to our shareholders, including rights to acquire our securities.\nUnder the deposit agreement for the ADSs, the depositary will not offer those rights to ADS holders unless\nboth the rights and the underlying securities to be distributed to ADS holders are either registered under the\nSecurities Act, or exempt from registration under the Securities Act with respect to all holders of ADSs. We are\nunder no obligation to file a registration statement with respect to any such rights or underlying securities or to\nendeavor to cause such a registration statement to be declared effective. In addition, we may not be able to take\nadvantage of any exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. Accordingly, holders of our ADSs may\nbe unable to participate in our rights offerings and may experience dilution in their holdings as a result.\nYou may be subject to limitations on transfer of your ADSs.\nYour ADSs represented by the ADRs are transferable on the books of the depositary. However, the\ndepositary may close its transfer books at any time or from time to time whenever it deems expedient in\nconnection with the performance of its duties. In addition, the depositary may refuse to deliver, transfer or\nregister transfers of ADSs generally when our books or the books of the depositary are closed, or at any\ntime if we or the depositary deem it necessary or advisable to do so because of any requirement of law,\nany government, governmental body, commission, or any securities exchange on which our ADSs or our\nordinary shares are listed, or under any provision of the deposit agreement or provisions of, or governing, the\ndeposited securities or any meeting of our shareholders, or for any other reason.\nYour ability to protect your rights through the United States federal courts may be limited, because we\nare incorporated under Cayman Islands law, conduct a substantial portion of our operations in Taiwan,\nand all of our directors and officers reside outside the United States.\nWe are incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A substantial portion of our operations is conducted in\nTaiwan through Himax Taiwan, our wholly owned subsidiary, and substantially all of our assets are located\nin Taiwan. All of our directors and officers reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the\nassets of those persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible\nfor you to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you\nbelieve that your rights have been infringed under the securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful\nin bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of Taiwan may render you unable to\nenforce a United States judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers. There is no\nstatutory recognition in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although a final\nand conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the United States under which a sum of money is\npayable, other than a sum payable in respect of multiple damages, taxes, or other charges of a like nature or\nin respect of a fine or other penalty, may be subject to enforcement proceedings as debt in the courts of the\nCayman Islands under the common law doctrine of obligation, provided that (a) such federal or state courts\nof the United States had proper jurisdiction over the parties subject to such judgment; (b) such federal or\nstate courts of the United States did not contravene the rules of natural justice of the Cayman Islands; (c)\nsuch judgment was not obtained by fraud; (d) the enforcement of the judgment would not be contrary to the\npublic policy of the Cayman Islands; (e) no new admissible evidence relevant to the action is submitted prior\nto the rendering of the judgment by the courts of the Cayman Islands; and (f) there is due compliance with\nthe correct procedures under the laws of the Cayman Islands.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their\ninterests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than shareholders of a\ncorporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests as a shareholder because judicial precedents\nregarding shareholders’ rights are more limited under Cayman Islands law than under U.S. law, and\nbecause Cayman Islands law generally provides less protection to shareholders than U.S. law.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, the Companies\nLaw, Cap. 22 (Law 3 of 1961, as consolidated and revised) of the Cayman Islands, or the Cayman Islands\nCompanies Law, and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action\n35\nagainst directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us\nunder Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The\ncommon law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the\nCayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a\ncourt in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors\nunder Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent\nin some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body\nof securities law than the United States. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully\ndeveloped and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands.\nFor example, the Cayman Islands Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States\ncorporations and their shareholders in certain material respects which may affect shareholders’ rights and\nshareholders’ access to information. These differences under the Cayman Islands Companies Law (as\ncompared to Delaware law) include, though are not limited to, the following:\n• directors who are interested in a transaction do not have a statutory duty to disclose such interest and\nthere are no provisions under the Cayman Islands Companies Law which render such director liable\nto the company for any profit realized pursuant to such transaction. Our articles of association, however,\ncontain provisions that require our directors to disclose their interest in a transaction;\n• dissenting shareholders do not have comparable appraisal rights if a scheme of arrangement is\napproved by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands;\n• shareholders may not be able to bring class action or derivative action suits before a Cayman Islands\ncourt except in certain exceptional circumstances; and\n• unless otherwise provided under the memorandum and articles of association of the company,\nshareholders do not have the right to bring business before a meeting or call a meeting.\nMoreover, certain of these differences in corporate law, including, for example, the fact that shareholders\ndo not have the right to call a meeting or bring business to a meeting, may have anti-takeover effects, which\ncould discourage, delay, or prevent the merger or acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, a\nproxy contest or otherwise, which a shareholder may have considered in its best interest, and prevent the\nremoval of incumbent officers and directors.\nAs a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests\nin the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders\nthan they would have as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\nInvestor confidence and the market price of our ADSs may be adversely impacted if we or our\nindependent registered public accountants conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting\nare not effective.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, as directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct of 2002, adopted rules requiring public companies to include in their Annual Report on Form 10-K or\nForm 20-F, as the case may be, a report of management on the company’s internal controls over financial\nreporting that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls\nover financial reporting. In addition, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm must report\non the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal\ncontrols over financial reporting are not effective. Moreover, even if our management does conclude that our\ninternal controls over financial reporting are effective, if our independent registered public accounting firm\nis not satisfied with our internal controls, the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated\nor reviewed, or if our independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or\nregulations differently from us, then it may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not\neffective. Furthermore, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and attestation, we may identify\n36\ndeficiencies that we may not be able to remedy in a timely manner. If we fail to achieve and maintain the\nadequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls, on\nan ongoing basis, over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Furthermore, effective\ninternal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are\nimportant to help prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls\nover financial reporting could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial\nstatements, which in turn could harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our ADSs. In\naddition, we have incurred considerable costs and used significant management time and other resources in\nour effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.an ongoing basis,\nover financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\n4.A. History and Development of the Company\nHimax Taiwan, our predecessor, was incorporated on June 12, 2001 as a limited liability company\nunder the laws of the ROC. On April 26, 2005, we established Himax Technologies Limited, an exempted\ncompany with limited liability under the Cayman Islands Companies Law, as a holding company to hold the\nshares of Himax Taiwan in connection with our reorganization and share exchange. On October 14, 2005,\nHimax Taiwan became our wholly owned subsidiary through a share exchange consummated pursuant to the\nROC Business Mergers and Acquisitions Law through which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding\nshares of Himax Taiwan, and we issued ordinary shares to the shareholders of Himax Taiwan. Shareholders\nof Himax Taiwan received one of our ordinary shares in exchange for one Himax Taiwan common share.\nThe share exchange was unanimously approved by shareholders of Himax Taiwan on June 10, 2005 with\nno dissenting shareholders and by the ROC Investment Commission on August 30, 2005 for our inbound\ninvestment in Taiwan, and on September 7, 2005 for our outbound investment outside of Taiwan. We effected\nthis reorganization and share exchange to comply with ROC laws, which prohibit a Taiwan incorporated\ncompany not otherwise publicly listed in Taiwan from listing its shares on an overseas stock exchange. Our\nreorganization enables us to maintain our operations through our Taiwan subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, while\nallowing us to list our shares overseas through our holding company structure.\nOn September 26, 2005, we changed our name to “Himax Technologies, Inc.,” and on October 17, 2005,\nHimax Taiwan changed its name to “Himax Technologies Limited” upon the approval of shareholders of\nboth companies and amendments to the respective constitutive documents.

Business Overview\nWe are a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies.\nWe are a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors,\nmobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer\nelectronics devices. Additionally, we design and provide controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch\nand Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, and\nLCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and head-up displays (HUD) for automotive. We\nalso offer digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for AR devices, 3D\nsensing and machine vision, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet,\nlaptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of Things. For\ndisplay drivers and display-related products, our customers are panel manufacturers, agents or distributors,\nmodule manufacturers and assembly houses. We also work with camera module manufacturers, optical\nengine manufacturers, and television system manufacturers for various non-driver products. We believe that\nour recognized leading design and engineering expertise, combined with our focus on customer service and\nclose relationships with semiconductor manufacturing service providers, has contributed to our success.\nIndustry Background\nWe mainly operate in the flat panel display semiconductor industry. As the majority of our revenues\nderive from products that are critical components of flat panel displays, such as display drivers, timing\ncontrollers, power ICs and other semiconductor products, our industry is closely linked to the trends and\ndevelopments of the flat panel display industry.\nFlat Panel Display Semiconductors\nFlat panel displays require different semiconductors depending upon the display technologies and the\napplications. Some of the most important ones include the following:\n• Display Driver. The display driver receives image data from the timing controller and delivers\nprecise analog voltages or currents to create images on the display. The major application of display\ndriver IC is used on TFT-LCDs. However, AMOLED display is also getting more and more popular\nin recently years, starting from high-end smartphone and TV applications. Detailed display driver IC\nspecification for LCD and AMOLED are different due to panel characteristics. The two main types\nof display drivers for a display panel are gate drivers and source drivers. Gate drivers turn on the\ntransistor within each pixel cell on the horizontal line on the panel for data input at each row. Source\n38\ndrivers receive image data from the timing controller and generate voltage that is applied to the\nliquid crystal within each pixel cell on the vertical line on the panel for data input at each column.\nThe combination determines the colors generated by each pixel. Typically, multiple gate drivers and\nsource drivers are installed separately on the panel. However, for certain small and medium-sized\napplications, gate drivers and source drivers are integrated into a single chip due to space and cost\nconsiderations. Large-sized panels typically have higher resolution and require more display drivers\nthan small and medium-sized panels.\n• Timing Controller. The timing controller receives image data and converts the format for the source\ndrivers’ input. The timing controller also generates controlling signals for gate and source drivers.\nTypically, the timing controller is a discrete semiconductor in large-sized TFT-LCD panels. For\ncertain small and medium-sized applications, however, the timing controller may be integrated with\ndisplay drivers.\n• Operational Amplifier. An operational amplifier supplies the reference voltage to source drivers in\norder to make their output voltage uniform.\n• Power IC. Power ICs include certain drivers, amplifiers, DC to DC converters and other\nsemiconductors designed to enhance power management, such as voltage regulation, voltage boosting\nand battery management.\n• Touch controller IC. For touch screen applications, touch controller ICs enable touch interfaces, such\nas capacitive touch panels, to identify, qualify and track user’s contacts with precision and sensibility.\n• Others. Flat panel displays also require multiple general purpose semiconductors such as memory,\npower converters and inverters.\nCharacteristics of the Display Driver Market\nAlthough we operate in several distinct segments of the flat panel display semiconductor industry, our\nprincipal products are display drivers. Display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays. The\ndisplay driver market has specific characteristics, including those discussed below.\nConcentration of Panel Manufacturers\nThe global TFT-LCD panel industry consists of a small number of manufacturers, substantially\nall of which are based in Asia. In recent years, TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, especially China-\nbased manufacturers, have invested or are planning to invest heavily to establish, construct and ramp\nup additional fab capacity. The capital intensive nature of the industry often results in TFT-LCD panel\nmanufacturers operating at a high level of capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs. This tends to\ncreate a temporary oversupply of panels, which reduces the average selling price of panels and puts pricing\npressure on component companies including display driver companies. Moreover, the concentration of panel\nmanufacturers permits major panel manufacturers to exert pricing pressure on display driver companies such\nas us. The small number of panel manufacturers exacerbates this situation as display driver companies, in\naddition to seeking to expand their customer base, must also focus on winning a larger percentage of such\ncustomers’ display driver requirements.\nCustomization Requirements\nEach panel display has a unique pixel design to meet its particular requirements. To optimize the panel’s\nperformance, display drivers have to be customized for each panel design. The most common customization\nrequirement is for the display driver company to optimize the gamma curve of each display driver for each\npanel design. Display driver companies must work closely with their customers to develop semiconductors\nthat meet their customers’ specific needs in order to optimize the performance of their products.\n39\nMixed-Signal Design and High-Voltage CMOS Process Technology\nDisplay drivers have specific design and manufacturing requirements that are not standard in the\nsemiconductor industry. Some display drivers require mixed-signal design since they combine both\nanalog and digital devices on a single semiconductor to process both analog signals and digital data.\nManufacturing display drivers require high-voltage CMOS process technology operating typically at 4.5\nto 24 volts for source drivers and 10 to 50 volts for gate drivers, levels of voltage which are not standard in\nthe semiconductor industry. For display drivers, the driving voltage must be maintained under a very high\ndegree of uniformity, which can be difficult to achieve using standard CMOS process technology. However,\nmanufacturing display drivers does not require very small-geometry semiconductor processes. Typically,\nthe manufacturing process for large panel display drivers require geometries between 0.11 micron and 1\nmicron because the physical dimensions of a high-voltage device do not allow for the economical reduction\nin geometries below this range. We believe that there are a limited number of fabs with high-voltage CMOS\nprocess technology that are capable of high-volume manufacturing of display drivers.\nSpecial Assembly and Testing Requirements\nManufacturing display drivers requires certain assembly and testing technologies and equipment that\nare not standard for other semiconductors and are offered by a limited number of providers. The assembly\nof display drivers typically uses either tape-automated bonding, also known as TAB, or chip-on-glass, also\nknown as COG, technologies. Display drivers also require gold bumping, which is a process in which gold\nbumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die and the processed tape, in the case of TAB packages, and\nthe glass, in the case of COG packages. TAB may utilize tape carrier packages, also known as TCP, or chip\non film, also known as COF. The type of assembly used depends on the panel manufacturer’s design, which\nis influenced by panel size and application and is typically determined by the panel manufacturers. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and, to a lesser extent, COG package\ntypes, whereas display drivers for mobile handsets and consumer electronics products typically require COG\npackages. The testing of display drivers also requires special testers that can support high-channel and high-\nvoltage output semiconductors. Such testers are not standard in the semiconductor industry.\nSupply Chain Management\nThe manufacturing of display drivers is a complex process and requires several manufacturing stages\nsuch as wafer fabrication, gold bumping, and assembly and testing, and the availability of materials such as\nthe processed tape used in TAB packaging. We refer to these manufacturing stages and material requirements\ncollectively as the “supply chain.” Panel manufacturers typically operate at high levels of capacity utilization\nand require a reliable supply of display drivers. A shortage of display drivers, or a disruption to this supply,\nmay disrupt panel manufacturers’ operations since replacement supplies may not be available on a timely\nbasis or at all, given the customization of display drivers. As a result, a display driver company’s ability to\ndeliver its products on a timely basis at the quality and quantity required is critical to satisfying its existing\ncustomers and winning new ones. Such supply chain management is particularly crucial to fabless display\ndriver companies that do not have their own in-house manufacturing capacity. In the case of display drivers,\nsupply chain management is further complicated by the high-voltage CMOS process technology and the\nspecial assembly and testing requirements that are not standard in the semiconductor industry. Access to this\ncapacity also depends in part on display driver companies having received assurances of demand for their\nproducts since semiconductor manufacturing service providers require credible demand forecasts before\nallocating capacity among customers and investing to expand their capacity to support growth.\nNeed for Higher Level of Integration\nThe small form factor of mobile handsets and certain consumer electronics products restricts the space\nfor components. Small and medium-sized panel applications typically require one or more source drivers,\none or more gate drivers and one timing controller, which can be installed as separate semiconductors or as\nan integrated single-chip driver. Customers are increasingly demanding higher levels of integration in order\nto manufacture more compact panels, simplify the module assembly process and reduce unit costs. Display\n40\ndriver companies must be able to offer highly integrated chips that combine the source driver, gate driver\nand timing controller, as well as semiconductors such as memory, power circuit and image processors, into a\nsingle chip. Due to the size restrictions and stringent power consumption constraints of such display drivers,\nsingle-chip drivers are complex to design. For large-sized panel applications, integration is both more\ndifficult to achieve and less important since size and weight are less of a priority. Lastly, as our TFT-LCD\npanel customers had turned to pure in-cell TDDI panel development for thinner display designs, we have\ndeveloped a series of single chip touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch\ndisplay panel.\nProducts and Solutions\nWe have several principal product lines:\n• display drivers and timing controllers;\n• touch controller ICs;\n• ASIC service;\n• LCOS and MEMS products;\n• power ICs;\n• CMOS image sensor products;\n• wafer level optics products;\n• 3D sensing business; and\n• Ultra-low power smart sensing.\nDisplay Drivers and Timing Controllers\nDisplay Driver Characteristics\nDisplay drivers deliver precise analog voltages and currents that activate the pixels on panels. The\nfollowing is a summary of certain display driver characteristics and their relationship to panel performance.\n• Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution refers to the number of pixels per line multiplied by\nthe number of lines, which determines the level of fine detail within an image displayed on a panel.\nFor example, a color display screen with 1,024 x 768 pixels has 1,024 red columns, 1,024 green\ncolumns and 1,024 blue columns for a total of 3,072 columns and 768 rows. The red, green and blue\ncolumns are commonly referred to as “RGB.” Therefore, the display drivers need to drive 3,072\ncolumn outputs and 768 row outputs. The number of display drivers required for each panel depends\non the resolution of the panel and the number of channels per display driver. For example, an XGA\n(1,024 x 768 pixels) panel requires eight 384-channel source drivers (1,024 x 3 = 384 x 8) and three\n256-channel gate drivers (768 = 256 x 3), while a full HD (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) panel requires\neight 720-channel source drivers and four 270-channel gate drivers. The number of display drivers\nrequired can be reduced by using drivers with a higher number of channels. For example, a full HD\npanel can have six 960-channel source drivers instead of eight 720-channel source drivers. Thus,\nusing display drivers with a higher number of channels can reduce the number of display drivers\nrequired for each panel, although display drivers with a higher number of channels typically have\nhigher unit costs.\n• Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a screen, which is\n41\ndetermined by the number of shades of a color, also known as gray scale, that can be shown by the\npanel. For example, a 6-bit source driver is capable of generating 26 x 26 x 26 = 218, or 262K colors,\nand similarly, an 8-bit source driver is capable of generating 16 million colors. Typically, for TFT-\nLCD panels currently in commercial production, 262K, 16 million and 1 billion colors are supported\nby 6-bit, 8-bit and 10-bit source drivers, respectively.\n• Operational Voltage. A display driver operates with two voltages: the input voltage (which enables\nit to receive signals from the timing controller) and the output voltage (which, in the case of source\ndrivers, is applied to liquid crystals and, in the case of gate drivers, is used to switch on the TFT\ndevice). Source drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts and output voltages\nranging from 7 up to 18 volts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 3.3 to 1.8 volts\nand output voltages ranging from 10 to 50 volts. Lower input voltage saves power and lowers\nelectromagnetic interference, or EMI. Output voltage may be higher or lower depending on the\ncharacteristics of the liquid crystal (or diode), in the case of source drivers, or TFT device, in the\ncase of gate drivers.\n• Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied\nto it by the source driver is nonlinear and is referred to as the “gamma curve” of the source driver.\nDifferent panel design and manufacturing processes require source drivers with different gamma\ncurves. Display drivers need to adjust the gamma curve to fit the pixel design. Due to the materials\nand processes used in manufacturing, panels may contain certain imperfections which can be\ncorrected by the gamma curve of the source driver, a process which is generally known as “gamma\ncorrection.” For certain types of liquid crystal, the gamma curves for RGB cells are significantly\ndifferent and thus need to be independently corrected. Some advanced display drivers feature three\nindependent gamma curves for RGB cells.\n• Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and display\ndrivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the\nlarger data volume necessary for video images. Panels used for higher data transmission applications,\nsuch as televisions, require more advanced interface technology. The principal types of interface\ntechnologies are transistor-to-transistor logic, or TTL, reduced swing differential signaling, or RSDS,\nmini-low voltage differential signaling, or mini-LVDS, and point-to-point high-speed interface.\nAmong these, RSDS, mini-LVDS and point-to-point interface were developed as low power, low\nnoise and low amplitude methods for high-speed data transmission using fewer copper wires and\nresulting in lower EMI. Moreover, there are some panel manufacturers developing their proprietary\npoint-to-point interfaces, such as embedded panel interface, or EPI, USI-T, iSP, CEDS, CHPI ,CSPI\nand CMPI.\n• Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses TAB and COG package types. COF\nand TCP are two types of TAB packages, of which COF packages have become predominantly used\nin recent years. Customers typically determine the package type required according to their specific\nmechanical and electrical considerations. In general, display drivers for small-sized panels mainly\nuse COG package types, whereas display drivers for large-sized panels primarily use TAB package\ntypes and, to a lesser extent, COG package types.\nLarge-Sized Applications\nWe provide source drivers, gate drivers, PMIC, P-gamma OP level shifter and timing controllers\n(TCON) for large-sized panels principally used in desktop monitors, notebook computers and televisions.\nDisplay drivers used in large-sized applications feature different key characteristics, depending on the end-\nuse application. For example, the industry trend for large-sized applications is generally toward super\nhigh channel, low power consumption, low cost, thin and light form factor, touch function, higher data\ntransmission rate and higher driving capabilities. Higher speed interface technologies are also key for 4Kx2K\nand 8Kx4K high-resolution TVs. Greater color depth, thermal solution, high data rate and high driving, are\nparticularly important for advanced televisions and certain monitors.\n42\nOur large display driver IC business achieved several milestones in 2019. For example, we successfully\nadded a 12-inch fab into the pool of our foundry capacity for our large display driver ICs to ease the\ncapacity shortage of 8” foundry where the vast majority of large panel driver ICs are fabricated. On high-\nend TV, Himax outpaced peers to lead the mass production of customized high-speed point-to-point (P2P)\ntransmission using embedded panel intra interface such as iSP, CHPI, USI-T and CSPI for 4K TVs and\ndeveloped a 2-in-1 COF driver to meet the requirements of high channel count and heat dissipation for\n8K TV. On gaming monitor, we have high frame rate and high driving driver to meet the needs of various\nresolutions and frame rates such as UHD 165Hz, QHD 240Hz, FHD 320Hz, etc. We also successfully\ndeveloped low power consumption driver applied in low power monitor to satisfied Energy star 8.0. Lastly,\nour P2P driver and TCON ICs with 13.3\" FHD can meet Intel 1W project requirement.\nWe also made tremendous progress in TCON product lines in 2019. Jointly with our Tier 1 customers,\nwe developed 8K TV TCON for their 8K 60 Hz and 120Hz TV from 55” to 110”, leveraging Himax's\nunique two phase demura and SHR technologies, which can greatly improve mura to improve yield rate of\n8K TV panel and solve the problem of insufficient 8K content. We also provide gaming TCON for the new\nUHD 144Hz gaming monitor and notebook. As for eDP (Embedded DisplayPort) notebook TCONs, Himax\ncontinues to develop more power-efficient drivers including mLVDS and P2P interfaces. Our mLVDS is able\nto integrate P-gamma OP to reduce PCB size and make notebooks slimmer, allowing more space for touch\nsolution integration. Last but not the least, we successfully embedded local dimming in TCON ICs for TFT-\nLCD automotive applications to support the accelerating trend toward large-scale screen, higher contrast\ninstrument panels needed for drivers to read meter content quickly. This industry-leading next generation\nautomotive display technology has been greatly appreciated by auto OEMs, Tier 1 and panel makers and is\nexpected to begin mass production in an electronic vehicle during 2020.\nThe table below sets forth the features of our products for large-sized applications:\nProduct Features\nTFT-LCD Source Drivers • 384 to 1920 output channels\n• 6-bit (262K colors), 8-bit (16 million colors) or 10-bit (1 billion colors)\n• one gamma-type driver\n• two gamma-type driver to improve display quality\n• three gamma-type drivers (RGB independent gamma curve to enhance\ncolor image)\n• output driving voltage ranging from 7 up to 20V\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V and\nsupport half VDDA\n• low power consumption and low EMI\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS (up to 400MHz), cascade modulated\ndriver interface, or CMDI, point-to-point high speed interface (up to\n4Gbps for 8K 120Hz) and customized interface technologies\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\nTFT-LCD Gate Drivers • 192 to 1600 output channels\n• output driving voltage ranging from 10 up to 50v\n• input logic voltage ranging from standard 3.3V to low power 1.8V\n• low power consumption\n• support COF and COG package types\n• support dual gate and triple gate panel designs\n43\nProduct Features\nTiming Controllers • product portfolio supports a wide range of resolutions, from VGA (640\nx 480 pixels) to full HD, UHD and 8K4K (1,920 x 1,080 pixels, 1,920\nx 1,200 pixels, 3840 x 2160 and 7680 x 4320)\n• support TTL, RSDS, mini-LVDS, DETTL, turbo RSDS, CMDI,\npoint-to-point high speed interface and customized output interface\ntechnologies\n• embedded overdrive function to improve response time\n• support CABC to save power and color engine to enhance color and\nsharpness\n• support TTL, LVDS, eDP, G-sync, MIPI and V-by-one input interface\ntechnologies\n• support dual-gate, triple-gate, GOA (gate on array) and RGBW panel\ndesigns\n• support amorphous silicon, IGZO and LTPS panel\n• ASIC AMOLED timing controller\nProgrammable Gamma OP • 8 to 16 channel gamma buffer outputs\n• channel VCOM buffer output\n• Internal non-volatile memory\n• 2 gamma bank selection, setting time < 3uS\n• Analog power supply voltage: 9.0V to 20.0V\n• Digital power supply voltage: 2.7V to 3.6V\n• Peak current on gamma channels: 200mA\n• Peak current on VCOM channel: 400mA\n• Programmable VCOM limit\n• 12C speed up to 1MHz\nElectronic Paper Display Applications\nWe offer display driver for the Electronic Paper Display (EPD) applications, such as reading & writing\ndevice, Electronic Shelf Label (ESL) and Signage Display.

This has also contributed to higher demand for mobile handset displays that have a\nlarger size and higher resolution. In the past few years, we offered innovative handset display driver products\nby providing FWVGA (480 x 864), qHD (540 x 960), WSVGA (1024 x 600), HD720 (720 x 1280) / WXGA\n(800 x 1280), FHD (1080 x 1920) / WUXGA (1200 x 1920) and up to QHD (1440 x 2560) / WQXGA\n(1600x2560) display driver ICs. We have recently continued to update new products for this mainstream\nsmartphone and tablet PC segment with lower cost and new features, such as color enhancement and sun-\nlight readability enhancement functions. In 2015, we developed new technologies and led the display\nindustry with next generation display driver ICs, such as a-si FHD (1080 x 1920), AMOLED ASICs for HD\nand FHD and LTPS QHD (1440 x 2560) with sub-pixel rendering technologies. In 2016, Himax developed a\nseries of single chip touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-cell touch display panel.\nHimax started the shipments of in-cell TDDI for some smartphones in 2016 and extended TDDI solution to\ntablet PCs application in 2017. Smartphone display had a dramatic change in terms of aspect ratio, instead\nof resolution, in 2017. Though display resolution of entry smartphones kept moving up from WVGA or qHD\nto HD, high-end smartphone display may be stuck at FHD or QHD since it’s pixel per inch is good enough\nfor normal consumers’ daily use. OEMs start to seek for differentiation with 18:9 or even wider aspect ratio,\nfull front displays. Himax has designed conventional 16:9 HD and FHD DDICs capable of supporting 18:9\nor wider HD+/FHD+ displays and achieved a number of design-wins with leading Chinese smartphone\nbrands. As in-cell TDDI, featuring thinner display, slimmer border, and better visual quality, has been getting\npopular, we re-invented a new generation of TDDIs supporting COG and COF for 18:9 or wider aspect ratio\nwith interlaced output pins, which makes the bottom border of the in-cell touch display even smaller to gain\nhigher display to body ratio. Our new generation FHD+ TDDI with COG and COF are in design-in stage\nwith a few leading Chinese smartphone brands and panel makers. While COG TDDI offers cost effective slim\nbezel design, TDDI with COF package can enable super-slim bezel design for premium smartphone models.\nWe started small volume shipment in the first half of 2018 with accelerating volume started in the second half\nof 2018 into 2019 and beyond.\nA major development we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the OLED display for\nsmartphone. This is due to investments on expanded AMOLED capacity as well as increased demand for\nunder-display fingerprint technology that is only available in the AMOLED display for the time being. We\nare collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China for AMOLED product development. We\nbelieve AMOLED driver ICs will soon become one of the major growth engines for our small panel driver\nIC business.\nOn the other hand, the application of in-cell TDDI start to extend from mainstream smartphone to\nlarger displays in 2018 as Himax start to offer various new TDDI solutions for tablet PCs, smart speakers,\nand even some infotainment displays in automobiles. The first tablet TDDI with WXGA resolution went\nmass production in 2018 and also extended to leading smart speaker applications as well. In 2019, Himax\nannounced a series of new driver and TDDIs for tablet application. A COF packaged driver IC solution\nenables a leading tablet PC OEM successfully launching a WQXGA resolution tablet with super slim bezel.\nAnother new TDDI, supporting up to WUXGA and WQXGA resolution, design-win multiple projects\nfrom tablet PC OEMs across Korea and China in 2019. We also launched the first TDDI supporting active\nstylus function in tablets which this will commence mass production and contribute to our tablet application\nbusiness in 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the features of our products for mobile handsets and tablet application:\n45\nProduct Features\nMobile Handset Display Drivers • highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver,\ngate driver, power circuit, timing controller and memory\n• suitable for a wide range of resolutions from QQVGA (128 x 160\npixels) to QHD (1440 x 2560 pixels)\n• support up to 16 million colors\n• support RGB separated gamma adjustment\n• support CABC\n• support color enhancement features including saturation,\nbrightness, and sharpness enhancement\n• support MIPI interface for smartphone application and LVDS for\nCE applications\n• support RAM-less or 1/3 RAM compression technologies\n• low power consumption and low EMI\n• fewer external components to reduce costs\n• slimmer die for compact module to fit smaller mobile handset\ndesigns\n• application specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, can be designed\nto meet customized requirements for LCD or AMOLED\n• touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-\ncell touch display\n• extending from 16:9 to 18:9 or wider aspect ratio\n• COG and COF solutions for super slim bottom border\n• AMOLED driver IC with sub-pixel rendering, Demura-IPs for\nFHD+\nTablet PC Display Drivers • highly integrated single chip embedded with the source driver,\npower circuit, and timing controller\n• suitable for a wide range of resolutions from WSVGA (600 x\n1024), WXGA (800 x 1280), WUXGA (1200x1920) to WQXGA\n(1600 x 2560)\n• support up to 16 million colors\n• support RGB separated gamma adjustment\n• support CABC\n• support color enhancement features\n• support MIPI interface\n• touch display driver integrated circuit (TDDI) for advanced in-\ncell touch display\n• supporting TDDI with active stylus\n• COG and COF solutions for super slim bezel\nAutomotive Display Applications\nWe offer source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers and integrated drivers for the fast ramping\nautomotive display applications, such as instrument cluster display (ICD), center information display (CID),\nhead-up display (HUD), rear seat entertainment display (RSE) and rearview mirror display.\nThe automotive display drivers can support various display resolutions to meet the customized needs\nof automotive display, including GIP panel and non-GIP panel, a-TFT panel and LTPS panel.

The main\nproducts are Power Managements ICs (PMIC), Programmable Gamma OP ICs (PGOP) and Level Shifter\nICs (LS). In recent years, PMIC/PGOP/LS 3-in-1 PMIC has gradually become the mainstream solution.\nPower Management ICs\n49\nA power management IC integrates several power components to fulfill system power requirements. It\nmay include step-up or step-down pulse width modulation, or PWM, DC-to-DC converters, low-dropout\nregulators, or LDO regulators, voltage detectors, operational amplifiers, p-gamma OP, level shifters, or\nother components. For panel module applications, a power management IC provides a reliable and precise\nvoltage for source drivers, gate drivers, timing controllers, and panel cells. Moreover, its built-in over-\ntemperature and over-current protections help prevent components from being damaged under certain\nabnormal conditions. As integrating an increasing number of components into a power management IC is\nlikely to be a continuing trend, we believe power management ICs will continue to be critical components\nof a TFT-LCD panel module.

The level shifter converts the timing-\ncontroller (TCON) logic-level signals to the high-level signals needed by the GOA (gate on array) display.\nThe output circuitry has been designed to achieve high rise and fall times when driving the capacitive\nloads typically encountered in TFT-LCD display applications.\nProduct Features\n16- channel level shifter for dual gate • support two kinds of T-con input signals\nGOA TFT-LCD • 6/8/10 clock channel output\n• 2 channel STV\n• 2 channel LC\n• 2 discharge channels\n• support charge sharing function\n• reset function\n• OTP/OCP (detect level, time and count) with I2C adjustment\n• Support 2 input and 6/8/10 output\nLED driver\nA light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that is widely used in lighting, display\nand TFT LCD backlight nowadays. The advantages of LEDs as light sources are the small size, fast\nswitching, low power consumption and long lifetime etc.\nLED driver IC is designed to dim the LEDs with critical features like, high current accuracy, high\ncurrent matching, short LED protection, open LED protection, over voltage protection, ghosting effect\nreduction and current sink leakage protection etc.\nProduct Features\nCustomer ASIC • By Customer Specification\nCMOS Image Sensor Products\nThe CMOS image sensor products are developed by our subsidiary, Himax Imaging. The products\nwere designed firstly for camera-equipped mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets and notebook\ncomputers, with a focus on low light image and video quality. Based on the technologies and IP we\ndeveloped, our product lines have been expanded to cover three domains: ultra-low power computer\nvision- Always-On Sensor (“AoS”), Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, and big pixel BSI sensors in automotive\nand surveillance. In 2019, we further prioritized our focus on ultra-low power computer vision- Always-\nOn Sensor (“AoS”) as the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly\ngrowing. Together with the technologies we already developed, such as Near Infrared (“NIR”) sensor, we\ncan provide our customers the best integrated solutions for several specific domains.\n51\nIn addition to advancing our AoS sensor to drive the power as low as possible, we also devote\nourselves to developing sensors that have industry leading small pixel (1.12um) with higher near infrared\nQuantum Efficiency (“QE”) to support the new generation cameras. Their superior performance hugely\nhelps to reduce the system’s power consumption and therefore enhances the system performance. With\nthe high QE in NIR band, we open the doors to building more sensor and camera systems for machine\nvision. For example, our latest laptop product, HM110B1, is a critical part of Himax’s WiseEye solution,\nan AI-based ultra-low power smart sensing total solution. Given its cool and slim (narrower than 2mm)\ndimension to support ultra-thin bezel, we combine original RGB video conference sensor, IR sensor\noriginally for Windows Hello support, and newly added intelligent AoS sensor into a single silicon. This\n3-in-1 sensor not only enables new features, but also hugely saves laptop makers’ effort in mechanical\ndesign and overall cost.\nWe are committed to be a key player in the CMOS image sensor business with investments in\nexperienced human resources, an efficient supply chain, and strategic technology developments and\npartnerships to further increase the performance and features of small and specially designed pixel sensors.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our CMOS image sensor products:\nProduct Features\n5MP UltraSense 2TM NIR Sensor • 1/2.6” format color type with

This\ninnovative approach enables wafer level optics to manufacture micro/nano optics structure and high\ntemperature resistance, making the compatible Surface-Mount Technology or SMT reflow process possible.\nWe offer entire optical solutions for customers who need compact and easy-to-handle optical products on\ntheir electronic devices.\nCombining traditional optical lens design, precise mold control and semiconductor manufacturing\nexpertise, our WLO lens with integrated waveguide, refractive optics and diffractive optical element (DOE)\nis the best solution for next generation computational imaging module for 2D/3D illumination and 3D dot\nprojector, which can be applied to 3D face recognition, 3D sensing, 3D reconstruction, and gesture control.\nWith the innovative process and specific structure, our wafer level optics products provide small form factor\nand compact module size to be easily integrated into consumer products such as smartphones, AR/VR\ndevices, and other mobile devices.\nOur WLO technology is also adapted to form microstructure such as lens array, DOE and lenticular lens\nfor advanced applications in digital and computational imaging fields. These technologies stand in a unique\nposition to integral optical design, semiconductor manufacturing process, and compact packaging service,\nwhich are rarely covered by one single company. Deeply rooted in core wafer level optics technologies, we\nprovide highly customized optical solutions and high-volume manufacturing to many tier 1 customers in the\nAR/VR, mobile device and wearable front.\nOur WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017 when we began mass shipment to an anchor\ncustomer. The overall 2018 shipment increased considerably year-over-year because of the customer’s large-\nscale adoption in more models. In 2019, we continued the strong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill\n54\non anchor customer’s higher demand with a significant year-over-year increase. Himax’s WLO business in\nterms of shipment volume has been largely dependent on one anchor customer for the past 30 months. We\ncontinue to make progress with our ongoing R&D projects for next generation products centered around our\nexceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO technology.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our wafer level optics products:\nProduct Features\nRefractive Optical Lens • for Micro Lens Array (MLA) illumination diffuser, lighting\ncontrol, flux illumination lens, collimation lens, and compact\nsize camera lens\n• provide multi-layer solution including optical AR coating, IR-\ncutting filter coating, aspheric surface\n• double-side manufacture process\n• already in mass production\nDiffractive Optical Element (DOE) • computational imaging, flux illumination, dot projector for 3D\nsensing, 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE and refractive\nlens\n• provide customized solution for specific application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nDiffuser element for flood • using WLO process to integral multi-layers DOE technology\nillumination and TOF • the smallest form factor and reflowable component\n• eye safety detect circuit embedded\nNear Infrared (NIR) Projector • dot projector module solution for computer vision, 3D sensing,\nModule 3D reconstruction, gesture and illumination control\n• integral NIR Laser (830/850/940nm), optical system\n(refractive+ diffractive lens) and high precise active alignment\nassembly solution to provide the smallest form factor\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• provide customized module solution for different application\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\nFlood illumination Module • provide customized solution for specific application integral\nNIR Laser (830/850/940nm), and high precise active alignment\nassembly solution\n• module design for smartphone and other mobile devices\n• the smallest form factor and reflowable device\n• including active eye safety solution (Class-1)\n3D Sensing Business\nWe continue to participate in most of the smartphone OEMs’ ongoing 3D sensing projects covering\nstructured light and time-of-flight (ToF). However, in 2018, our structured light-based 3D sensing total\nsolution targeting Android smartphone’s front-facing application was unsuccessful due to the high hardware\ncost of 3D sensing, the long development lead time required to integrate it into the smartphone and the lack\nof killer applications which is limited to phone unlock and online payment. Instead of 3D sensing, most of\nthe Android phone makers have chosen the lower cost finger print technology which can achieve similar\nphone unlock and online payment functions with somewhat compromised user experience.\n55\nBeing a leading provider of 3D sensing technology, Himax is also an active participant in smartphone\nOEMs’ design projects for new devices involving ToF technology. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption\nby smartphone makers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension\nmeasurement and 3D depth information generation for AR. Unlike structured light 3D sensing where we\nprovide total solution or just projector module or optics depending on customers’ needs, with ToF, we will\nonly focus on transmitter module by leveraging our WLO related expertise. In the past few months, we have\nbeen actively working with an industry leading ToF 3D camera vendor to develop a new and advanced ToF\nsolution, targeting Android smartphones. Leveraging on our WLO technology, we have made great progress\nproviding the partner with spot projector for their reference design which will be ready for leading Android\nsmartphone makers’ evaluation as soon as first quarter of 2020.\nWe reported at second quarter 2019 earnings call on August 7, we have adjusted our structured light-\nbased 3D sensing technology development to focus on applications for non-smartphone segments which are\ntypically less sensitive to cost and always require a total solution.\n3D sensing can have a wide range of applications beyond smartphone. We have started to explore\nbusiness opportunities in various industries by leveraging our structured light 3D sensing total solution. Such\nindustries are typically less sensitive to cost and always require a total solution. Our current non-smartphone\n3D-sensing engagements have focused on smart door lock and industrial automation segments where we\nprovide structured light-based 3D sensing total solution. We have been collaborating closely mainly with\ntwo types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial recognition algorithm and those offering\napplication processors with strong AI capability. We have started design-in projects with several smart door\nlock end customers. Separately, as we previously mentioned, we are working with partners who wish to take\nadvantage of our 3D sensing know-how to achieve efficiency improvement and cost reduction in traditional\nmanufacturing. One market opportunity we are pursuing is shoe factory automation. The prototypes of 3D\nsensing enabled automatic robotic cementing system are available now for production optimization testing.\nOur critical 3D sensing Technologies include the followings.\nWafer Level Optics Products\nWLO is one of the key technologies enabling 3D sensing, AR goggle devices, and many other\napplications. At present, 3D sensing is the top priority of our WLO business. Levering on our exceptional\ndesign know-how and mass production experience in WLO technology, we are able to produce the world’s\nmost compact optics required of 3D sensing while achieving superior performance and lower costs.\nASIC\nOne of the critical elements of our 3D sensing total solution is an ASIC for 3D depth map generation.\nWe are able to develop the ASIC thanks to our unique in-house capability in developing video ASICs for\ncustomers. Equipped with the ASIC, our 3D sensing total solution can substantially reduce the power\nconsumed while processing 3D sensing, enhance personal data security, accelerate the 3D depth map\ngeneration, and provide the superior depth data output match with our optical component. We view this\nunique capability as a significant competitive advantage. It has been and will continue to be one of our key\ndrivers in the success of our 3D sensing total solution.\nActive Alignment\nWith much experience in optical assembly for AR and VR devices, our factory has developed a system\nto do active alignment for tiny components. From the incoming quality check, assembly process, and testing,\nall steps are monitored and checked. The precision assembly capability gives us a very good foundation to do\nthe optical assembly for DOE, WLO, and laser.\nLaser Driver\n56\nBased on our expertise in projector, optics, and driver, we have designed a special Glass Broken\nDetection (“GBD”) mechanism on our projector. With the support from laser driver, it can cease the laser to\nprevent users from being exposed to higher power laser energy.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our SLiMTM 3D sensing total solutions:\nProduct Features\nSLiMTM 3D sensing total solution • Dot projector: More than 33,000 invisible dots, the highest\nin the industry, projected onto object to build the most\nsophisticated 3D depth map among all structured light solutions\n• Depth map accuracy: Error rate of < 0.5% within the entire\noperation range of 30cm-100cm\n• Face recognition: Enabled by the most sophisticated 3D depth\ndata to build unique facial map that can be used for instant\nunlock and secure online payment\n• Indoor/outdoor sensitivity: Superior sensing capability even\nunder total darkness or bright sunlight\n• Eye safety: Certified for IEC 60825 Class 1, the international\nlaser product standard which governs laser product safety under\nall conditions of normal use with naked eyes\n• Glass broken detection: Patented glass broken detection\nmechanism in the dot projector whereby laser is shut down\ninstantaneously in the event of broken glass in the projector\n• Power consumption: Less than 400mW for projector, sensor\nand depth decoding combined, making it the lowest power\nconsuming 3D sensing device by far among all structured light\nsolutions\n• Module size: the smallest structured light solution in the\nmarket, ideal for embedded and mobile device integration\nUltra-low power smart sensing\nThe demand for always-on battery-powered smart devices with AI intelligent sensing is rapidly growing.\nBy combining an ultra-low-power image sensor with a custom computer vision ASIC and machine-learning\nalgorithms, Himax WiseEye® is helping to enrich connected devices with AI. With an always-on camera\noptimized algorithm performance, the system consumes less than 1mW and is leading the industry in next-\ngeneration, battery operated, clever visual sensors. The WiseEye total solution is also being evaluated in\nvariety of applications, security, smart building, industrial and automotive are only few. Currently laptop is\nthe market of focus. Himax WiseEye 2.0 NB solution provides a ‘laptop-ready’ 3-in-1 RGB/IR/AI solution,\nrespecting privacy while enhancing security for notebook users. At the CES 2020, several leading notebook\nOEMs and ODMs demonstrated our WiseEye NB solution in their next generation premium notebooks with\npositive feedback.\nIn addition to notebook, we have also made progress in the displays and IoT markets. Innolux, one of the\nworld's leading manufacturers of TFT-LCD displays, has integrated the Himax-Emza WiseEye solution into\ndisplays to enable consumer privacy protection in real time. Chicony, one of the largest ODMs in the world,\nand Emza jointly announced a reference design of the world’s first battery-powered human sensing solution\nfor IoT in December 2019. Both Innolux and Chicony showcased their products at the CES. Except for\nproviding total solution, Himax is also able to offer ultra-low power smart sensing on the basis of individual\nparts so as to address the market’s different needs and maximize the potential opportunities for Himax.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our ultra-low power smart sensing - WiseEye total\nsolutions:\n57\nProduct Features\nWiseEye ULP AI based total • Ideal for battery operated devices enables always on mode of\nsolution operation supporting both continuous operation and periodic\nwakeup mode, enabling long battery life\n• Total solution supports use of a variety of Himax CMOS image\nsensors – HM01B0 qVGA, HM0360 VGA and HM11B1 RGB/\nIR/AI hybrid sensor.

Processing at the edge: motion\ndetection, human detection and face detection.\n• Emza computer vision algorithms, a lean machine learning\nframework. Sensor is trainable for desired use cases (human\nfull body, human upper body, face). Works on ultra-low\ncompute resources platform (CPU clock, internal memory)\n• Total solution support Zoning capabilities and ignores events in\nnon-relevant space.\nHimax’s proprietary computer vision processor, WiseEye WE-I Plus, is an AI-enabled ASIC platform\nsolution. It can support popular machine learning frameworks, such as Google Tensor Flow lite, for the\nsystem customer to develop a wide range of video and audio AI applications where power is a strict\nconstraint and on-device memory is limited. Typical applications include smart home applications and\nsurveillance systems. Besides from providing edge AI ASIC platform solutions to end customers to build\ntheir own solutions, WiseEye WE-I Plus ASIC also work with some first-tier voice and image algorithm\nsolution venders and system integration vendors to build up ECO system to provide turn-key solutions. There\nare four target markets in which we already have established the total solutions and work with some brand\nname companies, including AI TV, Smart Air conditioner, Smart door lock and Smart Surveillance.\nThe following table sets forth the features of our WiseEye WE-I Plus ASIC product:\nProduct Features\nWiseEye WE-I Plus ASIC • Ultra-low power consumption: 40 uW/MHz\n• Support image, voice trigger simultaneously to wake up system\n• Optimized multi-layer power states for always-on applications\n• Ready-for- use software package and Machine Learning\nLibrary, including device driver, SDK and embARC Machine\nLearning Inference Library to support Google TensorFlow Lite\nMicro framework\n• ARC-EM9D 32-bit DSP: Frequency up to 400MHz,\n• Memory: Up to 2MByte SRAM\n• High performance pixel processing accelerator and JPEG codec\n• Security Engine: Support secure boot, secure FW update,\nsecure debug mode, Support AES 128bits, RSA 2048bits,\nHash-256, TRNG, Secure key management\n• Peripheral: 1/4/8-bit camera interface, I2C/SPI master/slave,\nUART, PWM, GPIO with 5 wake-up pins, 12-bit ADC with 4\nchannels, up to 1Msps, RTC Timer\nCore Technologies and Know-How\nDriving System Technology. Through our collaboration with panel manufacturers, we have developed\nextensive knowledge of circuit design, TFT-LCD driving systems, high-voltage processes and display\nsystems, all of which are important to the design of high-performance TFT-LCD display drivers. Our\nengineers have in-depth knowledge of the driving system technology, which is the architecture for the\n58\ninteraction between the source driver, gate driver, timing controller and power systems as well as other\npassive components. We believe that our understanding of the entire driving system has strengthened our\ndesign capabilities. Our engineers are highly skilled in designing power efficient and compact display drivers\nthat enhance the performance of TFT-LCD. We are leveraging our know-how of display drivers and driving\nsystem technology to develop display drivers for panels utilizing other technologies such as OLED.\nHigh-Voltage CMOS Circuit Design. Unlike most other semiconductors, TFT-LCD display drivers\nrequire a high output voltage of 3.3 to 50 volts. We have developed circuit design technologies using a high-\nvoltage CMOS process that enables us to produce high-yield, reliable and compact drivers for high-volume\napplications. Moreover, our technologies enable us to keep the driving voltage at very high uniformity, which\ncan be difficult to achieve when using standard CMOS process technology.\n3D Technologies. Several technologies in Himax are integrated together to form our 3D solution. First,\nwafer level imprinted technology is used to design and manufacture DOE and WLO. Then, our in-house\ncapability on semiconductor enable us to design IC particularly match our optical component. Our expertise\nin precision assembly in optics also help us to provide a more complete solution to our customers.\nHigh-Bandwidth Interfaces. In addition to high-voltage circuit design, TFT-LCD display drivers require\nhigh bandwidth transmission for video signals. We have applied several high-speed interfaces, including\ntransistor-transistor logic (“TTL”), Reduced Swing Differential Signaling (“RSDS”), mini low-voltage\ndifferential signaling (“LVDS”), dual-edge TTL (“DETTL”), turbo Reduced Swing Differential Signaling\n(“RSDS”), Mobile Industry Processor Interface (“MIPI”) and other customized interfaces in our display\ndrivers. Moreover, we are developing additional driver interfaces for special applications with optimized\nspeed, lower EMI and higher system stability.\nDie Shrink and LowPower Technologies. Our engineers are highly skilled in employing their knowledge\nof driving technology and high-voltage CMOS circuit design to shrink the die size of our display drivers\nwhile leveraging their understanding of driving technology and panel characteristics to design display drivers\nwith low power consumption. Die size is an important consideration for applications with size constraints.\nSmaller die size also reduces the cost of the chip. Lower power consumption is important for many portable\ndevices such as notebook computers, mobile handsets and consumer electronics products.\nCustomers\nOur customers for display drivers are primarily panel manufacturers and mobile device module\nmanufacturers, who in turn design and market their products to manufacturers of end-use products such as\nnotebook computers, desktop monitors, televisions, mobile handsets and consumer electronics products.\nWe may sell our products through agents or distributors for certain products or in certain regions. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, we sold our products to more than 200 customers. Our ten largest customers together\naccounted for approximately 74.6% and 75.6% of our revenues in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2018 and\n2019, our two largest customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue: customer A and its affiliates\naccounted for 28.1% and 29.5% of our revenues, respectively; customer B and its affiliates accounted for\n12.6% and 8.9% of our revenues, respectively.\nCertain of our customers provide us with a long-term (twelve-month) forecast plus three-month rolling\nnon-binding forecasts and confirm orders about one month ahead of scheduled delivery. In general, purchase\norders are not cancellable by either party, although from time to time we and our customers have agreed to\namend the terms of such orders.\nAs a semiconductor company, we are not immune to a customer’s supplier decision which can work\nin or against our favor. We were informed of a product replacement decision by the anchor customer after\nour fourth quarter 2018 earnings call on February 19, 2019. Foreseeing that WLO shipment volume in 2019\nwould decline significantly starting from the third quarter, we disclosed the information in our 20-F filing in\nMarch 2019. The filing also warned of the additional negative impact the anticipated volume fall-off would\ncause to our 2019 margin and profitability as the substantial cut-back of WLO fab capacity utilization would\n59\nlead to higher equipment depreciation and fab overhead on a per unit basis. As it turned out, we have been\nnotified by the anchor customer of their new decision. Contrary to our earlier warning, our second half 2019\nWLO shipment increased significantly to a scale higher than that of the same period last year. We believe\nthe customer’s earlier replacement decision was a normal occurrence in the semiconductor industry and\nare pleased that its new decision has removed the concerns on the short-term impact over the revenue and\nprofitability of our WLO business. Regardless, we believe such incidents would not affect our long-term\npartnership with the anchor customer. We continue to make progress with our ongoing R&D projects for next\ngeneration products centered around our exceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in\nWLO technology.\nSales and Marketing\nWe focus our sales and marketing strategy on establishing business and technology relationships\nprincipally with TFT-LCD panel manufacturers, panel manufacturers using LTPS or OLED, or Oxide\ntechnologies, mobile display module and mobile device manufacturers and camera module houses in order\nto work closely with them on future semiconductor solutions that align with their product road maps. Our\nengineers collaborate with our customers’ engineers to create products that comply with their specifications\nand provide a high level of performance at competitive prices and also create customized features for\nend brand customers. Our end market for large-sized panels is concentrated among a limited number of\nmajor panel manufacturers. We also market our products directly to monitor, notebook and mobile device\nmanufacturers so that our products can be qualified for their specifications and designed into their products.\nFurthermore, we extend our business development with system and ODM companies by using strategic ASIC\nbusiness model to not only develop ASIC product based on customer specification but also jointly research\nand develop new technologies to meet customers' future product demand. Additionally, we will form a\nstrategic partnership with tier-1 customers for our LCOS microdisplays to penetrate into an emerging market.\nWe believe we need this close relationship with our customers to create a new application eco system.\nWe primarily sell our products through our direct sales teams located in Taiwan, China, South Korea\nand Japan. We also have dedicated sales teams for certain of our most important current or prospective\ncustomers. We have offices in Tainan, Hsinchu, Taipei, Taiwan; and Shenzen and Suzhou, China. We have\nother sales and technical support offices in Hefei, Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Foshan, Fuqing, Ningbo,\nWuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi’an and Xiamen, China; Tokyo, Japan; Asan-si and Bundang-gu, South\nKorea; Givatayim, Israel; and Irvine and Campbell, California and Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, all in\nclose proximity to our customers. For certain products or regions, we may sell our products through agents or\ndistributors.\nOur sales and marketing team possesses a high level of technical expertise and industry knowledge used\nto support a lengthy and complex sales process. This includes a highly trained team of product managers\nand field applications engineers. Our team is equipped with extensive strategic marketing experience and a\nstrong capability to identify market trends. We also provide technical support and assistance to potential and\nexisting customers in system/SoC architecture, designing, testing and qualifying display modules, camera\nmodules and end application systems that incorporate our products and ASICs. We believe that the depth and\nquality of this design support are key to improving customers’ time-to-market and maintaining a high level of\ncustomer satisfaction.\nManufacturing\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and\nassembly and testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-\nperformance semiconductors and rely on semiconductor manufacturing service providers for wafer\nfabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing. We also rely largely on third-party suppliers of processed\ntape used in TAB packaging. We engage foundries with high-voltage CMOS process technology for our\ndisplay drivers and engage assembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages, thereby\ntaking advantage of the economies of scale and the specialization of such semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us to capture certain financial and operational benefits,\n60\nincluding reduced manufacturing personnel, capital expenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us\nthe flexibility to use the technology and service providers that are the most suitable for any given product.\nWe operate a fab under Himax Display primarily for performing manufacturing processes for our LCOS\nmicrodisplays. Moreover, for better integration, we also established an in-house color filter facility under\nHimax Taiwan, which commenced shipments from 2010. This in-house facility provides color filter for\nCMOS image sensor products with over 50 million optics shipment record to tier-1 customers and LCOS\nproducts. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our proprietary single-panel color LCOS\nmicrodisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness of our LCOS products and\ncreates value for our customers. In addition, we have established an in-house WLO facility under Himax\nTaiwan for the key process of our wafer level optics products, which commenced small-scale shipments\nin December 2009. We began construction of our new building, Fab 2, in March 2017, located nearby the\ncurrent headquarters to house additional WLO capacity, the new active alignment equipment needed for our\n3D sensing business and to provide extra office space. The construction of Fab 2 was completed in the first\nhalf of 2018.\nManufacturing Stages\nThe diagram below sets forth the various stages in manufacturing display drivers according to the two\ndifferent types of assembly utilized: TAB or COG. The assembly type depends primarily on the application\nand design of the panel and is determined by our customers.\nWafer Fabrication: Based on our design, the foundry provides us with fabricated wafers. Each\nfabricated wafer contains many chips, each known as a die.\nGold Bumping: After the wafers are fabricated, they are delivered to gold bumping houses where gold\nbumps are plated on each wafer. The gold bumping process uses thin film metal deposition, photolithography\n61\nand electrical plating technologies. The gold bumps are plated onto each wafer to connect the die to the\nprocessed tape, in the case of TAB package, or the glass, in the case of COG package.\nChip Probe Testing: Each die is electrically tested, or probed, for defects. Dies that fail this test are discarded.\nAssembly and Testing: Our display drivers use two types of assembly technology: TAB or COG. Display\ndrivers for large-sized applications typically require TAB package types and to a lesser extent COG package\ntypes, whereas display drivers for mobile handsets and consumer electronics products typically require COG\npackage types.\nTAB Assembly\nWe use two types of TAB technologies: TCP and COF. TCP and COF packages are both made of\nprocessed tape that is typically 35mm or 48mm wide, plated with copper foil and has a circuit formed within\nit. TCP and COF packages differ, however, in terms of their chip connections. With TCP packages, a hole\nis punched through the processed tape in the area of the chip, which is connected to a flying lead made of\ncopper. By contrast, with COF packages, the lead is mounted directly on the processed tape and there is no\nflying lead. In recent years, COF packages have become predominantly used in TAB technology.\n• Inner-Lead Bonding: The TCP and COF assembly process involves grinding the bumped wafers into\ntheir required thickness and cutting the wafers into individual dies, or chips. An inner lead bonder\nmachine connects the chip to the printed circuit processed tape and the package is sealed with resin\nat high temperatures.\n• Final Testing: The assembled display drivers are tested to ensure that they meet performance\nspecifications. Testing takes place on specialized equipment using software customized for each\nproduct.\nCOG Assembly\nCOG assembly connects display drivers directly to LCD panels without the need for processed tape.\nCOG assembly involves grinding the tested wafers into their required thickness and cutting the wafers into\nindividual dies, or chips. Each individual die is picked and placed into a chip tray and is then visually or\nauto-inspected for defects. The dies are packed within a tray in an aluminum bag after completion of the\ninspection process.\nQuality Assurance\nWe maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system. Using a variety of methods, from conducting\nrigorous simulations during the circuit design process to evaluating supplier performance at various stages\nof our products’ manufacturing process, we seek to bring about improvements and achieve customer\nsatisfaction. In addition to monitoring customer satisfaction through regular reviews, we implement extensive\nsupplier quality controls so that the products we outsource achieve our high standards. Prior to engaging a\nthird party as our supplier, we perform a series of audits on their operations, and upon engagement, we hold\nfrequent quality assurance meetings with our suppliers to evaluate such factors as product quality, production\ncosts, technological sophistication and timely delivery.\nIn November 2002, we received ISO 9001 certification, which was renewed in February 2018 and\nwill expire in February 2021. In February 2006, we received ISO 14001 certification, which was renewed\nin December 2017 and will expire in December 2020. In addition, in March 2007, we received IECQ QC\n080000 certification, which was renewed in February 2019 and will expire in March 2022.\nEnvironmental Management System and Safety and Health Management System\nHimax follows closely the global environmental trends, including energy saving and waste reduction, in\n62\nits daily operations. The Company is certified in accordance with ISO14001, OHSAS18001 and ISO14064.\nHimax is a leader in its sector when it comes to the environment and safety, operating under measures\nmuch more stringent than domestic regulations. The Company aims to grow sustainably, delivering\neconomic, social and environmental benefits with its healthy employees.\nHimax has also been tirelessly reducing impacts to the environment and improving safety in its\noperations, specifically targeting product design and waste handling.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Service Providers and Suppliers\nThrough our relationships with leading foundries, assembly, gold bumping and testing houses and\nprocessed tape suppliers, we believe we have established a supply chain that enables us to deliver high-\nquality products to our customers in a timely manner.\nAccess to semiconductor manufacturing service providers is critical as display drivers require high-\nvoltage CMOS process technology and specialized assembly and testing services, all of which are different\nfrom industry standards. We have obtained our foundry services from TSMC, Vanguard, Macronix,\nGlobalfoundries Singapore, SMIC and PSMC in the past few years and have also established relationships\nwith UMC, Nexchip and SKHYSI. These are among a select number of semiconductor manufacturers that\nprovide high-voltage CMOS process technology required for manufacturing display drivers. We engage\nassembly and testing houses that specialize in TAB and COG packages such as Chipbond, Chipmore\nInternational trading company Ltd., ChipMOS Technologies Inc., Nepes Corporation and King Yuan\nElectronics Co., Ltd.\nWe plan to strengthen our relationships with our existing semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nand diversify our network of such service providers in order to ensure access to sufficient cost-competitive\nand high-quality manufacturing capacity. We are selective in our choice of semiconductor manufacturing\nservice providers. It takes a substantial amount of time to qualify alternative foundries, gold bumping,\nassembly and testing houses for production. As a result, we expect that we will continue to rely on a limited\nnumber of semiconductor manufacturing service providers for a substantial portion of our manufacturing\nrequirements in the near future.\nThe table below sets forth (in alphabetical order) our principal semiconductor manufacturing service\nproviders and suppliers:\nWafer Fabrication Gold Bumping\nGlobalfoundries Singapore Pte., Ltd.

In addition, we have registered “Himax and logo”\nas trademarks in Taiwan, China, Europe, Singapore, Korea, Japan and the United States, as well as “EMZA\nVISUAL SENSE and logo” and “WISEEYE” as trademarks in Israel and the United States.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products are, in general, intensely competitive, characterized by continuous\ntechnological change, evolving industry standards, and declining average selling prices. We believe key\nfactors that differentiate the competition in our industry include:\n• customer relations;\n• product performance;\n• design customization;\n• development time;\n• product integration;\n• technical services;\n• manufacturing costs;\n• supply chain management;\n64\n• timely delivery;\n• economies of scale; and\n• broad product portfolio.\nWe continually face intense competition from fabless display driver companies, including Fitipower\nIntegrated Technology, Inc., FocalTech Systems Co., Ltd., Novatek Microelectronics Corp., Raydium\nSemiconductor Corporation, Sitronix Technology Co., Ltd., Silicon Works Co. Ltd., ESWIN, Chipone,\nNewvision,R DJ, Hisilicon and Synaptics Incorporated. We also face competition from integrated device\nmanufacturers, such as Rohm Co., Ltd.\nMany of our competitors, some of whom are affiliated or have established relationships with other panel\nmanufacturers, have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial,\nmanufacturing, technological, sales and marketing, human and other resources than we do. Additionally, we expect\nthat as the flat panel semiconductor industry expands, more companies may enter and compete in our markets.\nFor In-cell TDDI, we compete with Novatek Microelectronics Cop., Synaptics Inc., Focaltech System\nCo., Ltd., and Ilitek Corp.\nFor LCOS microdisplay products, we face competition from OmniVision, Jasper, Citizen, Syndiant,\nKopin, Compound Photonics and RAONTECH. We also compete with alternative microdsiplay technology\nproviders such as Texas Instruments with DLP, Sony with Micro OLED and Bosch with scanning mirror.\nFor power ICs, we face competition from Taiwan companies including Richtek Technology Corp.,\nGlobal Mixed-mode Technology Inc., Novatek Microelectronics Corp., Fitipower Integrated Technology Inc.\nWe also compete with worldwide suppliers such as Silergy Corp., and Rohm Co., Ltd.\nFor CMOS image sensor products, our focus is on machine vision. Competition in this space is primarily\nfrom OmniVision Technologies Inc. and Sony Corporation.\nFor wafer level optics products, we face competition primarily from Heptagon that was acquired by ams AG.\nFor 3D sensing, Himax is one of the few companies that can provide the one-stop solution though there\nare more companies attempting to jump into the game. ams AG will be the main competitor we face in the\nworldwide.\nFor ultra-low power smart sensing WiseEye total solution. The main competition is Qualcomm with its\n“Glance” device. Few additional small size companies develop AI base edge devise. However, Himax is the\nonly vendor who can offer a truly in-house vertically integrated solution comprise with all three building\nblocks required by customers: CMOS sensor, purposely designed MCU and the AI algorithm.\nInsurance\nWe maintain insurance policies on our buildings, equipment and inventories covering property damage\nand damage due to, among other events, fires, typhoons, earthquakes and floods. We maintain these insurance\npolicies on our facilities and on transit of inventories. Additionally, we maintain director and officer liability\ninsurance. We do not have insurance for business interruptions, nor do we have key person insurance.\nEnvironmental Matters\nHimax is required to ensure its products and is obligated to comply with valid regulations and\ngovernmental authorities’ regulatory directives in applicable jurisdictions on topic of Environmental\nProtection. Additionally, Himax Taiwan maintains a color filter facility and a wafer level optics facility\nand Himax Display maintains a facility for our LCOS products as well as Himax IGI operates under the\n65\ndesignated facility related for 3D mask production, where we have taken the necessary steps to obtain\nthe appropriate permits and believe that we are in compliance with the existing environmental laws and\nregulations in the ROC and US jurisdiction applicable. In addition, we have entered into various agreements\nwith certain customers whereby we have agreed to indemnify them, and in certain cases, their customers, for\nany claims made against them for hazardous material violations that are found in our products.\n4.C.

We have also expanded certain facilities for\nLCOS and WLO products to accommodate new customers and new applications located at our headquarters\nin Tainan, Taiwan. In addition, Himax Taiwan owns and operates a fab with 1,431 square meters of floor\nspace in a building leased from Innolux in Tainan, where it established an in-house color filter facility that\ncommenced shipments from 2010. This in-house facility provides color filter for CMOS image sensor and\nLCOS products. The color filter line is a critical and unique process for our proprietary single-panel color\nLCOS microdisplays. An in-house color filter facility enhances the competitiveness of our color-filter LCOS\nmicrodisplays products and creates value for our customers.\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements\nand their accompanying notes included elsewhere herein which are prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n5.A. Operating Results\nFor discussion related to our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and the results of\noperations for 2018 compared to 2017, refer to Part I, Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,\nin our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, which was filed with the\nUnited States Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2019.\nOverview\nWe are a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies.\nWe are a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops,\nmonitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other\nconsumer electronics devices. Additionally, we design and provide controllers for touch sensor displays, in-\ncell Touch and Display Driver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management\nICs, and LCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and head-up displays (HUD) for\nautomotive. We also offer digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors and wafer level optics for\nAR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, ultra-low power smart sensing, which are used in a wide variety\nof applications such as mobile phone, tablet, laptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices,\nhome appliance and Internet of Things. For display drivers and display-related products, our customers are\npanel manufacturers, agents or distributors, module manufacturers and assembly houses. We also work with\ncamera module manufacturers, optical engine manufacturers, and television system manufacturers for various\nnon-driver products.\nWe commenced operations through our predecessor, Himax Taiwan, in June 2001. We must, among\nother things, continue to expand and diversify our customer base, broaden our product portfolio, maintain\nour leading technology position, achieve additional design wins and manage our costs to partially mitigate\ndeclining average selling prices and any other market risks in order to maintain our profitability. Moreover,\nwe must continue to address the challenges of being a growing technology company, including hiring and\nretaining managerial, engineering, operational and financial personnel and implementing and improving our\nexisting administrative, financial and operations systems.\n68\nWe operate primarily in a fabless business model that utilizes substantially third-party foundry and\nassembly and testing capabilities. We leverage our experience and engineering expertise to design high-\nperformance semiconductors and rely largely on third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nfor wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing with the exception of manufacturing of LCOS\nmicrodisplay, wafer level optics products and active alignment for 3D sensing, which we manufacture\nthrough our own factories. We are able to take advantage of the economies of scale and the specialization\nof our third-party semiconductor manufacturing service providers. Our primarily fabless model enables us\nto capture certain financial and operational benefits, including reduced manufacturing personnel, capital\nexpenditures, fixed assets and fixed costs. It also gives us the flexibility to use the technology and service\nproviders that are the most suitable for any given product. For LCOS microdisplay and wafer level optics\nproducts, our in-house factories enable us to protect our proprietary technologies and manufacturing expertise\nin the effort to further expand these businesses.\nAs our semiconductors are critical components of flat panel displays, our industry is closely linked to the\ntrends and developments of the flat panel display industry, in particular, the TFT-LCD panel segment. The\nmajority of our revenues in 2019 were derived from sales of display drivers that were eventually incorporated\ninto TFT-LCD panels. We expect display drivers for TFT-LCD panels to continue to be our primary products.\nThe TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive and is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions. The\naverage selling prices of TFT-LCD panels could decline for numerous reasons, which could in turn result in\ndownward pricing pressure on our products. See “Item 3.D. Key Information—Risk Factors—Risks Relating\nto Our Financial Condition and Business—We derive the majority of our net revenues from sales to the TFT-\nLCD panel industry, which is highly cyclical and subject to price fluctuations. Such cyclicality and price\nfluctuations could negatively impact our business or results of operations.” The revenue expansion of our\nnon-driver products as well as TFT-LCD product trending toward high resolution and any other new product\nintroduction help to mitigate these risks.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur business, financial position and results of operations, as well as the period-to-period comparability\nof our financial results, are significantly affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our\ncontrol, including:\n• average selling prices;\n• unit shipments;\n• product mix;\n• design wins;\n• cost of revenues and cost reductions;\n• supply chain management;\n• share-based compensation expenses; and\n• tax credits.\nAverage Selling Prices\nOur performance is affected by the selling prices of each of our products. We price our products based\non several factors, including manufacturing costs, life cycle stage of the product, competition, technical\ncomplexity of the product, size of the purchase order and our relationship with the customer. We typically are\nable to charge the highest price for a product when it is first introduced. Although from time to time we are\nable to raise our selling prices during times of supply constraints, our average selling prices typically decline\n69\nover a product’s life cycle, which may be offset by changes in conditions in the semiconductor industry such\nas constraints in foundry capacity. The general trend in the semiconductor industry is for the average selling\nprices of semiconductors to decline over a product’s life cycle due to competition, production efficiencies,\nemergence of substitutes and technological obsolescence. Our cost reduction efforts also contribute to this\ndecline in average selling prices. See “—Cost of Revenues and Cost Reductions.”\nFrom 2011 to 2014, smartphone and tablet boom across the world created impressive demand of TFT-\nLCD panels. The phenomenal smartphone market growth naturally invited intense competition in the driver\nIC space, especially in the lower-end segments, resulting in severe ASP pressure. In the second half of 2015,\nover-supply issues happened to the large-sized TFT-LCD panel industry again. As high inventory level\nwas built up in the first half of 2015 along with new capacity ramp from China panel makers, ASP pressure\nbecame intense as a result. In the first half of 2016, our large-sized display drivers suffered from another\nASP erosion due to the oversupply in large-sized TFT-LCD panel industry. Large-sized display drivers and\nsmall and medium-sized panel driver business also experienced ASP erosion from 2017. In addition, our\naverage selling prices are affected by the size and bargaining power of our customers. The merger of CMO,\nthe predecessor of Innolux and TPO could negatively affect our ability to maintain, if not raise, our selling\nprices. In addition, as new China panel makers emerge in the marketplace and continue to expand their\ncapacity, China panel makers’ bargaining power will increase accordingly, negatively impacting our average\nselling price. Our average selling prices are also affected by the packaging type our customers choose as well\nas the level of product integration. See “—Product Mix” below. Lastly, competition level affects our average\nselling prices as well. For example, as competitors have started to enter into the smartphone driver IC space\nand compete aggressively to get market share since the second quarter of 2012, average selling prices of\nsmartphone driver IC for mid to low-end resolution have been under pressure since then. However, the\nimpact of declining average selling prices on our profitability might be offset or mitigated to a certain extent\nby increased volume as lower prices may stimulate demand and thereby drive sales and TFT-LCD panel\nproducts trending toward higher resolution.\nUnit Shipments\nOur performance is also affected by the number of semiconductors we ship, or unit shipments. As\nour display drivers are critical components of flat panel displays, our unit shipments depend primarily on\nour customers’ panel shipments among other factors. Our unit shipments have grown since our inception\nprimarily as a result of our increased market share with certain major customers and their increased\nshipments of panels. Our growth in unit shipments also reflected the demand for higher resolution panels\nwhich typically require more display drivers. However, the development of higher channel display drivers\nor new technologies, if successful, could potentially reduce the number of display drivers required for each\npanel while achieving the same resolution. If such technologies become commercially available, the market\nfor our display drivers will be reduced and we could experience a decline in revenue and profit.\nProduct Mix\nThe proportion of our revenues that is generated from the sale of different product types, also referred\nto as product mix, also affects our average selling prices, revenues and profitability. Our display driver\nproducts vary depending on, among other things, the number of output channels, the level of integration\nand the package type. Variations in each of these specifications could affect the average selling prices of\nsuch products. For example, the trend for display drivers for use in large-sized panels is toward products\nwith a higher number of channels, which typically command higher average selling prices than traditional\nproducts with a lower number of channels. However, panels that use higher-channel display drivers typically\nrequire fewer display drivers per panel. As a result, our profitability will be adversely affected to the extent\nthat the decrease in the number of display drivers required for each panel is not offset by increased total\nunit shipments and/or higher average selling prices for display drivers with a higher number of channels.\nThe level of integration of our display drivers also affects average selling prices, as more highly integrated\nchips typically have higher selling prices. Additionally, average selling prices are affected by changes in\nthe package types used by our customers. For example, the chip-on-glass package type typically has lower\nmaterial costs because no processed tape is required. Moreover, our different non-driver products vary in\n70\naverage selling prices and costs.\nThe proportion of non-driver business would also affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFor the past three years, we have experienced operating losses from our non-driver business. This was partly\ndue to low sales volume during these periods that led to insufficient revenue to fully cover expenses such as\nresearch and development and operating expenses. We expect, however, to ramp up the volume production\nand sales of our non-driver products in the future and generate positive operation income from such non-\ndriver products. In addition, given that our non-driver products have higher gross margins and higher\ngrowth potential than our driver products, we expect the overall profit margin across our product platform to\nimprove.\nDesign Wins\nAchieving design wins is important to our business, and it affects our unit shipments. Design wins occur\nwhen a customer incorporates our products into their product designs. There are numerous opportunities for\ndesign wins, including, but not limited to, when panel manufacturers:\n• introduce new models to improve the cost and/or performance of their existing products or to expand\ntheir product portfolio;\n• establish new fabs and seek to qualify existing or new component suppliers; and\n• replace existing display driver companies due to cost or performance reasons.\nDesign wins are not binding commitments by customers to purchase our products. However, we believe\nthat achieving design wins is an important performance indicator. Our customers typically devote substantial\ntime and resources to designing their products as well as qualifying their component suppliers and their\nproducts. Once our products have been designed into a system, the customer may be reluctant to change\nits component suppliers due to the significant costs and time associated with qualifying a new supplier or\na replacement component. Therefore, we strive to work closely with current and prospective customers in\norder to anticipate their requirements and product roadmaps and achieve additional design wins.\nCost of Revenues and Cost Reductions\nWe strive to control our cost of revenues. Our cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2017,\n2018 and 2019 was 75.6%, 76.7% and 79.5%, respectively. In 2019, as a percentage of Himax Taiwan’s total\nmanufacturing costs, the cost of wafer fabrication was 47.0%, the cost of processed tape was 12.8%, the cost\nof assembly and testing was 39.4%, and overhead was 0.8%. Our cost of revenues may increase as a result of\nan increase in raw material prices, any failure to obtain sufficient foundry, assembly or testing capacity or any\nshortage of processed tape or failure to improve our manufacturing utilization rate or production yield. As a\nresult, our ability to manage our wafer fabrication costs, costs for processed tape, and assembly and testing\ncosts is critical to our performance. In addition, to mitigate declining average selling prices, we aim to reduce\nunit costs by, among other things:\n• improving product design (e.g., having smaller die size allows for a larger number of dies on each\nwafer, thereby reducing the cost of each die);\n• improving manufacturing yields through our close collaboration with our semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers and in our in-house manufacturing facilities; and\n• achieving better pricing from a diversified pool of semiconductor manufacturing service providers\nand suppliers, reflecting our ability to leverage our scale, volume requirements and close\nrelationships as well as our strategy of sourcing from multiple service providers and suppliers.\nSupply Chain Management\n71\nDue to the competitive nature of the flat panel display industry and our customers’ need to maintain\nhigh capacity utilization in order to reduce unit costs per panel, any delays in the delivery of our products\ncould significantly disrupt our customers’ operations. To deliver our products on a timely basis and meet the\nquality standards and technical specifications our customers require, we must have assurances of high-quality\ncapacity from our semiconductor manufacturing service providers. We therefore strive to manage our supply\nchain by maintaining close relationships with our key semiconductor manufacturing service providers and\nstrive to provide credible forecasts of capacity demand and seek for new manufacturing service providers in\ncase of any manufacturer’s capacity shortage. Any disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our\nperformance and could result in a loss of customers as well as potentially damage our reputation.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to\nbe affected by, our share-based compensation expenses, which consist of charges taken relating to grants of\nmainly RSUs as well as stock options and non-vested shares to employees.\nRestricted Share Units (RSUs). We adopted two long-term incentive plans in October 2005 and\nSeptember 2011, respectively, which permit the grant of options or RSUs to our employees and non-\nemployees where each unit represents two ordinary shares. The actual awards will be determined by our\ncompensation committee. The 2005 plan was terminated in October 2010. We recognized share-based\ncompensation expenses regarding RSUs under the long-term incentive plan totaling $6.9 million, $4.1 million\nand $0.1 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. See “—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses.” Of the total share-based compensation expenses recognized, $6.1\nmillion, $3.8 million and nil in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, were settled in cash. We measure and\nrecognize compensation expense for all share-based payments at fair value.\nSet forth below is a summary of our historical share-based compensation plans for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. However, we did\nnot grant RSUs in 2019 but granted stock options to employees instead.\nWe made grants of 1,219,791 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2014. The vesting schedule for\nsuch RSU grants is as follows: 82.57% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the\namount of $9.3 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2015,\n2016 and 2017, which will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 597,596 RSUs to our employees on September 25, 2015. The vesting schedule for\nsuch RSU grants is as follows: 94.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the\namount of $4.5 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2016,\n2017 and 2018, which will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 1,208,785 RSUs to our employees on September 28, 2016. The vesting schedule for\nsuch RSU grants is as follows: 91.93% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the\namount of $9.2 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2017,\n2018 and 2019, which will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 580,235 RSUs to our employees on September 29, 2017. The vesting schedule for\nsuch RSU grants is as follows: 96.91% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the\namount of $6.1 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2018,\n2019 and 2020, which will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\nWe made grants of 676,273 RSUs to our employees on September 26, 2018. The vesting schedule for\nsuch RSU grants is as follows: 97.15% of the RSU grants vested immediately and were settled by cash in the\namount of $3.8 million on the grant date, with the remainder vesting equally on each of September 30, 2019,\n2020 and 2021, which will be settled by our ordinary shares, subject to certain forfeiture events.\n72\nThe amount of share-based compensation expense with regard to the RSUs granted to our employees on\nSeptember 26, 2014, September 25, 2015, September 28, 2016, September 29, 2017 and September 26, 2018\nwas $9.27 per ADS, $7.92 per ADS, $8.30 per ADS, $10.93 per ADS and $5.76 per ADS, respectively, which\nwas based on the trading price of our ADSs on that day.\nEmployee stock options. We made grants of 2,226,690 units of stock option to purchase 2,226,690 units\nADS to certain employees at an exercise price of $2.27 on September 30, 2019. The vesting schedule was\nthat 50% of the options vest half year after the date of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the\ndate of grant. We recognized share-based compensation expenses regarding stock options under the long-\nterm incentive plan totaling $0.3 million in 2019.\nTax Credits\nOur results of operations have been affected by, and we expect our results of operations to continue to be\naffected by, tax credits available to us.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and\ndevelopment expenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of\nthe income tax payable for the current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for\nIndustrial Innovation may not be carried forward.\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further\nextended to December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit\nrate will be 10% of the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject\nto a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for each year.\nDescription of Certain Statements of Profit or Loss Line Items\nRevenues\nHistorically, we have generated revenues from sales of display drivers for large-sized applications,\ndisplay drivers for mobile handsets and display drivers for consumer electronics products. In addition,\nour product portfolio includes operational amplifiers, timing controllers, touch controller ICs, LCOS\nmicrodisplay solutions, power management ICs, CMOS image sensors, 3D sensing solution, ultra-low power\nsmart sensing, wafer level optics products, and ASIC service.\nRevenues from large-sized application totaled $237.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 8.9% year-over-\nyear, representing 35.3% of our total revenues, as compared to 36.0% in 2018. The year-over-year decrease\nwas primarily from panel makers’ ongoing inventory correction driven by weak TV demand and industry-\nwide oversupply. Revenues from small and medium-sized applications totaled $307.4 million in 2019, a\ndecrease of 5.6% year-over-year, representing 45.8% of our total revenues, as compared to 45.0% in 2018.\nCombing TDDI and traditional discrete smartphone driver, sales into mobile handsets application in this\nsegment increased 2.4% in 2019 attributed to the TDDI shipment for smartphone close to double as our\nfulfillment was capped in 2018 by capacity constraint. In 2019, display drivers for consumer electronics\napplications decreased 9.8% mainly due to the decline of automotive business as automotive sales worldwide\ndeclined sharply since fourth quarter of 2018 over worries of economic slowdown and trade conflicts, as well\nas the decline of the tablet and other consumer electronics businesses. Revenues from non-driver products\ntotaled $127.1 million in 2019, a decrease of 7.5% year-over-year, representing 18.9% of our total revenues,\nas compared to 19.0% a year ago.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenues by amount and our revenues as a\npercentage of revenues by each product line:\n73\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nDisplay drivers for large-sized\napplications $ 224,798 32.8 $ 260,540 36.0 $ 237,276 35.3\nDisplay drivers for mobile handsets\napplications 113,591 16.6 112,221 15.5 114,956 17.1\nDisplay drivers for consumer electronics\napplications 191,458 27.9 213,497 29.5 192,495 28.7\nNon-driver products(1) 155,320 22.7 137,347 19.0 127,108 18.9\nTotal $ 685,167 100.0 $ 723,605 100.0 $ 671,835 100.0\nNote: (1) Includes, among other things, timing controllers, touch controller ICs, LCOS projector solutions,\npower management IC, CMOS image sensors, programmable gamma OP, wafer level optics (WLO)\nproducts, NRE incomes, and ASIC service.\nA limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues. For example, Customer A and\nits affiliates accounted for 25.8%, 28.1% and 29.5% of our revenues in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.\nCustomer B and its affiliates accounted for 15.5%, 12.6% and 8.9% of our revenues in 2017, 2018 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nPercentage Percentage Percentage\nof of of\nAmount Revenues Amount Revenues Amount Revenues\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCustomer A and its affiliates $176,728 25.8 $ 202,995 28.1 $ 198,430 29.5\nCustomer B and its affiliates 106,380 15.5 90,844 12.6 59,781 8.9\nOthers 402,059 58.7 429,766 59.3 413,624 61.6\nTotal $ 685,167 100.0 $ 723,605 100.0 $ 671,835 100.0\nThe global TFT-LCD panel market is highly concentrated, with only a limited number of TFT-LCD\npanel manufacturers producing large-sized TFT-LCD panels in high volumes. We sell large-sized panel\ndisplay drivers to many of these TFT-LCD panel manufacturers. Our revenues, therefore, will depend on our\nability to capture an increasingly larger percentage of each panel manufacturer’s display driver requirements.\nThe sales to panel makers in China have become a significant portion of our revenue due to the Chinese\npanel maker business expansion which started in 2011. We derive substantially all of our revenues from sales\nto Asia-based customers whose end products are sold worldwide. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, approximately\n25.8%, 23.2% and 19.2% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered in Taiwan and\napproximately 61.5%, 66.4% and 70.3% of our revenues, respectively, were from customers headquartered\nin China. We believe that substantially all of our revenues will continue to be from customers located in Asia,\nwhere almost all of the TFT-LCD panel manufacturers and mobile device module manufacturers are located.\nAs a result of the regional customer concentration, we expect to continue to be subject to economic and\npolitical events and other developments that affect our customers in Asia. A substantial majority of our sales\ninvoices are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses consist of cost of revenues, research and development expenses, general and\nadministrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses and share-based compensation expenses. Costs would\nbe greatly affected by product mix.\nCost of Revenues\n74\nThe principal items of our cost of revenues are:\n• cost of wafer fabrication;\n• cost of processed tape used in TAB packaging;\n• cost of gold bumping, assembly and testing; and\n• other costs and expenses.\nWe outsource the manufacturing of our semiconductors and semiconductor solutions to semiconductor\nmanufacturing service providers. The costs of wafer fabrication, gold bumping, assembly and testing depend\non the availability of capacity and demand for such services. The wafer fabrication industry, in particular, is\nhighly cyclical, resulting in fluctuations in the price of processed wafers depending on the available foundry\ncapacity and the demand for foundry services.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of research and development employee salaries,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, costs associated with prototype wafers, processed tape, masks,\nmolding and tooling sets and depreciation on research and development equipment. We expect to continue\nincreasing our spending on research and development in absolute dollar amounts in the future as we continue\nto increase our research and development headcount and associated costs to pursue additional product\ndevelopment opportunities. As a percentage of revenues, our research and development expenses in 2017,\n2018 and 2019 were 17.2%, 17.0% and 17.1%, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of general and administrative\nemployees, including related employee welfare costs, depreciation on buildings, office furniture and\nequipment, rent and professional fees. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will\nincrease in absolute dollar amounts as we expand our operations, hire additional administrative personnel,\nincur depreciation expenses in connection with the increase in office equipment and Fab 2, and incur\nadditional compliance costs required of a publicly listed company in the United States.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries of sales and marketing employees,\nincluding related employee welfare costs, travel expenses and product sample costs. We expect that our sales\nand marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts over the next several years. However, we\nbelieve that as we continue to achieve greater economies of scale and operating efficiencies, our sales and\nmarketing expenses may decline over time as a percentage of our revenues.\nShare-Based Compensation Expenses\nOur share-based compensation expenses consist of various forms of share-based compensation that\nwe have historically issued to our employees and consultants, as well as share-based compensation issued\nto employees, directors and service providers under our 2005 and 2011 long-term incentive plans. The\n2005 plan was terminated in October 2010. We allocate such share-based compensation expenses to the\napplicable cost of revenues and expense categories as related services are performed. See note 19 to our\nconsolidated financial statements. Under the long-term incentive plan, we granted RSUs on December 30,\n2005 to our employees and directors and again on September 29, 2006, September 26, 2007, September 29,\n2008, September 28, 2009, September 28, 2010, September 28, 2011, September 26, 2012, September 26,\n2013, September 26, 2014, September 25, 2015, September 28, 2016, September 29, 2017 and September\n26, 2018 to our employees. We did not grant RSUs in 2019 but granted stock options to employees instead.\n75\nShare-based compensation expenses recorded regarding RSUs under the long-term incentive plan totaled\n$6.9 million, $4.1 million and $0.1 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation\nexpenses recorded regarding stock options under the long-term incentive plan totaled $0.3 million in 2019.\nSee“—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Share-Based Compensation” for further discussion of\nthe accounting of such expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nSince we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries are incorporated in different jurisdictions, we file\nseparate income tax returns. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, we are not subject to income\nor capital gains tax. Additionally, dividend payments made by us are not subject to withholding tax in\nthe Cayman Islands. However, if the relevant bylaws of the PEM rules have been adequately enacted and\nproperly advocated, we may be determined to be within the territory of the ROC and our income tax shall\nbe levied in accordance with the Income Tax Act and relevant tax regulations. Therefore, dividend payments\nmade by us would be subject to withholding tax in the ROC. We recognize income taxes at the applicable\nstatutory rates in accordance with the jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are located and as adjusted\nfor certain items including accumulated losses carried forward, non-deductible expenses, research and\ndevelopment tax credits, certain tax holidays, as well as changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nROC law offers preferential tax treatments to industries that are encouraged by the ROC government.\nThe Statute for Industrial Innovation entitles companies to tax credits for qualifying research and\ndevelopment expenses related to innovation activities but limits the amount of tax credit to only up to 15%\nof the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year, subject to a cap of 30% of\nthe income tax payable for the current year. Moreover, any unused tax credits provided under the Statute for\nIndustrial Innovation may not be carried forward.\nBased on the amendments to the above, effective from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, further\nextended to December 31, 2029, if companies choose to extend the tax credits to three years, the tax credit\nrate will be 10% of the total qualifying research and development expenditure for the current year and subject\nto a cap of 30% of the income tax payable for each year.\nAccording to the amendments to the “Income Tax Act” enacted by the office of the President of the\nROC on February 7, 2018, an increase in the statutory income tax rate from 17% to 20% and decrease in the\nundistributed earning tax from 10% to 5% are effective from January 1, 2018. This increase does not affect\nthe amounts of the current or deferred taxes recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017. However,\nit affected the Company’s current tax expense from 2018, and deferred taxes were remeasured in 2018, the\nperiod of enactment.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, known as the “Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act” that significantly changes the United States federal income tax system. Among a number of\nsignificant changes to the current United States federal income tax rules, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduces\nthe marginal United States corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limits the deduction for net interest\nexpense, shifts the United States toward a more territorial tax system, and imposes new taxes to combat\nerosion of the United States federal income tax base. The Company does not expect the Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates\nused in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS.\nShare-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation primarily consists of grants of non-vested or restricted shares of common\nstock, stock options and RSUs issued to employees. The cost of employee services received in exchange\n76\nfor share-based compensation is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments\nissued. The cost of employee services is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to employees\nand is recognized in earnings over the service period by graded vesting. Share-based compensation expense\nestimates also take into account the number of shares awarded that management believes will eventually\nvest. We adjust our estimate for each period to reflect the current estimate of forfeitures. As of December 31,\n2019, we based our share-based compensation cost on an assumed forfeiture rate of 0% per annum for RSUs\nissued in both 2017 and 2018 under our long-term incentive plan. Additionally, we based our share-based\ncompensation cost on an assumed forfeiture rate of 10% per annum for stock options granted in 2019. If\nactual forfeitures occur at a lower rate, share-based compensation costs will increase in future periods.\nFor our issuance of RSUs in 2017 and 2018, the fair value of the ordinary shares underlying the RSUs\ngranted to our employees was $10.93 and $5.76 per unit, respectively, which was the closing price of our\nADSs on September 29, 2017 and September 26, 2018, respectively.\nFor our issuance of stock options with exercise price of $2.27 per unit in 2019, the calculated value\nof each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that\nused the weighted average assumptions in the following table. We use the simplified method to estimate the\nexpected term of the options as it does not have sufficient historical share option exercise experience and the\nexercise data relating to employees of other companies is not easily obtainable. The risk-free rates for the\nexpected term of the options are based on the interest rates of 1 years and 1.5 years U.S. Treasury yield at the\ntime of grant.\n2019 plan\nValuation assumptions:\n3.5%\nExpected dividend yield\n51.96%-57.79%\nExpected volatility\n1-1.5\nExpected term (years)\n1.69%-1.75%\nRisk-free interest rate\nLoss Allowance for Accounts Receivable\nWe evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable on a monthly basis for collectability purposes. The\nloss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount using the simplified approach under IFRS 9\nwith the lifetime expected credit losses. To measure the expected credit losses, accounts receivable have been\ngrouped based on the days past due, as well as incorporated forward looking information, including relevant\nindustry information. The activity in the loss allowance for accounts receivable for the years ended December\n31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are as follows:\nLoss Allowance\nBalance at Charges Amounts\nBeginning to Utilized / Balance at\nYear of Year earnings write-offs End of Year\n(in thousands)\n2017 $ 1,395 $ 155 $ (1,550) $ -\n2018 $ - $ 290 $ - $ 290\n2019 $ 290 $ 67 $ (167) $ 190\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, and we use judgment and estimate\nto determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period. Due to the rapid\ntechnological changes, we estimate the net realizable value of inventory for obsolescence and unmarketable\nitems at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The\n77\nnet realizable value of the inventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a\nspecific time horizon. The inventory write-downs in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were approximately $12.3 million,\n$17.7 million and $25.4 million, respectively, and were included in cost of revenues in our consolidated\nstatements of profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-financial Assets other than Goodwill\nWe routinely review our non-financial assets at the reporting date to determine whether there is any\nindication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. The\nrecoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less\ncosts to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value\nusing a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks\nspecific to the asset. However, due to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in our business strategy,\nmarket requirements, or the needs of our customers, we may not always be in a position to accurately\nanticipate declines in the utility of our equipment or acquired technology until they occur. Although we have\nthe recurring losses in non-Driver product segment, we remain positive on the long-term prospect of our non-\nDriver product segment, judging by the expanding customer list that covers some of the world’s biggest tech\nnames, and the busy engineering activities going on with such customers. For the years ended December 31,\n2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize any impairment loss on non-financial assets.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication\nthat the cash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is\nallocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that are expected to benefit from the synergies\nof the combination. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the difference is\nallocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other\nassets of the CGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for\ngoodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed\nin subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The assessment\nof impairment of goodwill requires management to make subjective judgment to determine the identified\nCGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the recoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the\nprocess of estimating the recoverable amount of relevant CGU, management is required to make subjective\njudgments in determining the discounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful\nlives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2019, goodwill in Driver IC CGU and WLO CGU was $26,846 thousand\nand $1,292 thousand, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not\nrecognize any impairment loss on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nAccording to the amendments to the Income Tax Act enacted by the office of the President of the ROC\non February 7, 2018, effective starting from January 1, 2018, dividends distributed by a Taiwan company to\nits foreign shareholders are subject to ROC withholding tax, the rate of which increased from 20% to 21%\non the amount of the distribution in the case of cash dividends or on the par value of the ordinary shares\nin the case of stock dividends. The surtax rate for undistributed earnings will be reduced from 10% to 5%.\nHowever, surtax paid on undistributed earnings can no longer be used to offset against the withholding tax\nimposed on the dividend distributed to foreign shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have not provided for retained earnings tax on the undistributed earnings\nof approximately $593.0 million of our subsidiaries since we have specific plans to reinvest these earnings\nindefinitely. The undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are mainly from Himax Taiwan totaling\n78\napproximately $591.4 million as of December 31, 2019. We intend to use accumulated and future earnings of\nHimax Taiwan to expand operations in Taiwan.\nHowever, a deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Taiwanese company can no longer\ndemonstrate that it plans to reinvest indefinitely these undistributed earnings. This amount becomes\ntaxable when we execute other investments, share buybacks or shareholder dividends to be funded by cash\ndistribution by our foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional taxes that\nmight be payable on such undistributed earnings.\nWe are a holding company located in the Cayman Islands and have paid dividends and repurchased\noutstanding shares. To fund such dividends and repurchases, in the past years, we have received cash from\nbank loans and from Himax Taiwan through intercompany borrowings instead of dividends distributed by\nHimax Taiwan. At December 31, 2018 and 2019, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by Himax\nTaiwan were $86.3 million and $86.2 million, respectively, which are not available to fund our ultimate\nparent company’s activities unless the cash is distributed.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, our management is required\nto estimate income taxes and tax bases of assets and liabilities for us and our subsidiaries. This process\ninvolves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from\ndiffering treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes and the amount of tax credits and tax loss carry-\nforward. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the consolidated\nstatements of financial position. Management must then assess deferred tax assets at each reporting date and\nreduce to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions\nare reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of profit or loss as a percentage\nof revenues:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nRevenues 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues 75.6 76.7 79.5\nResearch and development 17.2 17.0 17.1\nGeneral and administrative 3.0 2.9 3.5\nSales and marketing 3.0 2.9 2.6\nTotal costs and expenses 98.8 99.5 102.7\nOperating income (loss) 1.2 0.5 (2.7)\nNon-operating income 3.2 0.5 0.4\nIncome tax expense 0.7 0.2 0.1\nProfit (loss) for the year 3.7 0.8 (2.4)\nLoss attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.3 0.4 0.4\nProfit (loss) attributable to Himax stockholders 4.0 1.2 (2.0)\n79\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues. Our revenues decreased by 7.2% to $671.8 million in 2019 from $723.6 million in 2018.\nThe decrease was attributable mainly to an 8.9% decrease in revenues from display drivers for large-size\napplication to $237.3 million in 2019 from $260.5 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily from panel\nmakers’ ongoing inventory correction driven by weak TV demand and industry-wide oversupply. Revenues\nfrom small and medium-sized applications totaled $307.4 million in 2019, a decrease of 5.6% year-over-\nyear. Combing TDDI and traditional discrete smartphone driver, sales into mobile handsets application\nin this segment increased 2.4% in 2019 attributed to the TDDI shipment for smartphone close to double.\nThe growth was limited due to TDDI capacity constraint during 2018. The display drivers for consumer\nelectronics applications decreased 9.8% to $192.5 million in 2019 from $213.5 million in 2018 mainly due\nto the decline of automotive, tablet and other consumer electronics businesses. Automotive sales worldwide\ndeclined sharply since fourth quarter of 2018 over worries of economic slowdown and trade conflicts.\nRevenues from non-driver products to $127.1 million in 2019 from $137.4 million in 2018, a decrease of 7.5%\nyear-over-year. WLO sales increased offset by decrease of other non-driver products. Our average selling\nprices increased by 3.0%, primarily due to the increase from our core driver IC business. However, our unit\nshipments decreased by 9.9% as a result of the decrease in the driver IC business during 2019.\nCosts and Expenses. Costs and expenses decreased by 4.2% to $690.1 million in 2019 from $720.2\nmillion in 2018. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased to 102.7% in 2019 compared to\n99.5% in 2018.\n• Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues decreased to $533.9 million in 2019 from $554.7 million in 2018.\nThe decrease in cost of revenues was due primarily to a 9.9% decrease in unit shipments in 2019, as\ncompared to 2018. Inventory write-downs, which are included in cost of revenues, increased to $25.4\nmillion in 2019 from $17.7 million in 2018. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased\nto 79.5% in 2019 from 76.7% in 2018.\n• Research and Development. Research and development expenses decreased by 6.6% to $114.9\nmillion in 2019 from $123.0 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in\nthe salary expense and tape out expense $1.8 million. The decrease in salary expense was primarily\nattributable to lower headcount, lower average salaries due to NT dollar depreciation against US\ndollar as we pay the bulk of our employee salaries in NT dollars and lower RSU compensation.\n• General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by 8.5% to $23.7\nmillion in 2019 from $21.8 million in 2018, primarily as a result of increases in depreciation out of\nour Fab 2 building and partially offset by lower RSU compensation.\n• Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 13.5% to $17.6 million from $20.4\nmillion in 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in the salary expense related to\nlower headcount, lower average salaries from exchange rate effect and lower RSU compensation.\nNon-Operating Income. We had net non-operating income of $2.5 million in 2019 compared to $3.6\nmillion in 2018. We recognized finance costs of $2.3 million in 2019 and $1.2 million in 2018, respectively.\nThe higher finance costs was due to higher borrowings amount and higher interest rate.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our income tax expense decreased to $0.4 million in 2019 from $1.0 million in\n2018. Our effective income tax rate decreased to (2.6%) from 14.2% in 2018. The decrease in our effective\nincome tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in pre-tax loss $15.8 million in 2019 from pre-\ntax profit $7.0 million in 2018, income tax benefit for tax credit decreased to $2.7 million in 2019 from $5.3\nmillion in 2018, as well as recognized $1.2 million and $1.1 million income tax benefit for effect of tax rate\nchanges and tax-exempt income in 2018, respectively.\nProfit for the year. As a result of the foregoing, our loss for the year was $16.2 million in 2019, versus\nprofit for the year of $6.0 million in 2018 and loss attributable to Himax stockholders was $13.6 million in\n80\n2019, versus profit attributable to Himax stockholders of $8.6 million in 2018.\nSegment Results\nThe following table sets forth the revenues and operating results for our reportable segments for the\nperiods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nSegment Revenues\nDriver IC $ 529,847 $ 586,258 $ 544,727\nNon-Driver Products 155,320 137,347 127,108\nTotal $ 685,167 $ 723,605 $ 671,835\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nSegment Operating Income (loss)\nDriver IC $ 43,021 $ 56,023 $ 29,070\nNon-Driver Products (34,662) (52,638) (47,377)\nTotal $ 8,359 $ 3,385 $(18,307)\nDriver IC Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Driver IC segment decreased by 7.1% to $544.7 million in\n2019 from $586.2 million in 2018. The decrease was mainly from the decrease in display drivers for large-\nsize application and consumer electronics applications. This decrease was attributable to 14.0% decrease in\nunit shipments but partially offset by an 8.0% increase in our average selling price of our driver IC products.\nSegment operating income. Operating income from the Driver IC segment decreased to $29.1 million in\n2019 from $56.0 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in 2019\nas compared to 2018 and lower gross margin.\nNon-Driver Products Segment\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nSegment revenues. Our revenues from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased by 7.5% to $127.1\nmillion in 2019 from $137.4 million in 2018. This decrease was attributable mainly to a 11.0% decrease in\naverage selling price of our non-driver products but partially offset by a 4.0% increase in unit shipments of\nthe non-driver products.\nSegment operating loss. Operating loss from the Non-Driver Products segment decreased to $47.4\nmillion in 2019 from $52.6 million in 2018. The operating loss decreases was attributable mainly to the\ndecrease in salary expense and lower RSU compensation.\n5.B. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe need cash primarily for technology advancement, capacity expansion, paying dividends and working\ncapital. We have historically been able to meet our cash requirements through cash flow from operations and\nborrowings to pay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total current assets of $604.7 million, total current liabilities of\n$380.9 million and cash and cash equivalents of $101.1 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had total\nsecured borrowings of $164.0 million with cash and time deposits of $164.0 million as collateral, unsecured\n81\nborrowings of $57.3 million and did not have any outstanding long-term borrowings. As of December 31,\n2019, we had total unused short-term credit lines of $242.5 million, of which $24.0 million will expire\nbefore the end of March 2020, and $136.0 million belonging to the parent company needs to be secured with\nequal amount of cash and time deposits when borrowing money from banks. We believe that our existing\nshort-term credit lines, together with cash generated from our operations, are sufficient to liquidity needs.\nWe expect to meet our present working capital requirements through cash flow from operations and bank\nborrowings from time to time.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 29,393 $ 4,009 $ 7,656\nNet cash used in investing activities (35,088) (38,266) (47,767)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (41,214) 2,801 35,261\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (46,429) (31,586) (5,382)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 184,452 138,023 106,437\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period 138,023 106,437 101,055\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was $7.7 million compared to\n$4.0 million in 2018. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was mainly due to an\nincrease in cash collected from customers in 2019 compared to 2018.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was $47.8 million compared to $38.3\nmillion in 2018. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was due primarily to decrease in net\neffect of cash provided by disposal of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in 2019 compared to\n2018.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $35.3 million compared to\n$2.8 million in 2018. This increase was due primarily to an increase in unsecured borrowings $17.2 million in\n2019 and distribution of cash dividends of $17.2 million in 2018. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted\nby a decrease in demand for our products that are subject to rapid technological change, among other factors,\nwhich could result in revenue variability in future periods. In addition, we have at times agreed to extend\nthe payment terms for certain of our customers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment\nterms and we may grant such requests for extensions in the future. The extension of payment terms for our\ncustomers could adversely affect our cash flow, liquidity and our operating results. Our subsidiaries’ ability\nto distribute dividends and other payments to us may be limited by ROC regulations. See “Risk Factors —\nRisks Related to Our Holding Company Structure — Our ability to receive dividends and other payments\nor funds from our subsidiaries may be restricted by commercial, statutory and legal restrictions, and thereby\nmaterially and adversely affect our ability to grow, fund investments, make acquisitions, pay dividends and\notherwise fund and conduct our business.”\nOur capital expenditures were incurred primarily in connection with the purchase of property and\nequipment. Our capital expenditures totaled $39.3 million, $49.7 million and $45.9 million in 2017, 2018 and\n2019, respectively, higher than usual capital expenditure due to our Fab 2 construction and WLO capacity\nexpansion. Capital expenditures of $45.9 million in 2019, of which $7.3 million was for the investment\nof design tools and R&D related equipment related to our traditional IC design business. Other capital\nexpenditures, mainly consisted of $27.5 million payment for land purchase, and ongoing payments for our\nFab 2 construction and WLO capacity expansion.\nThe capex budget will be funded through our internal resources and banking facilities, if so needed. We\nwill continue to make capital expenditures to meet the expected growth of our operations. We believe that our\nworking capital and borrowings under our existing and future credit lines should be sufficient for our present\nrequirements.\n82\n5.C. Research and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on improving and enhancing our core technologies and\nknow-how relating to the semiconductor solutions we offer to the flat panel display industry. In particular,\nwe have committed a significant portion of our resources to the research and development of non-driver\nproducts because we believe in the long-term business prospects of such products and are committed\nto continuing to diversify our product portfolio. Although a significant portion of the resources at our\nintegrated circuit design center are invested in advanced research for future products, we continue to invest\nin improving the performance and reducing the costs of our existing products. Our application engineers,\nwho provide on-system verification of semiconductors and product specifications, and field application\nengineers, who provide on-site engineering support at our customers’ offices or factories, work closely with\npanel manufacturers to co-develop display solutions for their electronic devices. In 2017, 2018 and 2019,\nwe incurred research and development expenses of $117.7 million, $123.0 million and $114.9 million,\nrespectively, representing 17.2%, 17.0% and 17.1% of our revenues, respectively.\n5.D. Trend Information\n2019 has been a challenging year for Himax. Uncertainty in the global economy overshadowed the\nmarketplace, where we saw waning demand in all industries that consume display. This, combined with\nthe prevailing LCD industry capacity oversupply, had led to severe pricing pressure for panels which\ninevitably affected the sales and margin of display driver IC across all major product segments including TV,\nsmartphone and automotive.\nAgainst the backdrop of an unfriendly market environment, we have faced multiple challenges that have\nhad an adverse effect on our overall financial performance in 2019. First, the large display driver IC and\nsmall/medium driver IC markets experienced chip-on-film (COF) and wafer capacity shortages, respectively.\nThe severe shortages significantly affected our ability to fulfill customer orders in the second half of 2018,\nwhich not only impacted our 2018 sales but also jeopardized our ability to win new projects with customers\nat that point of time. While these constraints were resolved towards the end of 2018, we are still suffering\nfrom the repercussions of the loss of new projects as we did not get to take part in the mass production of\nthose projects.\nSecond, since early of 2019, there has been a major pullback in demand for our DDICs as panel makers,\nfacing an industry-wide overcapacity and uncertain economic outlook due to US/China trade conflict, cut\nback their production and, in the meantime, attempted to lower the DDIC inventory which they built earlier\nto address the IC shortage concern. The combination of these two factors has negatively impacted our\nperformance in the second half of 2018 as well as full-year 2019. Separately in the smartphone segment, new\nmodel opportunities, which we count on to boost our new generation TDDI product shipment, have been\nlimited in 2019 due to a slow smartphone market. As a result, our overall sales and outlook were weak. In\nthe fourth quarter of 2019, however, we have started to see major turnaround in literally all aspects of our\nbusinesses.\nLarge-sized Display Driver IC Segment\nSensing strong signs of panel price recovery, panel makers began to replenish their inventory and\nincrease production starting the end of fourth quarter of 2019. Our leading Chinese panel customers are\nparticularly active in gaining further market share, taking advantage of Korean panel makers’ ongoing fab\nrestructuring by getting out TFT LCD into OLED market segment. As the leading IC supplier, Himax is well\npositioned to benefit from increased demand coming out of the major Chinese large display players. These\nmarket trends, that began to emerge during the fourth quarter of 2019, are expected to drive strong results in\nthe first quarter of 2020 that will accelerate throughout 2020.\nOn the supply side, Himax and some of our major panel customers were already seeing foundry capacity\nshortage of 8-inch silicon wafers for display driver ICs. In anticipation of this, we have strategically prepared\n83\nto ready our 12-inch foundry, as well as associated backend packaging and testing, ahead of our peers to\ncover the potential 8-inch capacity shortfall. Our design project coverage is strong across all leading Chinese\npanel makers. We are very positive on the business outlook for our large display driver for 2020.\nLooking at technology development, all top-tier TV brands have been trying to boost sales for 8K models\nin 2020. At the CES 2020, many of these brands showcased 8K TV’s that contained Himax’s technology.\nAlthough the penetration of 8K TV’s is still low, we expect this to be a strategic opportunity for Himax as 8K\nTV sales will boost demand for not just our driver IC but also timing controller contents. Large display driver\nIC business enjoyed strong growth in the second half of 2018 as 4K TV penetration continued to rise globally\nand China continued to ramp brand new advanced generation LCD fabs.\nSmall and Medium-Sized Display Driver IC Segment\nIn the smartphone segment, our TDDI product roadmap as well as new design-wins with end customers\nand a foundry capacity advantage have positioned Himax to gain market share starting the first quarter and\nthroughout 2020. Furthermore, the smartphone market continues to embrace new technologies and is moving\ntoward higher frame rate displays to enable smoother screen viewing and gaming experience. This will drive\nthe adoption of next generation high frame rate TDDI solutions, for which Himax is a leading technology\nprovider. Also, the demand for 5G in China is expected to drive worldwide smartphone growth in 2020 which\nwill in turn stimulate the growth for TDDI. All these trends will benefit Himax. Separately, the price erosion\nof TDDI we have seen over the past year is expected to abate in 2020. This is not only because the new high\nframe rate products enjoy a higher ASP but also due to the industry-wide tightening of foundry capacity for\nTDDI. As a reminder, during 2018 the Himax TDDI business was negatively impacted by a severe foundry\ncapacity shortage that resulted in our inability to meet customers’ delivery requirements. Although the\ncapacity constraint was resolved toward the end of 2018, the delay limited our ability to participate in major\ndesign-in opportunities that would have driven the business in 2019. The actions we took in 2018-2019 to\ndevelop and enable an additional qualified foundry partner ahead of our peers, combined with our superior\ntechnology and customer collaboration, now uniquely position Himax to benefit from a tightening of overall\nTDDI foundry capacity in 2020. We are well-prepared to meet TDDI production demands and continue to\nmove forward with plans to enable additional capacity this year to capitalize on the strong opportunities for\nsmartphone TDDI, as well as other TDDI applications such as tablet, in 2020. Regardless of the coronavirus,\nwe are confident that our both TDDI business will grow strongly from last year.\nAs expected, our traditional discrete driver IC sales into smartphone declined in 2019 as the market is\nbeing quickly replaced by TDDI and AMOLED. On AMOLED product line, as discussed previously, a major\ndevelopment we are seeing in the marketplace is increased utilization of the OLED display for smartphone.\nThis is due to expanded AMOLED capacity as well as increased demand for under-display fingerprint\ntechnology that is only available in the AMOLED display for the time being. We are encouraged by the\nprogress we have made, collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China for AMOLED product\ndevelopment. We believe AMOLED driver ICs will soon become one of the major growth engines for our\nsmall panel driver IC business.\nIn the automotive display segment, the number of displays per vehicle continues to rise as the overall\nautomobile display market is set to increase from 2020 onward, despite that the global car sales are forecast\nto decline again this year. More importantly for Himax, the market is quickly shifting towards a number of\nnew technologies including higher resolution, in-cell touch, slim border, giant pillar-to-pillar screen, local\ndimming for higher contrast, and plastic AMOLED for free form design, all of which are contributing to an\nincrease in market size and demand for automotive display driver ICs. Himax commands more than 30% of\nthe global automotive display driver IC market and is the primary partner for most of the world’s automotive\npanel makers to enable the new technologies above. It’s worth mentioning that Himax is also the dominant\nautomotive TDDI technology provider, working as the sole supplier on numerous TDDI design-in projects\nacross different leading panel makers. While we expect only small volume shipments in 2020, we anticipate\nmeaningful volume of automotive TDDI as we move into 2021.\nLastly, we expect the tablet business to be a major growth area for Himax during 2020 with a significant\n84\nvolume of tablet TDDI shipment starting from first quarter of 2020. The strong momentum will accelerate\ninto second quarter of 2020 and throughout 2020. The business growth will be driven primarily by leading\nnon-iOS brands’ rapid adoption of the newly developed in-cell TDDI solutions. In-cell TDDI is quickly\nbecoming mainstream for tablets due to its lower cost and a simplified supply chain as well as faster and\neasier integration for display manufacturers. At the same time, consumer demand is expected to accelerate for\nthese cheaper, slimmer, lighter and more stylish tablets. Himax is the primary partner for all non-iOS tablet\nin-cell TDDI products right now and we are already making shipments of our new in-cell TDDI products for\ntablet to a number of leading end customers, some of which include active stylus. Additionally, we continue\nshipping our traditional display driver IC with COF packaging for larger-sized tablets with slim bezel design\nto a leading Chinese brand customer and expect the momentum for these high-end designs to accelerate\nthroughout 2020.\nThe non-driver category has been our most exciting growth area and a differentiator for the Company.\nWe are devoted to the development, manufacturing and marketing of non-driver products to diversify our\ncustomer base and product portfolio to offer total solutions of image processing and human interface related\ntechnologies in addition to our driver IC products. Our non-driver products delivered the strongest growth\nin 2014 owing to many new product launches and project wins. During 2016, our non-driver businesses\nexperienced tremendous growth, primarily driven by the LCOS and WLO businesses due to shipments to\none of our leading AR device customers. Additionally, our WLO business hit inflection in the middle of 2017\nwhen we began mass shipment to an anchor customer. The overall 2018 shipment increased considerably\nyear-over-year because of the customer’s large-scale adoption in more models. In 2019, we continued the\nstrong shipment momentum from 2018 to fulfill anchor customer’s higher demand with a significant year-\nover-year increase. We continue to make progress with our ongoing R&D projects for next generation\nproducts centered around our exceptional design know-how and mass production expertise in WLO\ntechnology.\n3D sensing in the smartphone segment, we have advanced our WLO optics solution to cover both\nstructured light and time-of-flight (ToF) 3D sensing. We are seeing increasing ToF adoption by smartphone\nmakers for world-facing cameras to enable advanced photography, distance/dimension measurement and 3D\ndepth information generation for AR. In the past few months, we have been actively working with an industry\nleading ToF 3D camera vendor to develop a new and advanced ToF solution, targeting Android smartphones.\nLeveraging on our WLO technology, we have made great progress providing the partner with spot projector\nfor their reference design which will be ready for leading Android smartphone makers’ evaluation as soon\nas first quarter of 2020. Our non-smartphone 3D-sensing engagements have focused on smart door lock and\nindustrial automation segments where we provide structured light-based 3D sensing total solution. We have\nbeen collaborating closely with two main types of partners: those with industry-leading expertise in facial\nrecognition algorithm and those offering application processors with strong AI capability. We have started\ndesign-in projects with several smart door lock end customers. Separately, as we previously mentioned, we\nare working with partners who wish to take advantage of our 3D sensing know-how to achieve efficiency\nimprovement and cost reduction in traditional manufacturing. One market opportunity we are pursuing is\nshoe factory automation. We are pleased to report that prototypes of 3D sensing enabled automatic robotic\ncementing system are available now for production optimization testing.\nRegarding ultra-low power smart sensing, the demand for battery-powered smart device with AI\nintelligent sensing is rapidly growing. WiseEye is our AI-based ultra-low power smart sensing solution, built\non Emza’s unique AI-based algorithm, on top of Himax’s proprietary computer vision processor, WE-I Plus,\nand CMOS image sensor, all equipped with ultra-low power design. Currently laptop is the market of focus.\nHimax WiseEye 2.0 NB solution provides a ‘laptop-ready’ 3-in-1 RGB/IR/AI solution, respecting privacy\nwhile enhancing security for notebook users. At the CES 2020, a number of notebook OEMs and ODMs\ndemonstrated our WiseEye NB solution in their next generation premium notebooks with positive feedback.\nIn addition to notebook, we have also made progress in the displays and IoT markets. Innolux, one of the\nworld's leading manufacturers of TFT-LCD displays, has integrated the Himax-Emza WiseEye solution into\ndisplays to enable consumer privacy protection in real time. Also, Chicony, one of the largest ODMs in the\nworld, and Emza jointly announced a reference design of the world’s first battery-powered human sensing\nsolution for IoT in December 2019. Both Innolux and Chicony showcased their products at the CES. In\n85\naddition to total solution, Himax is also able to offer ultra-low power smart sensing on the basis of individual\nparts so as to address the market’s different needs and maximize the potential opportunities for Himax.\nCMOS image sensor is a critical part of the WiseEye 2.0 NB solution. To support the lean camera\ndesign and high-quality image needed for thin bezel laptops, we have made a 2-in-1 sensor that offers the\nduo capabilities of high quality HD image capturing and ultra-low-power, low resolution visual sensing\nin one single sensor, the industry’s first with the innovative design. With this sensor, laptop makers can\nsimplify their next generation product design and save costs by eliminating the need for an additional camera\nto provide context awareness for a better user experience. Our sensor has also incorporated an RGB-IR\ndesign to enable Windows Hello facial recognition. This new 2-in-1 CMOS sensor is currently available\nfor our partners/customers. In addition, we recently announced the commercial availability of an industry-\nfirst ultra-low power and low latency, backside-illuminated CMOS image sensor solution with autonomous\nmodes of operations for always-on, intelligent visual sensing applications such as human presence detection\nand tracking, gaze detection, behavioral analysis, and pose estimation for growing markets such as smart\nhome, smart building, healthcare, smartphone and AR/VR devices. We are collaborating with leading\npartners within the ecosystem to reduce time to market for intelligent edge vision solutions. Notably, we are\nworking closely with Google and have become the reference design for its world-leading TensorFlow Lite\nAI framework targeting low power edge devices. For the traditional human vision segments, we see strong\ndemand in notebooks, where we are one of the market leaders, and have experienced increased shipments\nfor multimedia applications such as car recorders, surveillance, drones, home appliances, and consumer\nelectronics, among others. Additionally, we have seen increased shipments and new design-wins in the\nautomotive segment covering before-market solutions such as surround view and rear-view camera.\nLastly, on LCOS, we continue to focus on AR goggle devices and head-up-displays (HUD) for\nautomotive. Many of our industry-leading customers have demonstrated their state-of-the-art products,\nincluding holographic HUD, AR glasses and LiDAR system, with Himax LCOS technology inside at the\n2020 CES with positive market feedbacks. Our technology leadership and proven manufacturing expertise\nhave made us a preferred partner for customers in these emerging markets and their ongoing engineering\nprojects in AR goggles and HUD for automotive applications.\nHistorically, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, the first quarter has seasonally been the slowest period\nof the year in terms of sales, often down by more than 10% sequentially. At this time, however, based on\nour current pipeline, we are experiencing decent sales in the first quarter, brushing aside the seasonal factor.\nHowever, the coronavirus outbreak currently taking place in China and all over the world does represent a\nmajor uncertainty to our operations, especially for the short term. We are working extremely closely with\nboth our customers and suppliers in our joint efforts to mitigate the risks. The first quarter guidance provided\nduring our fourth quarter earnings call on February 13, 2020 already included the anticipated impact to the\nbusiness from the coronavirus outbreak which reflects to see some downward adjustments, mainly from\ncertain China-based customers for small-sized display drivers and CMOS image sensors. With vast majority\nof operations located outside of China, our suppliers are largely unaffected by the coronavirus outbreak. The\nfocus there is primarily the logistics management including the customs operations in various ports in China.\nThe situation is still evolving. Notwithstanding the uncertainty arisen from the coronavirus, we are\nconfident that we will see decent growth across the board for all our major product categories in 2020.\nFor more trend information, see “Item 5.A. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Operating Results.”\n5.E.

Board Practices\nGeneral\nOur board of directors consists of five directors, three of whom are independent directors within the\nmeaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules. We intend to comply with Rule 5605(b)(1) of the Nasdaq\nRules that require boards of U.S. companies to have a board of directors which is comprised of a majority of\nindependent directors. We intend to follow home country practice that permits our independent directors not\nto hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present in lieu of complying\nwith Rule 5605(b)(2).\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nTo enhance our corporate governance, we have established three committees under the board of\ndirectors: the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee. We have adopted a charter for each of the three committees. Each committee’s members and\nfunctions are described below.\nAudit Committee. Our audit committee currently consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng, Hsiung-Ku Chen\nand Dr. Yan-Kuin Su. Our board of directors has determined that all of our audit committee members are\n“independent directors” within the meaning of Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Rules and meet the criteria\nfor independence set forth in Section 10A(m)(3)(B)(i) of the Exchange Act. Our audit committee will\noversee our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements. The audit\ncommittee will be responsible for, among other things:\n• selecting the independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted\nto be performed by the independent auditors;\n• reviewing with the independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management’s\nresponse;\n• reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation\nSK under the Securities Act;\n• discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors;\n• reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted\nin light of material internal control deficiencies;\n• annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our audit committee charter;\n90\n• meeting separately and periodically with management and the independent auditors;\n• reporting regularly to the board of directors; and\n• such other matters that are specifically delegated to our audit committee by our board of directors\nfrom time to time.\nCompensation Committee. Our current compensation committee consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng,\nHsiung-Ku Chen and Dr. Yan-Kuin Su. Our compensation committee assists our board of directors in\nreviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our\ndirectors and executive officers. Our chief executive officer may not be present at any committee meeting\nwhere his or her compensation is deliberated. We intend to follow Rule 5605(d)(1)(B) and (2)(B) of the\nNasdaq Rules which requires the compensation committees of U.S. companies to be comprised solely of\nindependent directors. The compensation committee will be responsible for, among other things:\n• reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding our compensation\npolicies and forms of compensation provided to our directors and officers;\n• reviewing and determining bonuses for our officers and other employees;\n• reviewing and determining share-based compensation for our directors, officers, employees and\nconsultants;\n• administering our equity incentive plans in accordance with the terms thereof; and\n• such other matters that are specifically delegated to the compensation committee by our board of\ndirectors from time to time.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee assists the board of directors in identifying individuals qualified to be members of our board of\ndirectors and in determining the composition of the board and its committees. Our current nominating and\ncorporate governance committee consists of Yuan-Chuan Horng, Hsiung-Ku Chen, and Dr. Yan-Kuin Su.\nWe intend to follow Rule 5605(e)(1)(B) of the Nasdaq Rules which requires that nominations committees\nof U.S. companies be comprised solely of independent directors. Our nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee will be responsible for, among other things:\n• identifying and recommending to our board of directors nominees for election or re-election, or for\nappointment to fill any vacancy;\n• reviewing annually with our board of directors the current composition of our board of directors in\nlight of the characteristics of independence, age, skills, experience and availability of service to us;\n• reviewing the continued board membership of a director upon a significant change in such director’s\nprincipal occupation;\n• identifying and recommending to our board of directors the names of directors to serve as members\nof the audit committee and the compensation committee, as well as the nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee itself;\n• advising the board periodically with respect to significant developments in the law and practice of\ncorporate governance as well as our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and making\nrecommendations to our board of directors on all matters of corporate governance and on any\ncorrective action to be taken; and\n• monitoring compliance with our code of business conduct and ethics, including reviewing the\n91\nadequacy and effectiveness of our procedures to ensure proper compliance.\nTerms of Directors and Officers\nUnder Cayman Islands law and our articles of association, each of our directors holds office until a\nsuccessor has been duly elected or appointed, except where any director was appointed by the board of\ndirectors to fill a vacancy on the board of directors or as an addition to the existing board, such director shall\nhold office until the next annual general meeting of shareholders at which time such director is eligible for\nre-election. Our directors are subject to periodic retirement and re-election by shareholders in accordance\nwith our articles of association, resulting in their retirement and re-election at staggered intervals. At each\nannual general meeting, one-third of our directors are subject to retirement by rotation, or if their number is\nnot a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third but not exceeding one-third shall retire from office.\nAny retiring director is eligible for re-election. The chairman of our board of directors and/or the managing\ndirector will not be subject to retirement by rotation or be taken into account in determining the number of\ndirectors to retire in each year. Under our articles of association, which director will retire at each annual\ngeneral meeting will be determined as follows: (i) any director who wishes to retire and not offer himself\nfor re-election, (ii) if no director wishes to retire, the director who has been longest in office since his last\nre-election or appointment, and (iii) if two or more directors have served on the board the longest, then as\nagreed among the directors themselves or as determined by lot.\n6.D.

The following description of the plan is intended to be a summary and does\nnot describe all provisions of the plan.\nPurpose of the Plan. The purpose of the plan is to advance our interests and those of our shareholders by:\n• providing the opportunity for our employees, directors and service providers to develop a sense of\nproprietorship and personal involvement in our development and financial success and to devote\ntheir best efforts to our business; and\n• providing us with a means through which we may attract able individuals to become our employees\nor to serve as our directors or service providers and providing us a means whereby those individuals,\n92\nupon whom the responsibilities of our successful administration and management are of importance,\ncan acquire and maintain share ownership, thereby strengthening their concern for our welfare.\nType of Awards. The plan provides for the grant of stock options and restricted share units.\nDuration. Generally, the plan will terminate five years from the effective date of the plan. But, the\namended and restated 2011 Plan was 2nd amended and restated by extending its duration for three (3) years to\nSeptember 6, 2022, which was approved by our shareholders at the annual general meeting held on August\n28, 2019. After the plan is terminated, no awards may be granted, but any award previously granted will\nremain outstanding in accordance with the plan.\nAdministration. The plan is administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors or\nany other committee designated by our board to administer the plan. Committee members will be appointed\nfrom time to time by, and will serve at the discretion of, our board. The committee has full power and\nauthority to interpret the terms and intent of the plan or any agreement or document in connection with the\nplan, determine eligibility for awards and adopt such rules, regulations, forms, instruments and guidelines for\nadministering the plan. The committee may delegate its duties or powers.\nNumber of Authorized Shares.

The committee may select from all eligible individuals those individuals to whom\nawards will be granted and will determine the nature of any and all terms permissible by law and the amount\nof each award.\nStock Options. The committee may grant options to participants in such number, upon such terms and\nat any time as it determines. Each option grant will be evidenced by an award document that will specify\nthe exercise price, the maximum duration of the option, the number of shares to which the option pertains,\nconditions upon which the option will become vested and exercisable and such other provisions which are\nnot inconsistent with the plan.\nThe exercise price for each option will be:\n• based on 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant;\n• set at a premium to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant; or\n• indexed to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, with the committee determining\nthe index.\nThe exercise price on the date of grant must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the\nshares on the date of grant.\nEach option will expire at such time as the committee determines at the time of its grant; however, no\noption will be exercisable later than the 10th anniversary of its grant date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nfor options granted to participants outside the United States, the committee can set options that have terms\ngreater than ten years.\nOptions will be exercisable at such times and be subject to such terms and conditions as the committee\napproves. A condition of the delivery of shares as to which an option will be exercised will be the payment\nof the exercise price. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after receipt of\nwritten notification of exercise and full payment, we will deliver to the participant evidence of book-entry\n93\nshares or, upon his or her request, share certificates in an appropriate amount based on the number of shares\npurchased under the option(s). The committee may impose such restrictions on any shares acquired pursuant\nto the exercise of an option as it may deem advisable.\nEach participant’s award document will set forth the extent to which he or she will have the right to\nexercise the options following termination of his or her employment or services.\nWe made grants of 2,226,690 units employee stock options to our certain employees on September 30,\n2019 with exercise price $2.27 per option. The vesting schedule is, 50% of the options vest half year after the\ndate of grant and 50% of the options vest one year after the date of grant.\nRestricted Share Units.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n7.A. Major Shareholders\nOn August 10, 2009, we effected certain changes in our capital stock structure in order to meet the\nTaiwan Stock Exchange’s primary listing requirement that the par value of shares be NT$10 or $0.3 per\nshare and in order to increase the number of outstanding ordinary shares to be listed on the Taiwan Stock\nExchange. In particular, we increased our authorized share capital from $50,000 (divided into 500,000,000\n95\nshares of par value $0.0001 each) to $300,000,000 (divided into 3,000,000,000,000 shares of par value\n$0.0001 each) and distributed 5,999 bonus shares for each share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders\nof record as of August 7, 2009. These were followed by a consolidation of every 3,000 shares of par value\n$0.0001 each into one ordinary share of par value $0.3 each. As a result, the number of ordinary shares\noutstanding was doubled and each of our ordinary shares had a par value of $0.3.\nIn connection with the above changes, we also changed our ADS ratio effective August 10, 2009 from\none ADS representing one ordinary share to one ADS representing two ordinary shares. Such change in\nADS ratio was intended to adjust for the net dilutive effect due to the bonus shares distribution and the\nshares consolidation so that each ADS would represent the same percentage ownership in our share capital\nimmediately before and after the above changes. The number of ADSs also remained the same immediately\nbefore and after the above changes.\nAs of February 29, 2020, 344,368,062 of our shares were outstanding. We believe that, of such shares,\n216,555,148 shares in the form of ADSs were held by approximately 31,375 holders as of February 29, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth information known to us with respect to the beneficial ownership of our\nshares as of February 29, 2020, the most recent practicable date, by (i) each shareholder known by us to\nbeneficially own more than 5% of our shares and (ii) all directors and executive officers as a group.\nNumber of Shares Percentage of Shares\nName of Beneficial Owner Beneficially Owned Beneficially Owned\nDr. Biing-Seng Wu(1) 74,579,944 21.7%\nWhei-Lan Teng(2) 21,135,720 6.14%\nAll directors and executive officers as a group(3) 83,361,955 24.2%\nNote: (1) Dr. Biing-Seng Wu directly owns 315,322 ordinary shares.

Additionally, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu beneficially owns 1,607,547 ADSs purchased through Sanfair Asia\nInvestments Ltd. in the open market according to his share purchase plan announced on November 30, 2018.\nAccordingly, Dr. Biing-Seng Wu may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 74,579,944 ordinary\nshares, representing approximately 21.7% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(2) Whei-Lan Teng directly owns 1,335,548 ordinary shares. Whei-Lan Teng beneficially owns 2,643,782\nordinary shares through Renmar Finance Limited, which is an investment company controlled by\nWhei-Lan Teng. In addition, Whei-Lan Teng, may be attributed beneficial ownership of 17,156,390\nordinary shares held in trust by Corenmar Investment Limited for the benefit of her children. Whei-Lan\nTeng therefore may be deemed to have shared power to vote or dispose of 21,135,720 ordinary shares.\nAccordingly, Whei-Lan Teng may be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of 21,135,720 ordinary\nshares, representing approximately 6.14% of the outstanding ordinary shares.\n(3) Numbers of shares beneficially owned by all directors and executive officers as a group already include an\naggregate of 74,579,944 ordinary shares beneficially owned by Dr. Biing-Seng Wu.\nNone of our major shareholders has voting rights different from those of other shareholders.

In 2009, we paid a cash dividend on June 29, 2009 in the amount of $55.5 million, or the equivalent\nof $0.300 per ADS, and distributed a stock dividend on August 10, 2009 of 5,999 ordinary shares of par value\n$0.0001 for each ordinary share of par value $0.0001 held by shareholders of record as of August 7, 2009.\nOn August 13, 2010, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $44.1 million, or the equivalent of $0.250 per\nADS. On July 20, 2011, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $21.2 million, or the equivalent of $0.120\nper ADS. On July 25, 2012, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $10.7 million, or the equivalent of $0.063\nper ADS. On July 31, 2013, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $42.4 million, or the equivalent of $0.250\nper ADS.

On August 3, 2016, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $22.3 million, or the equivalent\nof $0.130 per ADS. On August 14, 2017, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $41.3 million, or the\nequivalent of $0.240 per ADS. On July 31, 2018, we paid a cash dividend in the amount of $17.2 million,\nor the equivalent of $0.10 per ADS. For more information on the stock dividend distribution, see “Item 7.A.\nMajor Shareholders and Related Party Transactions—Major Shareholders.” The dividends for any of these\nyears should not be considered representative of the dividends that would be paid in any future periods or of\nour dividend policy.\nOur ability to pay cash or stock dividends will depend, at least partially, upon the amount of funds\nreceived by us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, which must comply with the laws and regulations of\ntheir respective countries and respective articles of association. We receive cash from Himax Taiwan through\nintercompany borrowings. Himax Taiwan has not paid us cash dividends in the past. In accordance with\namended ROC Company Act and regulations and Himax Taiwan’s amended articles of incorporation, Himax\nTaiwan is permitted to distribute dividends after allowances have been made for:\n• payment of taxes;\n• recovery of prior years’ deficits, if any;\n• legal reserve (in an amount equal to 10% of annual profits after having deducted the above items\nuntil such time as its legal reserve equals the amount of its total paid-in capital);\n• special reserve based on relevant laws or regulations, or retained earnings, if necessary; and\n• dividends for preferred shares, if any.\nFurthermore, if Himax Taiwan does not generate any profits for any year as determined in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in Taiwan, it generally may not distribute dividends for that year.\nAny dividend we declare will be paid to the holders of ADSs, subject to the terms of the deposit\nagreement, to the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, to the extent permitted by applicable laws\nand regulations, less the fees and expenses payable under the deposit agreement. Any dividend we declare\nwill be distributed by the depositary bank to the holders of our ADSs. Cash dividends on our ordinary shares,\nif any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.\n8.B.

Memorandum and Articles of Association\nOur shareholders previously adopted the Amended and Restated Memorandum of Association on\nSeptember 26, 2005 by a special resolution passed by the sole shareholder of our company and the Amended\nand Restated Articles of Association at an extraordinary shareholder meeting held on October 25, 2005, both\nof which were filed as an exhibit to our registration statement on Form F-1 (file no. 333-132372) with the\nSEC on March 13, 2006.\nAt our annual general meeting on August 6, 2009, our shareholders adopted the Second Amended and\nRestated Memorandum and Articles of Association, which became effective on August 10, 2009 and were\nfiled as exhibits to our current report on Form 6-K with the SEC on July 13, 2009. These were adopted\nprimarily in connection with our proposed Taiwan listing to meet the Taiwan Stock Exchange’s primary\nlisting requirement concerning protection of material shareholders’ rights under the ROC’s Company Act and\nSecurities Exchange Act. At the same time, our shareholders also adopted the Third Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, which were filed as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 with the SEC on June 3, 2010 and are substantially the same\nas the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of our company except that our\nauthorized share capital is stated to be $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par\nvalue of $0.3 each, on the condition that it shall become effective if the application made by our company\nto list its ordinary shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange is rejected or aborted. On May 20, 2010, the\nThird Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association became effective as a result of the\ntermination of our primary listing application to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.\nWe incorporate by reference into this annual report the description of our Amended and Restated\n99\nMemorandum and Articles of Association (except for provisions relating to our authorized share capital)\ncontained in our F-1 registration statement (File No. 333-132372) filed with the SEC on March 13, 2006.\nSuch description sets forth a summary of certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association\nas currently in effect, which is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Third Amended and\nRestated Memorandum and Articles of Association. As of the date of this annual report, our authorized share\ncapital is $300,000,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 shares of nominal or par value of $0.3 each.\n10.C. Material Contracts\nWe are not currently, and have not been in the last two years, party to any material contract, other than\ncontracts entered into the ordinary course of business.\n10.D. Exchange Controls\nWe have extracted from publicly available documents the information presented in this section. The\ninformation below may be applicable because our wholly owned operating subsidiary, Himax Taiwan, is\nincorporated in the ROC. Please note that citizens of the PRC and entities organized in the PRC are subject\nto special ROC laws, rules and regulations, which are not discussed in this section.\nThe ROC’s Foreign Exchange Control Statute and regulations provide that all foreign exchange\ntransactions must be executed by banks designated to handle foreign exchange transactions by the Central\nBank of the ROC. There is an annual limit on the amount of currency a Taiwanese entity may convert into,\nor out of, NT dollars other than for trade purposes. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange\ntransactions.\nWith regard to inward and outward remittances (foreign exchange purchased or sold), approval by the\nCentral Bank of the ROC is generally required for any conversion exceeding, in aggregate in each calendar\nyear, $50 million (or its equivalent) for companies and $5 million (or its equivalent) for Taiwanese and\nresident foreign individuals. A requirement is also imposed on all private enterprises to report all medium-\nand long-term foreign debt with the Central Bank of the ROC.\nIn addition, a foreign person without an alien resident card or an unrecognized foreign entity may\nremit to and from Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $100,000 per remittance if required documentation is\nprovided to the ROC authorities. This limit applies only to remittances involving a conversion between NT\ndollars and U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies.\n10.E. Taxation\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income,\ngains or appreciation, and there is no taxation in the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no\nother taxes likely to be material to us levied by the Government of the Cayman Islands except for stamp\nduties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of, the Cayman\nIslands. The Cayman Islands is not party to any double tax treaties. There are no exchange control regulations\nor currency restrictions in the Cayman Islands.\nWe have, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (1999 Revision) of the Cayman Islands,\nobtained an undertaking from the Governor-in-Council that:\n(a) no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income or\ngains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations;\n(b) the aforesaid tax or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall not be payable on our\nordinary shares, debentures or other obligations.\n100\nThe undertaking that we have obtained is for a period of 20 years from May 3, 2005.\nUnited States Federal Income Taxation\nThe following is a description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the U.S. Holders\ndescribed below of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, but it does not purport to be a\ncomprehensive description of all tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular person’s decision to\nhold the securities. This discussion applies only to a U.S. Holder that holds ordinary shares or ADSs as capital\nassets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion does not address any aspect of the “Medicare\ncontributions tax” on “net investment income.” In addition, it does not describe all of the tax consequences\nthat may be relevant in light of the U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including alternative minimum\ntax consequences and tax consequences applicable to U.S. Holders subject to special rules, such as:\n• certain financial institutions;\n• dealers or traders in securities who use a mark-to-market method of tax accounting;\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a hedging transaction, straddle, wash sale,\nconversion transaction or integrated transaction or persons entering into a constructive sale with\nrespect to the ordinary shares or ADSs;\n• persons whose functional currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not the U.S. dollar;\n• entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• tax-exempt entities, including “individual retirement accounts” or “Roth IRAs”;\n• persons that own or are deemed to own ten percent or more of our voting stock; or\n• persons holding ordinary shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or business conducted outside of\nthe United States.\nIf an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes owns ordinary shares\nor ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner\nand the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding ordinary shares or ADSs and partners in such\npartnerships should consult their tax advisers as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of\nowning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative\npronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury regulations, all as of the\ndate hereof. These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. It is also based in part on\nrepresentations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any\nrelated agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. You should consult your tax adviser\nconcerning the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary\nshares or ADSs in your particular circumstances.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a person that is, for U.S. federal tax purposes, a beneficial owner\nof ordinary shares or ADSs and is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or other\nentity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political\nsubdivision thereof; or (iii) an estate or trust the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation\nregardless of its source.\nIn general, a U.S. Holder of ADSs will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of\nthe underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. Accordingly, no gain or loss will be recognized if\n101\na U.S. Holder exchanges ADSs for the underlying ordinary shares represented by those ADSs.\nThe U.S. Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom American depositary shares are released\nbefore delivery of shares to the depositary (“pre-release”) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the\nclaiming of foreign tax credits for U.S. holders of American depositary shares. Such actions would also be\ninconsistent with the claiming of the preferred rates of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received\nby certain non-corporate U.S. holders. Accordingly, the availability of the preferential tax rates for dividends\nreceived by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders, described below, could be affected by actions taken by\nparties to whom ADSs are pre-released.\nThis discussion assumes that we are not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company (as\ndiscussed below).\nTaxation of Distributions\nDistributions received by U.S. Holders with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs, other than certain\npro rata distributions of ordinary shares, will constitute foreign-source dividend income for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined\nin accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. We do not to maintain records of earnings and profits\nin accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, and therefore it is expected that distributions will\ngenerally be reported to U.S. Holders as dividends. Dividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income\non the date of the U.S. Holder’s (or in the case of ADSs, the depository’s) receipt of the dividends. Subject\nto applicable limitations and the discussion above regarding concerns expressed by the U.S. Treasury,\ncertain dividends paid by qualified foreign corporations to certain non-corporate holders may be taxable at\npreferential tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified\nforeign corporation with respect to dividends paid on stock that is readily tradable on a securities market in\nthe United States, such as the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where our ADSs are traded. Our ordinary\nshares are not traded on a securities market in the United States. Non-corporate U.S. Holders of our ordinary\nshares or ADSs should consult their tax advisers regarding their eligibility for taxation at such preferential\nrates and whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at such preferential\nrates. Corporate U.S. Holders will not be entitled to claim the dividends-received deduction with respect to\ndividends paid by us.\nSale and Other Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\nA U.S. Holder will generally recognize U.S.-source capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, which will be long-term capital gain or\nloss if the ordinary shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of certain non-\ncorporate U.S. Holders may be taxable at preferential rates. The amount of gain or loss will be equal to the\ndifference between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the\nordinary shares or ADSs. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules\nWe believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a “PFIC”) for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes for our taxable year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn general, a non-U.S. company will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year\nin which (i) 75% or more of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents\nand royalties) or (ii) 50% or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce,\nor are held for the production of, passive income (including cash). If a corporation owns at least 25% (by\nvalue) of the stock of another corporation, the corporation will be treated, for purposes of the PFIC tests, as\nowning its proportionate share of the 25%-owned subsidiary’s assets and receiving its proportionate share of\nthe 25%-owned subsidiary’s income. As PFIC status depends upon the composition of our income and assets\nand the value of our assets from time to time (and the value of our assets may be determined, in part, based\n102\non the market price of our shares and ADSs, which may fluctuate considerably from time to time given that\nmarket prices of certain technology companies historically have been volatile), there can be no assurance that\nwe will not be a PFIC for any taxable year.\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder held ordinary shares or ADSs,\ncertain adverse U.S. federal income tax rules would apply on a sale or other disposition (including a pledge)\nof ordinary shares or ADSs by the U.S. Holder. In general, under those rules, gain recognized by the U.S.\nHolder on a sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would be allocated ratably over the U.S.\nHolder’s holding period for the ordinary shares or ADSs. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the\nsale or other disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed as ordinary income. The\namount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals\nor corporations, as appropriate, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the tax\nattributable to such allocated amounts. Similar rules would apply to any distribution in respect of ordinary\nshares or ADSs to the extent in excess of 125% of the average of the annual distributions on ordinary shares\nor ADSs received by the U.S. Holder during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder’s holding period,\nwhichever is shorter. Certain elections may be available that would result in alternative treatments (such as a\nmark-to-market treatment of the ADSs). U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers to determine whether\nany of these elections would be available and, if so, what the consequences of the alternative treatments\nwould be in their particular circumstances.\nIf we were a PFIC in a taxable year in which we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year, the\npreferential tax rates discussed above with respect to dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S.\nHolders would not apply.\nIn addition, if U.S. Holder owns ordinary shares or ADSs during any year in which we are a PFIC, the U.S.\nHolder may be required to file certain information reports, containing such information as the U.S. Treasury\nmay require.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of dividends and sales proceeds that are made within the United States or through certain\nU.S.-related financial intermediaries generally are subject to information reporting, and may be subject to\nbackup withholding, unless the U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, the\nU.S. Holder provides a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not subject to backup\nwithholding. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a U.S. Holder will be allowed as a\ncredit against the U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. Holder to a refund,\nprovided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\n10.F. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\n10.G. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\n10.H. Documents on Display\nIt is possible to read and copy documents referred to in this annual report that have been filed with the\nSEC at the SEC’s public reference rooms in Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago, Illinois. Please call\nthe SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the reference rooms.\n10.I. Subsidiary Information\nNot applicable.\n103\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to interest rate risk for changes in interest rates is primarily the interest\nincome generated by our cash deposited with banks. In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risks related\nto bank borrowings.\nForeign Exchange Risk. The U.S. dollar is our reporting currency. The U.S. dollar is also the functional\ncurrency for the majority of our operations. In 2019, more than 99% of our sales and cost of revenues were\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. However, in December 2019, approximately 65% of our operating expenses\nwere denominated in NT dollars, with a small percentage denominated in Japanese Yen, Korean Won, Israel\nnew shekel and Chinese Renminbi, and the majority of the remainder denominated in U.S. dollars. We\nanticipate that we will continue to conduct substantially all of our sales in U.S. dollars. We do not believe\nthat we have a material currency risk with regard to the NT dollar. We believe the majority of any potential\nadverse foreign currency exchange impacts on our operating assets may be offset by a potential favorable\nforeign currency exchange impact on our operating liabilities. From time to time we have engaged in, and\nmay continue to engage in, forward contracts to hedge against our foreign currency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2019, no foreign currency exchange contracts are outstanding.\nITEM 12.

The\ndepositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts\ndistributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The depositary may collect its\nannual fee for depositary services by deduction from cash distributions or by directly billing investors or\ncharging the book-entry system accounts of participants acting for them. The depositary may collect any of\nits fees by deduction from any cash distribution payable to ADS holders that are obligated to pay those fees.\nThe depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are\npaid.\nFrom time to time, the depositary may make payments to us to reimburse and/or share revenue from\nthe fees collected from ADS holders, or waive fees and expenses for services provided, generally relating\nto costs and expenses arising out of establishment and maintenance of the ADS program. In performing its\nduties under the deposit agreement, the depositary may use brokers, dealers or other service providers that\nare affiliates of the depositary and that may earn or share fees or commissions.\nFees and Other Payments from the Depositary to Us\nIn 2019, we received nil from the depositary relating to the ADR program. The payment from the\ndepositary would be intended to cover certain of our expenses incurred in relation to the ADR program for\nthe year, including:\n• legal, audit and other fees incurred in connection with preparation of Form 20-F and annual reports\nand ongoing SEC compliance and listing requirements;\n• director and officer insurance;\n• stock exchange listing fees;\n• non-deal roadshow expenses;\n• costs incurred by financial printer and share certificate printer;\n• postage for communications to ADR holders;\n• costs of retaining third-party public relations, investor relations and/or corporate communications\nadvisory firms in the U.S.; and\n• costs incurred in connection with participation in retail investor shows and capital markets days.\n105\nAppointment of New Depositary Bank\nOn July 14, 2017, we appointed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as our new American depositary receipt\nbank. Effective the same day, our ADR program was officially transferred to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nand the contract is to last for ten years.\nPART II\nITEM 13.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur chief executive officer and chief financial officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required\nby Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our\ntransactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof our financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that our receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our\ndirectors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,\nuse or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of internal control effectiveness to future periods are subject\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, with the participation of our chief executive and chief financial officers, assessed the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange\nAct) as of December 31, 2019 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the\n106\nassessment, our management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nDecember 31, 2019.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHimax Technologies, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Himax Technologies, Inc.’s and subsidiaries (the “Company”) internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated statements of financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, other comprehensive\nincome, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,\n2019, and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”) and our report dated March\n25, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the\naccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the\nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of\ninternal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable\ndetail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n107\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG\nHsinchu, Taiwan\nMarch 25, 2020\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn 2019, no change in our internal control over financial reporting has occurred during the period\ncovered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16.

Amendments to IFRSs and the new interpretation that are mandatorily effective for the current\nyear\nEffective Date\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations Announced by IASB\nIFRS 16 “Leases” January 1, 2019\nIFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments” January 1, 2019\nAmendments to IFRS 9 “Prepayment features with negative compensation” January 1, 2019\nAmendments to IAS 19 “Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement” January 1, 2019\nAmendments to IAS 28 “Long-term interests in associates and joint\nventures” January 1, 2019\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 Cycle January 1, 2019\nThe Company believes that the adoption of the above IFRSs would not have a significant impact on\nits consolidated financial statements. The Company has made certain adjustments upon the initial\napplication of IFRS 16 as follows:\nIFRS 16 “Leases”\nIFRS 16 sets out the accounting standards for leases, which replaces IAS 17 “Leases”, IFRIC 4\nDetermining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and\nSIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.\nThe Company applied IFRS 16 Leases and using the modified retrospective approach from January 1,\n2019. Accordingly, the comparative information presented for 2018 is not restated. It is presented, as\npreviously reported, under IAS 17 and related interpretations.\ni. Definition of a lease\nPreviously, the Company determined at contract inception whether an arrangement is or contains\na lease under IFRIC 4. Under IFRS 16, the Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a\nlease based on the definition of a lease, as explained in Note 4(j).\nOn transition to IFRS 16, the Company elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the\nassessment of which transactions are leases. The Company applied IFRS 16 only to contracts that\nwere previously identified as leases. Contracts that were not identified as leases under IAS 17 and\nIFRIC 4 were not reassessed for whether there is a lease. Therefore, the definition of a lease under\nIFRS 16 was applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019.\nF-13\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nii. As a lessee\nAs a lessee, the Company previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its\nassessment of whether the lease transferred significantly all of the risks and rewards incidental\nto ownership of the underlying asset to the Company. Under IFRS 16, the Company recognizes\nright-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases on the consolidated statement of financial\nposition except for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases, which the Company may\nelect to apply the accounting method like the accounting for operating lease under IAS 17.\nAt transition, lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,\ndiscounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as at January 1, 2019. Right-of-use\nassets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any\nprepaid or accrued lease payments.\nThe Company has tested its right-of-use assets for impairment on the date of transition and has\nconcluded that there is no indication that the right-of-use assets are impaired.\nIn addition, the Company used the following practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to\nleases.\n– Applied the exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than\n12 months of lease term and leases of low-value assets.\n– Excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application.\n– Used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or\nterminate the lease.\niii. As a lessor\nThe Company is not required to make any adjustments on transition to IFRS 16 for leases in\nwhich it acts as a lessor. The Company accounted for its leases in accordance with IFRS 16 from\nthe date of initial application.\niv. Impacts on financial statements\nOn transition to IFRS 16, the Company recognized additional $5,899 thousand of right-of-use\nassets and $5,899 thousand of lease liabilities. When measuring lease liabilities, the Company\ndiscounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019. The weighted-\naverage rate applied is 2.45%.\nF-14\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nPrincipal Activities\nThe Company is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging\nprocessing technologies. The Company is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and\ntiming controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car\nnavigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices. Additionally,\nthe Company designs and provides controllers for touch sensor displays, in-cell Touch and Display\nDriver Integration (TDDI) single-chip solutions, LED driver ICs, power management ICs, and\nLCOS micro-displays for augmented reality (AR) devices and heads-up displays (HUD) for\nautomotive. The Company also offers digital camera solutions, including CMOS image sensors\nand Wafer Level Optics (WLO) for AR devices, 3D sensing and machine vision, ultra-low power\nsmart sensing, which are used in a wide variety of applications such as mobile phone, tablet,\nlaptop, TV, PC camera, automobile, security, medical devices, home appliance and Internet of\nThings.\n(c) Foreign Currency\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the United States dollar (USD). The functional\ncurrency for the Company and its major operating subsidiaries is the USD. Accordingly, the\nassets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the USD are\nincluded in the consolidation by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting currency\n(the USD) at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. Equity accounts\nare translated at historical rates. The statements of profit or loss and cash flows are translated\nat the average exchange rates at the date of transaction. Translation gains or losses are\naccumulated as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n(d) Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash,\nsold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are\nobligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one\nyear from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current\nare noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.\n(e) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash comprise cash balances and demand deposits. Cash equivalents comprise short-term\nhighly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are\nsubject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value. Deposits with an original maturity\nof three months or less at the time of purchase but not for investments and other purposes and\nare qualified with the aforementioned criteria are classified as cash equivalent.\n(f) Financial Instruments\nThe Company shall recognize a financial asset or a financial liability in its statement of\nfinancial position when, and only when, the Company becomes party to the contractual\nprovisions of the instrument. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets shall be\nrecognized and derecognized, as applicable, using trade date accounting.\nF-18\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\n1. Financial Assets\n(i) Classification of financial assets\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial\nassets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are classified\ninto the following categories: measured at amortized cost, measured at fair value through\nother comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and measured at fair value through profit or\nloss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is generally based on the business\nmodel in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics.\nWhen, and only when, the Company changes its business model for managing financial\nassets it shall reclassify all affected financial assets.\ni. Financial assets measured at amortized cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if it meets both of the following\nconditions and is not designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss:\n(i) the asset held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect\ncontractual cash flows; and\n(ii) the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely\npayments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are subsequently measured at amortized\ncost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment\nlosses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are\nrecognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit\nor loss.\nii. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n(FVTOCI)\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the\nCompany may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment’s\nfair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\nEquity investments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends\nare recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents\na recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are\nrecognized in OCI. When an investment is derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss\nin equity will not be reclassified to profit or loss, instead, is reclassified to retained\nearnings.\niii. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value\nthrough other comprehensive income as described above are measured at fair value\nthrough profit or loss.\nF-19\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nSuch financial assets are initially recognized at fair value, and attributable transaction\ncosts are recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, they\nare measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss.\n(ii) Impairment of financial assets\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit loss on financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and contract assets.\nThe loss allowance for accounts receivable and contract assets are measured at an\namount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost\nand contract assets, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount\nequal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial\ninstrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has\nbeen a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is\nrecognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default\nevents over the expected life of a financial instrument.\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and\nsupportable information that is relevant. This includes both qualitative and quantitative\ninformation and analysis, based on the Company’s historical experience and credit\nassessment as well as forward-looking information.\nThe Company recognizes an impairment gain or loss in profit or loss for all financial\ninstruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss\nallowance account.\n(iii) Derecognition of financial assets\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the\ncash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another\nentity.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and\nreceivable is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment\nin an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been\nrecognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings,\nwithout recycling through profit or loss.\n2. Financial Liabilities\n(i) Classification of financial liability\nThe Company classify all financial liabilities as measured at amortized cost, except\nfor financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities,\nF-20\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nincluding derivatives that are liabilities, shall be subsequently measured at fair value.\n(ii) Derecognition of financial liability\nThe Company removes a financial liability from its statement of financial position\nwhen, and only when, it is extinguished-when the obligation specified in the contract is\ndischarged or cancelled or expires.\nOn derecognition of a financial liability at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference\nbetween the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished or transferred to\nanother party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or\nliabilities assumed, shall be recognized in profit or loss.\n(g) Inventories\nInventories primarily consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods awaiting final\nassembly and test and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined\nusing the weighted-average method. For work-in-process and manufactured inventories, cost\nconsists of the cost of raw materials (primarily fabricated wafer and processed tape), direct labor\nand an appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realizable value for raw materials\nis based on replacement cost. Net realizable value for finished goods and work in process\nis calculated based on the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and\nnecessary selling costs.\n(h) Equity Method Investments\nEquity investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence\nover the operating and financial policy decisions of the investee but does not have a controlling\nfinancial interest in the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s\nshare of the net income or net loss of an investee is recognized in earnings from the date the\nsignificant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. The difference\nbetween the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an\ninvestee at investment date is allocated to related assets which are amortized over their useful\nlives. Any unallocated difference is treated as investor-level goodwill and is not amortized.\nThe Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the Company\nceases to have significant influence over an associate, and then measures the retained interests at\nfair value at that date. The difference between the carrying amount of the investment at the date\nthe equity method was discontinued and the fair value of the retained interests along with any\nproceeds from disposing of a part of the interest in the associate is recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen the Company discontinues the use of the equity method, the Company shall account for\nall amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that investment\non the same basis as would have been required if the investee had directly disposed of the related\nassets or liabilities.\nAt the end of each reporting period, if there is any indication of impairment, the entire carrying\namount of the investment including goodwill is tested for impairment as a single asset, by\ncomparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount. An impairment loss recognized\nforms part of the carrying amount of the investment in associates. Accordingly, any reversal of\nF-21\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nthat impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment\nsubsequently increases.\n(i) Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of land, building and machinery and equipment\nused in the design and development of products, and is stated at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Depreciation on building and machinery\nand equipment commences when the asset is ready for its intended use. Except for the following\nparagraph, depreciation is primarily calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of related assets which range as follows: building 25 years, building improvements\n4 to 16 years, machinery 4 to 6 years, research and development equipment 2 to 6 years, office\nfurniture and equipment 3 to 8 years, others 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized\non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nSoftware is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 15\nyears. Land is not depreciated.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then\nthey are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nDuring the year 2017, certain new machinery and equipment have been acquired for specific\nproject. The depreciation on these new assets is calculated on Fixed-Percentage-on-Declining-\nBase Method basis over the estimated useful lives of 3 years. The Company thinks that method\nwould most closely reflect the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits\nembodied in those assets.\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\n(j) Leases (policy applicable from January 1, 2019)\nThe Company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the\ncomparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and\nIFRIC 4. The details of the policies under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 are described separately.\na. Identifying a lease\nA contract is, or contains, a lease when all the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset, and the supplier does not have a\nsubstantive right to substitute the asset; and\n(ii) the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of\nthe identified asset throughout the period of use; and\n(iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period\nof use.\nF-22\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nb. As a lessee\nPayments for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases are recognized as expenses on a\nstraight-line basis during the lease term for which the recognition exemption is applied. Except\nfor leases described above, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability shall be recognized for all\nother leases at the lease commencement date.\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement\ndate. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments,\ndiscounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company determines its\nincremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the\nlease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less\nany lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to\nbe incurred in restoring the underlying asset.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the\nshorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the lease term. The lease liability is\nsubsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured (i)\nif there is a change in the lease term; (ii) if there is a change in future lease payments arising\nfrom a change in an index or a rate; (iii) if there is a change in the amounts expected to be\npayable under a residual value guarantee; or (iv) if the Company changes its assessment of\nwhether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is\nremeasured in the circumstances aforementioned, a corresponding adjustment is made to the\ncarrying amount of the right-of-use asset. However, if the carrying amount of the right-of-use\nasset is reduced to zero, any remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognized in profit or\nloss.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n(i) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments.\n(ii) the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to\nexercise and lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably\ncertain to exercise an extension option.\nMoreover, the lease liability is remeasured when lease modifications occur that decrease the\nscope of the lease. The Company accounts for the remeasurement of the lease liability by\ndecreasing the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or full termination\nof the lease and recognizes in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full\ntermination of the lease.\nc. As a lessor\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease\nare added to the carrying amount of the asset leased.\nF-23\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nLeases (policy applicable before January 1, 2019)\nLeases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the\nrisks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified operating leases.\nAs a lessee\nOperating lease payments were recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the lease.\nAs a lessor\nRental income from operating leases were recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the lease.\n(k) Goodwill\nGoodwill is recognized when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of identifiable net assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment\nlosses, if any.\nGoodwill from acquisition of Himax Semiconductor, Inc. (formerly Wisepal Technologies, Inc.,\nmerged into Himax Technologies Limited on July 2, 2018) in 2007 amounting $26,846 thousand\nhas been assigned to Driver IC cash generating unit (“CGU”) and goodwill from acquisition of\nHimax Display (USA) Inc. in 2012 amounting $1,292 thousand has been assigned to WLO CGU\nbecause these CGUs are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combinations.\nGoodwill is not amortized and instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more\nfrequently when there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s CGU or groups of CGU that\nare expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a\ncash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce\nthe carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such CGU and then to the other assets of the\nCGU pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss for\ngoodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is\nnot reversed in subsequent periods.\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In\nassessing value in use which was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial\nbudgets covering the future five-year period with the terminal growth rate. The annual discount\nrate was 13.59% and 13.3% in its test of Goodwill impairment for Driver IC CGU as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, based on industry weighted average cost of capital.\nThe annual discount rate for WLO CGU was 14.34% and 16.07% as of December 31, 2018\nand 2019, respectively. The terminal growth rate, based on following 5 years average Taiwan\neconomic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was 2.08% and 2.04% used in\nthe test for both CGUs as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The key assumptions\nabovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the related industry by\nconsidering the history information from internal and external sources.\nF-24\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Company did not recognize any\nimpairment loss on goodwill.\n(l) Other Intangible Assets\nAcquired intangible assets include patents, intellectual property and developed technology\nacquired in a business combination. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over the following estimated useful lives: software 2-3 years, patents 15 years, intellectual\nproperty 10 years and technology 7 years.\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and\nadjusted if appropriate.\n(m) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\nThe Company’s long-term non-financial assets, which consist of property, plant and equipment\nand intangible assets, are reviewed at the reporting date to determine whether there is any\nindication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is\nestimated.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use\nand its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows\nare discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market\nassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Considering the\nterminal growth rate if non-financial assets with an indefinite useful life are allocated to the CGU\nin comparison with its carrying amount.\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped\ntogether into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are\nlargely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating\nunit, or CGU”).\nThe annual discount rate was 14.58% and 13.14% in its test of non-financial assets impairment\nwith an indefinite useful life for CMOS CGU as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively,\nbased on industry weighted average cost of capital. The terminal growth rate, based on following\n5 years average Taiwan economic growth rate published by International Monetary Fund, was\n2.08% and 2.04% used in the test as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The key\nassumptions abovementioned represents the management’s forecast of the future for the related\nindustry by considering the history information from internal and external sources.\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its\nestimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. When an\nimpairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU is increased\nto the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not\nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been\nrecognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss.\nF-25\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\n(n) Revenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted IFRS 15, Revenue with contract customers\nretrospectively with practical expedient and transitional exemption. The Company is not required\nto restate contracts that were begin and end within the same annual reporting period. There is no\nsignificant impact on the Company’s financial results in applying the practical expedient.\nIFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with customers,\nusing a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount of revenue\nrecognized. The Company generates revenue primarily from sale of goods or services. Revenue\nfrom contracts with customers is disaggregated by primarily geographical market and major\nproducts.\nUnder IFRS 15, the Company identifies the contract with the customers and recognizes revenue\nwhen performance obligations are satisfied.\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled in the\ntransfer of goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a\nperformance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Customers\nobtain control of the product when the goods are delivered and accepted by customers. Invoices\nare generated at that point in time.\nThe Company’s revenue recognition from product sales is measured at the amount that is highly\nprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not\noccur. Revenue is reduced for estimated rebates and other similar allowances.\nTrade receivable is recognized when the Company is entitled for unconditional right to receive\npayment upon delivery of goods to customers. The consideration received in advance from the\ncustomer but without delivery of goods is recognized as a contract liability, for which revenue is\nrecognized when the control over the goods is transferred to the customer.\nThe Company expects that the length of time when the Company transfers the goods or services\nto the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services will be less than one\nyear. Therefore, the amount of consideration is not adjusted for the time value of money.\n(o) Employee Benefits\n1. Short-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed unless another policy allows or requires it to be\ncapitalized. Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at\nthe undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered\nby employees.\n2. Share-based payment arrangements\nThe cost of employee services received in exchange for share-based compensation is measured\nbased on the grant-date fair value of the share-based instruments issued. The cost of employee\nF-26\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nservices is equal to the grant-date fair value of shares issued to employees and is recognized\nin earnings with a corresponding increase in equity over the service period by graded vesting.\nCompensation cost also considers the number of awards management believes will eventually\nvest. As a result, compensation cost is reduced by the estimated forfeitures. The estimate\nis adjusted each period to reflect the current estimate of forfeitures, and finally, the actual\nnumber of awards that vest.\n3. Defined contribution plans\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognized as an\nemployee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered\nby employees.\n4. Defined benefit plans\nThe Company’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated\nseparately for each benefit plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees\nhave earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair\nvalue of any plan assets. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing\nbenefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit costs (including service\ncost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are\ndetermined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service\ncost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee\nbenefits expense in profit or loss in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising\nactuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in\nother comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized\nin other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be\nreclassified to profit or loss.\n(p) Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. It is recognized in profit or loss except\nto the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in\nother comprehensive income.\n1. Current tax\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or losses\nfor the year and any adjustments to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is\nmeasured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted tax rate at the reporting date.\n2. Deferred tax\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in the financial\nstatements and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply\nto taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nF-27\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nrecognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are\nreviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that\nthe related tax benefit will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of\nfuture taxable profits improves.\n(q) Business Combinations\nAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-related\ncosts are generally recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess\nof the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the\nacquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree over\nthe net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities\nassumed. Non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interests’\nproportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\nAny contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the\ncontingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is\naccounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration are recognized in profit or loss.\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and the resulting gain\nor loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n(r) Earnings Per Ordinary Share\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is computed using profit or loss attributable to the shareholders\nand weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings\nper ordinary share is computed using the weighted average number of ordinary and diluted\nordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent shares are ordinary\nshares that are contingently issuable upon the vesting of unvested restricted share units (RSUs)\nand employee stock options granted to employees.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ordinary share have been calculated as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nProfits (loss) attributable to Himax Technologies, Inc.\nstockholders (in thousands) $ 27,680 8,569 (13,614)\nDenominator for basic earnings per ordinary share:\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding\n(in thousands) 344,849 345,020 345,101\nBasic earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders $ 0.08 0.02 (0.04)\nBasic earnings (loss) per ADS attributable to Himax\nTechnologies, Inc. stockholders(2) $ 0.16 0.05 (0.08)\nF-28\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The number of ADS equivalent outstanding is determined\nby dividing the number of ordinary shares by two. Therefore, the weighted average number\nof ADS equivalent outstanding used in basic earnings per ADS for 2017, 2018 and 2019 is\n172,425 thousand, 172,510 thousand and 172,550 thousand, respectively. Additionally, the\nweighted average number of ADS equivalent outstanding used in diluted earnings per ADS\nfor 2017, 2018 and 2019 is 172,452 thousand, 172,534 thousand and 172,550 thousand,\nrespectively. The earnings (loss) per ADS is presented solely for the convenience of the\nreader and does not represent a measure under IFRS.\n(s) Segment Reporting\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from\nwhich it may earn revenues and incur expenses. All operating segments’ operating results are\nreviewed regularly by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make\ndecisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for\nwhich discrete financial information is available.\nThe Company’s CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer, who regularly reviews\noperating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the\nCompany. Management has determined that the Company has two operating segments: Driver IC\nand Non-driver products.\nF-29\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nThe CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments based on segment sales and\nsegment profit and loss. There are no intersegment sales in the segment revenues reported to\nthe CODM. Segment profit and loss is determined on a basis that is consistent with how the\nCompany reports operating income (loss) in its consolidated statements of operations. Segment\nprofit (loss) excludes income taxes and items in non-operating income (loss).\nThe Company does not report segment asset information to the Company’s CODM.\nConsequently, no asset information by segment is presented.\n(t) Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests are classified in the consolidated statements of profit or loss as part\nof profit (loss) for the period and the accumulated amount of noncontrolling interests as part\nof equity in the consolidated statements of financial position. If a change in ownership of a\nconsolidated subsidiary results in loss of control and deconsolidation, any retained ownership\ninterests are re-measured with the gain or loss reported in net earnings.\n(u) Use of Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires\nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\naccounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future\nperiods affected.\nInformation about critical judgments, estimates and assumptions in applying accounting policies\nthat have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements is included in the following notes:\n1. Valuation of inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses\njudgment and estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each\nreporting period.\nDue to the rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value of\ninventory for obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then\nwrites down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the\ninventory is mainly determined based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time\nhorizon.\nF-30\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\n2. Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill\nIn the process of evaluating the potential impairment of non-financial assets other than\ngoodwill, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\nindependent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the\nspecific asset groups. Any changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions\nor business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future\nyears.\n3. Recognition of deferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits\nwill be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of\nthe realization of the deferred tax assets requires the Company’s subjective judgment and\nestimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, the sources of taxable income,\nthe amount of tax credits that can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Changes in\nthe economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations may result\nin adjustments to the deferred tax assets.\n4. Impairment of goodwill\nThe assessment of impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make subjective judgment\nto determine the identified CGU, allocate the goodwill to relevant CGU and estimate the\nrecoverable amount of relevant CGU. In the process of estimating the recoverable amount\nof relevant CGU, the Company is required to make subjective judgments in determining the\ndiscounted rate, the terminal growth rate, the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected\nfuture revenue and expenses related to the CGU.\nNote 5. Acquisition\n(a) Acquisition of nano 3D mastering related business\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company, through Himax IGI Precision Ltd., completed the\nacquisition of nano 3D mastering related business with total cash consideration approximating\n$1,400 thousand, and half of which, $700 thousand, was paid in 2019.\nThe advanced nano 3D manufacturing masters are primarily used in imprinting or stamping\nreplication process to fabricate devices such as diffractive optical element (DOE), diffuser,\ncollimator lens and micro lens array. The acquisition brings the Company the very upstream\nmaster tooling capability to supplement its world leading wafer level optics (WLO) technology,\nwhich is critical in its efforts to offer 3D sensing total solutions.\nAcquired assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values. Property, plant and\nequipment, other intangible asset and prepaid maintenance acquired were $700 thousand, $400\nthousand and $300 thousand, respectively.\nF-31\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\n(b) Acquisition of Emza Visual Sense Ltd.\nEmza Visual Sense Ltd.(“Emza”) was purchased in April 2017 with an original investment\namount of $2,230 thousand together with an additional investment amount of $270 thousand\nthrough conversion of equal amount of debts which occurred in 2016. On June 28, 2018, the\nCompany completed the acquisition of all the outstanding common shares of Emza with total\ncash consideration approximating $6,371 thousand, including $400 thousand holdback was paid\nin 2019. The Company’s previously held equity interests in Emza was re-measured at fair value,\nwhich was determined with the assistance of an independent appraiser using the equity value\nallocation method at acquisition date. The re-measurement gain on the previously held equity\ninterests in Emza was $1,662 thousand which is included in “other income” in the consolidated\nstatements of profit or loss.\nEmza is an Israeli company dedicated to the development of visual sensors that include\nproprietary machine-vision algorithms and specific architectures that enable always-on visual\nsensing capabilities, achieving improvement in power consumption, price and form factor. This\nacquisition would allow the Company to fully leverage the synergy into producing visual sensors\nthat integrate camera, hardware and algorithms and operate at unprecedented power, cost and\nsize.\nThe results of Emza’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements since that date. The amounts of Emza’s revenues and losses included in the\nconsolidated statements of profit or loss from the acquisition date to the period ended December\n31, 2018 were $72 thousand and $2,858 thousand, respectively. If the acquisition had occurred\non January 1, 2018, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been $723,605\nthousand (unaudited), and consolidated profit for the year would have been $7,291 thousand\n(unaudited). In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value\nadjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had\noccurred on January 1, 2018.\nThe Company incurred acquisition-related costs of $195 thousand on legal fees and due\ndiligence costs. These costs have been included in “general and administrative expenses” in the\nconsolidated statements of profit or loss.\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of estimated fair value of the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.\nFair value\n(in thousands)\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nCash $ 170\nCurrent assets, other than cash 335\nProperty, plant and equipment 27\nDeferred tax assets 1,445\nOther intangible assets 8,545\nOther current liabilities (2,706)\nDeferred tax liabilities (1,445)\nTotal identifiable net assets acquired $ 6,371\nF-32\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

The valuation of\nacquired intangible assets consisting of the core and developed technology $6,282 thousand and\ntrademark $1,800 thousand were determined based on management’s estimates and consultation with\nan independent appraiser. The multi-period excess earnings method was used in applying the income\napproach to determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets. Significant assumptions inherent\nin the valuation method for acquired intangible assets are employed and included, but are not limited\nto, prospective financial information, terminal value, and discount rates. When performing the multi-\nperiod excess earnings method for acquired intangible assets, the Company incorporates the use of\nprojected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based\nassumptions. The cash-flow projections are based on seven-year financial forecasts developed by\nmanagement that include revenue projections, capital spending trends, and investment in working\ncapital to support anticipated revenue growth, which are regularly reviewed by management. The\nselected discount rate considers the risk and nature of the comparative companies and the rates of\nreturn market participants would require to investing their capital in reporting units.\nThe acquired intangible assets, the core and developed technology, will be amortized based on a\nweighted-average useful life of approximately 7 years. However, the acquired trademark is intangible\nasset with an indefinite useful life.\nNote 6.

I nterest rate risk\nThe Company’s unsecured borrowings and secured borrowings carried floating interest rates\nand fixed interest rates. The Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates is mainly from\nfloating-rate borrowings. Any change in interest rates will cause the effective interest rates of\nborrowings to change and thus cause the future cash flows to fluctuate over time.\nThe following sensitivity analysis is determined based on the exposure to interest rate risk.\nFor floating-rate debts, the analysis assumes that the balances of outstanding debts at the end\nof the reporting period had been outstanding for the entire year.\nFor the Company’s floating-rate debts, assuming all other variables were remained constant,\nan increase or a decrease in the interest rate by 0.25% would have resulted in a decrease or\nan increase in the net profit before tax for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 by\n$243 thousand and $336 thousand, respectively.\n(d) Fair value information\ni.

The fair\nvalue using valuation techniques refers to the current fair value of other financial\ninstruments with similar conditions and characteristics, or using a discounted cash flow\nmethod, or other valuation techniques which include model calculating with observable\nmarket data at the reporting date.\nThe fair value of equity securities-unlisted company is determined by reference to\nmarket valuations for similar operating entities quoted in an active market based on the\nnet assets value of investees.

Financial Risk Management\n(a) Overviews\nThe Company is exposed to the following risks due to usage of financial instruments:\n(1) Credit risk\n(2) Liquidity risk\n(3) Market risk\nHereinafter discloses information about the Company’s exposure to variable risks, and the goals,\npolicies and procedures of the Company’s risk measurement and risk management.\n(b) Risk management framework\nManagement of related divisions are appointed to review, control, trace and monitor the strategic\nrisks, financial risks and operational risks faced by the Company. Management reports to\nexecutive officers the progress of risk controls from time to time and, if necessary, report to the\nboard of directors, depending on the extent of impact of risks.\n(c) Credit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial\ninstrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company’s exposures to credit risk\nare primarily from cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost and accounts\nreceivable.\nThe Company deposits its cash and cash equivalents with various reputable financial institutions.\nFinancial assets at amortized cost are time deposits with original maturities of greater than three\nmonths. The Company has not experienced any material losses on deposits of the Company’s\ncash and cash equivalents and financial assets at amortized cost. Management performs\nperiodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the\namount of credit exposure with any one institution. Management believes that there is a limited\nconcentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalent and financial assets at amortized cost.\nThe Company derived substantially all of its revenues from sales of display drivers that are\nincorporated into TFT-LCD panels. The TFT-LCD panel industry is intensely competitive\nand is vulnerable to cyclical market conditions and subject to price fluctuations. Management\ncontinuously evaluates and controls the credit quality, credit limit and financial strength of its\ncustomers to ensure any overdue receivables are taken necessary procedures.\nThe Company depends on two customers for majority of its revenues. The Company’s sales to\nthese two customers as a percentage of revenues are as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2017 2018 2019\nCustomer A and its affiliates 25.8% 28.1% 29.5%\nCustomer B and its affiliates 15.5% 12.6% 8.9%\nF-64\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\nThe percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable accounted by customers, those representing\nmore than 10% of total accounts receivable balance, is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2018 2019\nCustomer A and its affiliates 33.5% 37.7%\nCustomer B and its affiliates 12.9% 7.9%\nRefer to Note 11 for aging analysis of accounts receivable and the movement in the loss\nallowance.\nIn addition, the Company has at times agreed to extend the payment terms for certain of its\ncustomers. Other customers have also requested extension of payment terms, and the Company\nmay grant such requests for extension in the future. As a result, a default by any such customer, a\nprolonged delay in the payment of accounts receivable, or the extension of payment terms for the\nCompany’s customers could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow, liquidity and operating\nresults. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of each customer and adjusts credit\npolicy based upon payment history and the customer’s credit worthiness, as determined by the\nreview of their current credit information.\n(d) Liquidity risk\nThe objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to\nfund its business requirements associated with existing operations over the next 12 months. The\nCompany manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate working capital and unused credit\nfacilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company’s working capital together with existing unused credit\nfacilities under its existing loan agreements will be sufficient to fulfill all of its contractual\nobligations. Therefore, management believes that there is no liquidity risk resulting from\nincapable of financing to fulfill the contractual obligations.\n(e) Market risk\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest\nrates, will affect the Company’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The\nobjective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within\nacceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n(1) Currency risk\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on operating activities that are denominated in\na currency other than the respective functional currency of the Company, the USD. The\ncurrencies used in these transactions are the NTD and CNY.\nF-65\nHIMAX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019\n(2) Interest rate risk\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to its outstanding borrowings.\nThe Company’s borrowings carried floating interest rates. To manage the interest rate risk,\nthe Company periodically assesses the interest rates of bank loans and maintains good\nrelationships with financial institutions to obtain lower financing costs. The Company also\nstrengthens the management of working capital to reduce the dependence on bank loans as\nwell as the risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\nNote 24. Capital management\nThrough clear understanding and managing of significant changes in external environment, related\nindustry characteristics, and corporate growth plan, the Company manages its capital structure\nin a manner to ensure it has sufficient financial resources to fund its working capital needs,\ncapital expenditures, research and development activities, dividend payments and other business\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\nThere were no changes in the Company’s approach to capital management during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.

Subsequent Event\nHistorically, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, the first quarter has seasonally been the slowest\nperiod of the year in terms of sales, often down by more than 10% sequentially. At this time,\nhowever, based on Himax’s current pipeline, the Company is experiencing decent sales in the first\nquarter, brushing aside the seasonal factor. However, the coronavirus outbreak currently taking place\nin China and all over the world does represent a major uncertainty to Himax’s operations, especially\nfor the short term. The Company is working extremely close with both the customers and suppliers in\nits joint efforts to mitigate the risks. The first quarter guidance provided during the Company’s fourth\nquarter earnings call on February 13, 2020 already included the anticipated impact to the business\nfrom the coronavirus outbreak which reflects some downward adjustments mainly from certain\nChina-based customers for small-sized display drivers and CMOS image sensors. With vast majority\nof operations located outside of China, the Company’s suppliers are largely unaffected by the\ncoronavirus outbreak. The focus there is primarily the logistics management including the customs\noperations in various ports in China.\nThe situation is still evolving. Notwithstanding the uncertainty arisen from the coronavirus, the\nCompany is confident that it will see decent growth across the board for all its major product\ncategories in 2020."
