The following key findings are highlighted in the accepted manuscript:\n\n  * **First Demonstration of Safety:** This is the first known study to demonstrate the safety of adoptive immunotherapy with allogeneic, off-the-shelf NK cells in patients with active COVID-19, especially those at high risk for disease progression.\n  * **Innovative NK Cell Therapy:** DVX201 is the first allogeneic NK cell adoptive immunotherapy used clinically that is derived from pooled donor cord blood CD34+ cells, offering a scalable, consistent, and cost-effective solution to barriers in the allogeneic cell therapy space.\n  * **No Adverse Events:** DVX201 infusions were safe and well-tolerated, with no treatment-related adverse events, including no cytokine release syndrome (CRS).\n  * **Study Observations:** Observations included rapid improvements in oxygenation, improved pulmonary radiographic findings, and hospital discharge within days of infusion.\n  * **Future Potential for Viral Therapies:** This study supports the potential of allogeneic NK cell therapy as a scalable, stockpile-ready antiviral treatment for future viral pandemics.\n\n\n\n_\" Despite advances in treatment and prevention strategies for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 still results in substantial morbidity in certain patient populations underscoring the ongoing need for additional therapeutic options, particularly among immune compromised individuals,\" said Joshua Hill, MD, associate professor and physician at Fred Hutch Cancer Center and corresponding author of the study. \"Although the study was not designed to assess efficacy, our findings demonstrate the safety and potential utility of NK cell therapy as a complementary therapeutic strategy for viral infections in high-risk patients.\"_\n\n\"We are very excited by these results and look forward to sharing the full findings in _Molecular Therapy Methods and Clinical Development,_ \" said Dave Mehalick, President and CEO of Coeptis Therapeutic. \"These positive results, along with our recently announced expanded license agreement with Deverra, further strengthens Coeptis' role in the fight against infectious diseases.\"\n\nTo access the full publication in _Molecular Therapy Methods and Clinical Development_ , please visit: [https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/methods/fulltext/S2329-0501(24)00177-3](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4294642-1&h=2439556500&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fmolecular-therapy-family%2Fmethods%2Ffulltext%2FS2329-0501\\(24\\)00177-3&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fmolecular-therapy-family%2Fmethods%2Ffulltext%2FS2329-0501\\(24\\)00177-3)\n\n**About Coeptis Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.** Coeptis Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., together with its subsidiaries including Coeptis Therapeutics, Inc. and Coeptis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (collectively \"Coeptis\"), is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cell therapy platforms for cancer, autoimmune, and infectious diseases that have the potential to disrupt conventional treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes.
