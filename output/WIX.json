Since then, we've continued advancing our AI offerings by using a combination of deep learning technologies and Generative AI algorithms like LLMs, including our own proprietary models.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/223a89_2a33d891a6ad4a14bcd1136687595e2e~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_900,h_709,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/234557%201.webp)\n\nWe have built and launched a comprehensive suite of AI and genAI products that helps accelerate user success. As we make it easier for our users to achieve their goals, their satisfaction increases, conversion increases, user retention increases, monetization increases and the value of Wix grows. \n\nIn early 2024, we launched our highly anticipated AI Website Builder to all users globally in a variety of languages – an important milestone in our AI journey. The AI Website Builder represents the first time users can effortlessly harness advanced AI capabilities to fully create their digital presence. With a ready-to-publish website, integrated with relevant business applications with countless more advanced features in production, we're rapidly ushering in a new era of website creation and user success. \n\nToday, AI models power many of our internal processes and user-facing innovations, including: full site creation, text creation, image creation and enhancement, site design, user support, user sentiment analysis, site classification, recommendation engines, semantic search, forecasting, development velocity, and many more.\n\nWe are constantly innovating and leveraging new emerging AI technologies to further reduce friction in the web creation experience, increase the value of our platform and drive efficiencies internally at Wix. With our domain expertise in AI, nearly a decade's head start in building native AI tools and proven success in integrating leading, third party AI tools, Wix is well positioned to continue pioneering new AI tools in the website building industry. \n\n## Learn about Avishai’s thoughts on AI [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abrahamiavishai_wixs-new-adi-tool-uses-artificial-intelligence-activity-7059912914832363520-qhYY/?trk=public_profile_like_view)[. ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abrahamiavishai_wixs-new-adi-tool-uses-artificial-intelligence-activity-7059912914832363520-qhYY/?trk=public_profile_like_view)\n\n## BY THE NUMBERS\n\n2015\n\nWix AI team founded\n\n16B\n\nYearly predictions\n\n200+\n\nAI and genAI models deployed on our platform\n\n~5 Years\n\nOf collaboration with top AI companies (IBM, GoogleX, OpenAI) \n\n## AI TOOLS FOR WIX USERS\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_bf8533f4b76a457cbd41e565a06d3f3f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_116,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/Group%201000001886.jpg)\n\nAI Website Builder\n\nRead more\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_fc824329d63c4ba182d790755196dfc9~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_114,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/-.jpg)\n\nAI inside Wix Studio\n\nRead more\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_0dc61e3bd511453ea9a54e8c391fc700~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_97,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/Group%201000002687.jpg)\n\nAI-powered creation tools\n\nRead more\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_61af08bbb7134aecbf28dd688b10b7f0~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_147,h_116,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/Group%201000001977.jpg)\n\nAI eCommerce capabilities\n\nRead more\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_73dbf64f2b29480cb4b7d5e02e59f634~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_49,h_39,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2,enc_auto/Group%201000001979.png)\n\nAI marketing and advertising tools\n\nRead more\n\nLearn more about Wix’s comprehensive (and growing!) suite of AI tools [here](https://www.wix.com/features/ai) and [here](https://www.wix.com/blog/wix-ai-tools)[.](https://www.wix.com/blog/wix-ai-tools)\n\n  * Reduced human support interaction\n\n    * AI chatbot\n\n    * Article recommendation\n\n    * Knowledge Base search\n\n  * Automatic call summarization\n\n  * Answer suggestion\n\n  * Sentiment analysis\n\n  * Smart routing\n\n\n\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_305199eeb3cc43b0b4bea7698322554a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_584,h_422,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/image%20255.jpg)\n\nCustomer Care\n\n  * Expanded internal machine learning platform (proprietary algorithms and third-party models) resulting in more efficient and faster release of high-quality AI-based features and tools\n\n  * GenAI-based platform dedicated to conversation assistance\n\n    * Complete generic infrastructure paired with in-house agent architecture for conversational assistant products, allowing Wix to develop numerous conversational AI experiences across many products rapidly\n\n\n\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_4713050532c14ce9bdbf7d0755546c8d~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_584,h_422,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/dae631_e01a95d1c4ed4487aeac03ff66d9b68a~mv2.webp)\n\nDevelopment Velocity\n\n  * Spam & fraud detection\n\n  * Payments provider recommendation (underwriting)\n\n  * Merchant code assignment and recommendation\n\n  * Identification of restricted products and services\n\n\n\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_337a4223743b4626911a19a0555fda3f~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_584,h_422,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/9f1392_5d376e13c9e847979b2268cb7f7c8b06~mv2.webp)\n\nSecurity & Payments\n\n  * Revenue\n\n  * Churn\n\n  * Subscription premiums\n\n\n\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b58e39_bc726e0ff7794b9e9f1c47ea9f6e2d38~mv2.webp/v1/fill/w_584,h_422,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/9f1392_90ff42a9869c457998d239b0731a4700~mv2.webp)\n\nForecasting\n\n## To learn more about AI inside Wix, please visit our [2023 Analyst & Investor Day discussion](https://investors.wix.com/_files/ugd/b58e39_ced4aa052417411f94aa482a2ec384aa.pdf)[.](https://investors.wix.com/_files/ugd/b58e39_ced4aa052417411f94aa482a2ec384aa.pdf)\n\n## MAIN WAYS WE DEPLOY AI INTERNALLY\n\n## EMAIL ALERTS\n\n### Sign up to receive Wix IR updates\n\nSelect the updates you would like to receive\n\nThanks for submitting!\n\nEmail\n\nApply\n\nFinancial Reports\n\nSEC Filings\n\nPress Releases\n\nEvents\n\n[](https://investors.wix.com/ai)\n\nSign up for email alerts\n\nbottom of page\n"

revised comparative historical numbers for Partners in order to more accurately reflect users we have identified as Partners\nPartners revenue is defined as revenue generated through agencies and freelancers that build sites or applications for other users (“Agencies”) as well as revenue generated through B2B partnerships, such as LegalZoom or Vistaprint (“Resellers”). We identify Agencies\nusing multiple criteria, including but not limited to, the number of sites built, participation in the WixPartner Program and/or the WixMarketplace or Wixproducts used (incl. WixStudio). Partners revenue includes revenue from both the Creative Subscriptions and\nBusiness Solutions businesses.\n* In Q1 2024, the definition was slightly revised to exclude revenue generated from agreements with enterprise users that by their nature are more suitable to be categorized under revenue generated by Self Creators. Such revision had an immaterial impact on prior period\namounts which remain unchanged in the above chart.\nCompany Overview | ThirdQuarter 2024 28"

Such forward-looking statements may\ninclude projections regarding our future performance, including, but not limited to environmental, social and governance goals, targets and projections, and may be identified by words like “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “aim,” “forecast,”\n“indication,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “outlook,” “future,” “will,” “seek” and similar terms or phrases. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are based\non management’s current expectations, which are subject to uncertainty, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Important factors that could cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 22, 2024. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date hereof. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from\ntime to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\n\nAdditionally, while the information discussed in this report may be significant, such significance should not be interpreted as these topics necessarily being material under federal securities laws and regulations, even if we use the words\n“material” or “materiality” in relation to them. Much of the information in this report is informed by various standards and frameworks (including standards for the measurement of underlying data) and the interests of various stakeholders,\nwhich may be more expensive than certain legal requirements. Furthermore, much of this information is subject to assumptions, estimates, third-party information or methodologies that are still evolving and subject to change. While we\nare not aware of any material flaws with the information we have used, except to the extent disclosed, we have not undertaken to independently verify this information or the assumptions or other methodological aspects underlying such\ninformation.\n\nOur disclosures may change due to revisions in framework requirements or recommendations, availability or quality of information, changes in our portfolio composition, changes in our business or the business of our portfolio companies\nor any applicable government policies, changing stakeholder (including investor) focus, or other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. Any such changes may also impact our ability to achieve any ESG-related plans, targets or\ngoals we set, either on the timelines and costs initially anticipated or at all. Moreover, given the uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions involved, the materiality of some of this information, as well as our ability to meet our plans, targets,\ngoals, or other evolving expectations, is inherently difficult to assess far in advance.\n\nFor more information on our performance and activities in these areas, please contact us at wix_esg@wix.com.\nFinally, website and document references throughout this report are provided for convenience only, and the content on the referenced websites or documents is not incorporated by reference into this document."
