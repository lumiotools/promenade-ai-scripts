(Nasdaq: INBX) (\"Inhibrx Biosciences\" or the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Following the completion of the sale of INBRX-101 by Inhibrx, Inc. (the \"Former Parent\") to Sanofi S.A. and the Former Parent's concurrent spin-off of the Inhibrx Biosciences business in May 2024, the biopharmaceutical company now has two programs in ongoing clinical trials, with data readouts for each expected within the next 12 months. Because the spin-off was accounted for as a reverse spin-off, for periods prior to the spin-off, the Company's financial statements are the historical financial statements of the Former Parent.\n\n[ ![Inhibrx, Inc. logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Inhibrx, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1063194/inhibrx_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1063194/inhibrx_Logo.html)\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * **_Cash and Cash Equivalents_** _._ As of September 30, 2024, Inhibrx Biosciences had cash and cash equivalents of $196.3 million, compared to $226.9 million as of June 30, 2024. Cash outflows in the period primarily consisted of payments for its ongoing operations, including payments made to its third party contract development and manufacturing organizations (\"CDMOs\") and contract research organizations (\"CROs\") in support of the Company's ongoing clinical trials.\n  * **_R &D Expense_** _._ Research and development expenses were $38.9 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $38.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to:\n    * an increase in clinical trial expenses due to the expansion of the Company's ongoing registration-enabling Phase 2 trial for ozekibart (INBRX-109) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma. Clinical trial expenses also increased as a result of the expansion of the INBRX-106 Phase 1/2 trial and the initiation of the Phase 2/3 trial in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, including expenses for in-house clinical trial support;\n    * offset in part by a decrease in stock option expense as a result of fewer stock options outstanding in the current period under the Company's new 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the \"2024 Plan\") following the termination of its prior plan in connection with the spin-off.\n  * **_G &A Expense_**. General and administrative expenses were $7.9 million during each of the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The composition of general and administrative expenses fluctuated due to:\n    * a decrease in stock option expense as a result of fewer stock options outstanding in the current period under the 2024 Plan following the termination of its prior plan in connection with the spin-off;\n    * offset by an increase in professional service expenses related to legal and accounting services to support general corporate and intellectual property matters as well as legal proceedings.\n  * **_Other Income (Expense)._** Other income was $2.9 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to other expense of $6.0 million during the third quarter of 2023. Following the Company's spin-off transaction in the second quarter of 2024, the Company no longer has any outstanding third-party debt, and therefore did not incur any interest expense during the period. Other income consists of interest earned on the Company's sweep and money market account balances.\n  * **_Net Loss._** Net loss was $43.9 million during the third quarter of 2024, or $2.84 per share, basic and diluted, compared to a net loss of $51.8 million during the third quarter of 2023, or $4.39 per share, basic and diluted.\n\n\n\n**About Inhibrx Biosciences, Inc.**\n\nInhibrx Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates. Inhibrx Biosciences utilizes diverse methods of protein engineering to address the specific requirements of complex target and disease biology, including its proprietary protein engineering platforms. Inhibrx Biosciences was incorporated in January 2024 as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Inhibrx, Inc. Prior to the sale of Inhibrx, Inc. and the INBRX-101 program to Sanofi S.A., Inhibrx Biosciences acquired certain corporate infrastructure and other assets and liabilities through a series of internal restructuring transactions effected by Inhibrx, Inc. Inhibrx, Inc. also completed a distribution to holders of its shares of common stock of 92% of the issued and outstanding shares of Inhibrx Biosciences. Following such transactions, Inhibrx Biosciences' current clinical pipeline of therapeutic candidates includes ozekibart (INBRX-109) and INBRX-106, both of which utilize multivalent formats where the precise valency can be optimized in a target-centric way to mediate what we believe to be the most appropriate agonist function.

(Nasdaq: INBX) (\"Inhibrx\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company with two programs in ongoing clinical trials and a strong emerging pipeline, is pleased to announce a decisive legal victory in a trade secrets case brought by I-Mab Biopharma (\"I-Mab\") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The jury found in favor of Inhibrx, rejecting **__all__** allegations of misappropriation before it, confirming the Company's adherence to high ethical standards and innovation in scientific research.\n\n[ ![Inhibrx, Inc. logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Inhibrx, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1063194/inhibrx_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1063194/inhibrx_Logo.html)\n\nI-Mab had initiated the lawsuit on March 1, 2022, alleging that Inhibrx and its Chief Scientific Officer, Brendan Eckelman, Ph.D., improperly accessed and used proprietary information related to several of I-Mab's research projects during a prior arbitration proceeding involving I-Mab, for which Dr. Eckelman served as an expert witness. However, the jury found absolutely no basis for these claims, validating Inhibrx's independent development processes and principled conduct in advancing its therapeutic innovations.\n\n\"Inhibrx was founded on the values of integrity, scientific excellence, and a commitment to advancing novel therapeutics for patients in need. This verdict is not only vindicating, disproving unfounded allegations, but also reaffirms our dedication to conducting groundbreaking research with the utmost respect for ethical boundaries,\" said Dr. Eckelman. \"We're proud of the work we do and of the team that made this possible by upholding the highest standards.\"\n\nThroughout the trial, Inhibrx demonstrated that its scientific achievements were the result of its own hard work, advanced capabilities, and innovation. Testimonies from Inhibrx's scientists highlighted the Company's deep commitment to independent development, securing proprietary knowledge, and protecting intellectual property.\n\nInhibrx began as a small startup with a mission to pioneer treatments that offer hope to patients battling cancer and other serious diseases. Today, as a publicly traded company with a growing portfolio of therapeutic candidates, it remains dedicated to advancing solutions for unmet medical needs while respecting the intellectual property of others.\n\n\"This outcome allows us to focus even more on what matters: delivering life-changing therapies to patients around the world,\" added Mark Lappe, CEO of Inhibrx. \"We are grateful for the support we received throughout this process and for the opportunity to continue our work undistracted and with renewed dedication.\"\n\nInhibrx was represented by Potter Anderson & Corroon LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati PC. Certain matters remain before the Court.\n\n**About Inhibrx** Inhibrx is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates in oncology.

(the \"Former Parent\") announced its intent, as approved by its board of directors, to effect the spin-off of INBRX-101, an optimized, recombinant alpha-1 antitrypsin (\"AAT\"), augmentation therapy currently in a registrational trial for the treatment of patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n  * On May 30, 2024, the Former Parent completed the transaction, pursuant to which (i) all assets and liabilities primarily related to INBRX-101 (the \"101 Business\"), were transferred to Aventis Inc. (the \"Acquirer\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. (\"Sanofi\"); and (ii) by way of a pre-closing reorganization (the \"Separation\"), the Company acquired the assets and liabilities and corporate infrastructure associated with its ongoing programs, INBRX-106 and ozekibart (INBRX-109), and its discovery pipeline, as well as the remaining close-out obligations related to its previously terminated program, INBRX-105.\n  * Upon the closing, each Former Parent stockholder received: (i) $30.00 per share in cash, (ii) one contingent value right per share, representing the right to receive a contingent payment of $5.00 in cash upon the achievement of a regulatory milestone, and (iii) one SEC-registered, publicly listed, share of Inhibrx Biosciences for every four shares of the Former Parent's common stock held. The Former Parent retained an equity interest in Inhibrx Biosciences of 8% upon the distribution of shares to the Former Parent stockholders (the \"Distribution\").\n  * In connection with the Separation, the Acquirer paid transaction consideration totaling approximately $2.2 billion in aggregate value, including the $35.00 per share consideration and the assumption of the third-party debt obligations of the Former Parent. In addition, the Acquirer assumed all assets and liabilities under contracts primarily related to INBRX-101 upon close of the transaction. The Acquirer also reimbursed the Company or paid on behalf of the Company $68.0 million in transaction costs.\n  * From and after the closing, Inhibrx Biosciences continues to operate as a stand-alone, publicly traded company focused on its two clinical programs, ozekibart (INBRX-109) and INBRX-106. Inhibrx Biosciences continues to trade as INBX on the Nasdaq Global Market. We do not expect the results of operations directly arising from and related to the Separation and Distribution to occur in future periods.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\n  * **_Cash and Cash Equivalents_** _._ As of June 30, 2024, Inhibrx Biosciences had cash and cash equivalents of $226.9 million, compared to $255.4 million as of May 30, 2024 following the Separation from the Former Parent. The Company's cash outflows during this period relate primarily to the distribution of consideration totaling $17.7 million, which was paid out to the Former Parent's optionholders and remitted by the Company within ten business days of the close of the transaction in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution. Other cash outflows during the period relate to the Company's ongoing operations.\n  * **_R &D Expense_** _._ Research and development expenses were $67.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $34.1 million during the second quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the following factors:\n    * stock option expense recognized upon the acceleration of outstanding stock options in connection with the Separation and Distribution;\n    * an increase in CMC expenses due to the nature of the development and manufacturing activities performed at its CDMO and CRO partners supporting the Company's clinical and preclinical therapeutic candidates, which reflect the stage-specific needs of its programs during each period, including early and late-stage drug substance clinical manufacturing, analytical development, quality control, testing and stability studies, drug product development, scale-up, robustness studies, and selected biologics license applications-enabling activities; and\n    * offset in part by a decrease in clinical trial expenses following the termination of the Company's INBRX-105 program and the removal of the INBRX-101 program following the Separation.\n  * **_G &A Expense_**. General and administrative expenses were $93.4 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to $7.3 million during the second quarter of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following factors:\n    * an increase in legal, advisory, and consulting fees incurred in connection with the Separation and Distribution;\n    * stock option expense recognized upon the acceleration of outstanding stock options in connection with the Separation and Distribution;\n    * an increase in pre-commercialization expenses, which was primarily related to increases in consulting services to support the Company's commercial operations business intelligence strategies and market research expenses related to ozekibart (INBRX-109) and INBRX-101 prior to the transaction;\n    * an increase in professional service expenses related to legal services which support the Company in its general corporate and intellectual property matters, and legal proceedings.\n  * **_Other Income (Expense)._** Other income was $2.0 billion during the second quarter of 2024, compared to other expense of $5.7 million during the second quarter of 2023. Other income during the second quarter of 2024 consists of gains recorded in connection with the completion of the Separation and Distribution, related to (i) the consideration paid by the Acquirer for all outstanding common stock, warrants, and stock options, (ii) the extinguishment of the Company's outstanding debt which was assumed by the Acquirer, (iii) assets and liabilities related to the 101 Business, which were assumed by the Acquirer, and (iv) transaction costs paid for by the Acquirer.\n  * **_Net Income (Loss)._** Net income was $1.9 billion during the second quarter of 2024, or earnings per share of $127.10, basic, and $125.48, diluted, compared to a net loss of $47.1 million during the second quarter of 2023, or $4.31 per share, basic and diluted.\n\n\n\n**About Inhibrx Biosciences, Inc.**\n\nInhibrx Biosciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad pipeline of novel biologic therapeutic candidates in oncology.
