(the “Extension Amendment”) be\nadopted which reflects the extension of the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination\n(the “Combination Period”) from December 22, 2023 (the “Termination Date”) up to ten(10) times, the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each (each an “Extension”)\nup to December 22, 2024 (i.e., for a period of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its initial public\noffering (the “IPO”)) for a total of twelve (12) months after the Termination Date (assuming a Business Combination\n(as defined below) has not occurred). The end date of each Extension shall be referred to herein as the “Extended\nDate.”\nProposal No. 2 - Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal — To resolve that AlphaVest’s investment management trust\nagreement, dated as of December 19, 2022, (as amended, the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), be amended to allow the Company to extend the\nTermination Date from December 22, 2023 up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months,\nand the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each up to December 22, 2024 (the “Trust Agreement\nAmendment”) by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or\nExtended Date, as applicable and depositing into the trust account (the “Trust Account”), $55,000 for each month in\nan Extension (the “Extension Payment”) pursuant to an amendment to the Trust Agreement in the form set forth in\nAnnex B of the Proxy Statement (the “Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal”).\nProposal No. 3—Adjournment Proposal— To approve as an ordinary resolution that the chairman of the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting be directed to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Extraordinary General\nMeeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal or to provide additional time to effectuate the Extension, the Extension Amendment and Trust\nAgreement Amendment.\nEach of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment\nProposal is more fully described in the Proxy Statement. Please take the time to read carefully each of the proposals\nin the Proxy Statement before you vote. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement\nAmendment and Extension. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares\nin an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived\nby the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to\nhold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may\nliquidate on the Termination Date.\nThe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and, if necessary,\nthe Adjournment Proposal, is to allow AlphaVest additional and flexibility to complete our previously announced\nBusiness Combination. On August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination agreement with AV\nMerger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger\nSub”), and Wanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Wanshun”).\nHowever, there can be no guarantee the business combination with Merger Sub and Wanshun will be consummated.\nIf it is not consummated, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and, if\nnecessary, the Adjournment Proposal, will allow AlphaVest additional time to complete an initial business\ncombination (a “Business Combination”). Additionally, the purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal is to\nsimultaneously (i) provide those AlphaVest shareholders who do not wish to extend the Termination Date with the\nopportunity to exercise their redemption rights earlier than they would if AlphaVest liquidated on the Termination\nDate and (ii) allow those AlphaVest shareholders who wish for AlphaVest to continue its search for a Business\nCombination to remain shareholders. Currently, the Company has until the Termination Date, or December 22, 2023,\nto consummate a Business Combination. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of AlphaVest to seek\nan extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to allow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination.\nThe Board believes that the current Termination Date will not provide sufficient time to complete a Business\nCombination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to identifying\na Business Combination target, circumstances warrant providing shareholders with additional time and opportunity to\nconsider a prospective Business Combination. However, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and\nExtension are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination\nwithin the Combination Period, as extended, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business\nCombination.\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and the Trust Agreement, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of\nour sponsor, AlphaVest Holding LP (the “Sponsor”), avail ourselves of the two (2) additional three-month extension\nperiods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’\nadvance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such\nthree-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10\nper share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, we may, by resolution of the Board,\nat the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension comprised of three\nmonths, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each to consummate the Business\nCombination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior\nto the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that\nour Sponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business Combination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit\nthe Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the Sponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory\nnote equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event that we are unable\nto close a Business Combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that\nwe receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline of its wish for us\nto effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such Extension at least three days prior to the\napplicable Business Combination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its\naffiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our Business\nCombination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees, decide to extend the period\nof time to consummate our Business Combination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required.\nIf we are unable to consummate our Business Combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible\nbut not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.0001\nper share (the “Ordinary Shares”) which were issued in the Company’s initial public offering (the “Public Shares”)\nfor a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the\nfunds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interests to\npay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such\namounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the\nevent of our dissolution and liquidation, the rights will expire and be worthless.\nAs contemplated by the Existing Charter, in the event that any amendment is made to the Existing Charter to,\namong other things, modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemptions in connection\nwith a Business Combination, the holders of Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) may elect to redeem their\nPublic Shares upon the approval of any such amendment to the Existing Charter in exchange for a pro rata share of\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account (net of\ntaxes paid or payable, if any), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares (the “Redemption”). You may\nelect to redeem your Public Shares in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, regardless of whether you\nvote for or against the proposals, by following the instructions set forth in the accompanying Proxy Statement. In\naddition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause\nour net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate\nof such Public Shareholder or any other person with whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group”\n(as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be\nrestricted from redeeming its Public Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares,\nwithout the Company’s prior consent. Accordingly, if a Public Shareholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group,\nseeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such shares in excess of that 15% limit would not be\nredeemed for cash.\nOn the Record Date (defined below), the redemption price per Public Share was approximately $10.68 (which is\nexpected to be the same approximate price per Public Share on the date of the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of approximately $73,731,029.06\nas of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to AlphaVest to pay its taxes), divided by the total\nnumber of then outstanding Public Shares. The closing price of the Public Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market\n(“Nasdaq”) on the Record Date was $10.69. Accordingly, if the market price of the Public Shares were to remain the\nsame until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a holder of\nPublic Shares receiving approximately $0.01 less per share than if the Public Shares were sold in the open market.\nAlphaVest cannot assure Public Shareholders that they will be able to sell their Public Shares in the open market, even\nif the market price per Public Share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient\nliquidity in its securities when such Public Shareholders wish to sell their Public Shares. AlphaVest believes that such\nredemption right enables its holders of Public Shares to determine whether to sustain their investments for an\nadditional period if AlphaVest does not complete a Business Combination on or before the Termination Date.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business\nCombination is not consummated by the Termination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest\nshareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as\nreasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price,\npayable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the\nfunds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to\npay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will\ncompletely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating\ndistributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption,\nsubject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to\nour obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable\nlaw.\nPursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder may request to redeem all or a portion of such holder’s\nPublic Shares for cash if the Extension Amendment is consummated. As a holder of Public Shares, you will be entitled\nto receive cash for any Public Shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold Public Shares or (b) hold Public Shares through Units (as defined below) and elect to separate your\nUnits into the underlying Public Shares and Public Rights (as defined below) prior to exercising your\nredemption rights with respect to the Public Shares;\n(ii) submit a written request to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee” or “transfer agent”)\nincluding the legal name, phone number and address of the beneficial owner of the Public Shares for which\nredemption is requested, that AlphaVest redeem all or a portion of your Public Shares for cash; and\n(iii) deliver your share certificates for Public Shares (if any) along with other applicable redemption forms to the\nTrustee, physically or electronically through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\nHolders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Shares in the manner described above\nprior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 18, 2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting) in order for their Public Shares to be redeemed. Public Shareholders may elect to\nredeem Public Shares regardless of if or how they vote in respect of the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the\nExtension Amendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension are not consummated, the Public Shares will be\nreturned to the respective holder, broker or bank.\nSubject to the foregoing, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under\nCayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding\nOrdinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting, or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has\n9,180,500 Ordinary Shares outstanding. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Ordinary Shares held by the Sponsor and the representative of\nour underwriters in our initial public offering (the “Founder Shares”), the Company will need 3,839,834 Public Shares,\nor 55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal to approve such\nproposal.\nApproval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent\n(65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Trust Agreement. If all outstanding Ordinary Shares\nare present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Founder Shares, the Company will need\n3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal\nto approve such proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a simple majority of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and\nwho, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or any adjournment\nthereof, vote on such matter. All outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then\nin addition to the Founder Shares, the Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares to vote\nin favor of the Adjournment Proposal to approve such proposal. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for\na vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nRecord holders of Ordinary Shares at the close of business on December 7, 2023 (the “Record Date”) are entitled\nto vote or have their votes cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 6,900,000 issued\nand outstanding Public Shares and 2,280,500 issued and outstanding Founder Shares. AlphaVest’s rights do not have\nvoting rights.\nThis Proxy Statement contains important information about the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Extension\nAmendment Proposal the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not you\nplan to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting, virtually or in person, AlphaVest urges you to read this material\ncarefully and vote your shares.\nThis Proxy Statement is dated December 7, 2023 and is first being mailed to shareholders on or about that date.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of AlphaVest Acquisition Corp\nYong (David) Yan\nChief Executive Officer"

The\nExtraordinary General Meeting will be held in person at the offices of Winston & Strawn LLP located at 800 Capitol St., Suite 2400, Houston, Texas 77002, and\nvirtually via live webcast at https://www.cstproxy.com/alphavest/2023 and via teleconference using the following dial-in information:\nTelephone access (listen-only):\nWithin the U.S. and Canada: 1 800-450-7155 (toll-free)\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada: 1 857-999-9155 (standard rates apply)\nConference ID: 4031986#\nThe attached Notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting and accompanying Proxy Statement (the “Proxy Statement”) describe the business AlphaVest will\nconduct at the Extraordinary General Meeting and provide information about AlphaVest that you should consider when you vote your shares. As set forth in the\nattached Proxy Statement, the Extraordinary General Meeting will be held for the purpose of considering and voting on the following proposals:\nProposal No. 1—Extension Amendment Proposal—A proposal, by special resolution, to amend AlphaVest’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation, dated as of December 19, 2022 (the “Existing Charter”) by adopting the AlphaVest’s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation in the form set forth in Annex A to the Proxy Statement (the “Extension Amendment”) which reflects the extension of the date by which the Company\nmust consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) up to ten (10) times from December 22, 2023 (the “Termination Date”) to December 22,\n2024, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each (each, an “Extension”) (i.e., for a\nperiod of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its initial public offering (the “IPO”)) for a total of twelve (12) months after the Termination Date\n(assuming a Business Combination (as defined below) has not occurred). The end date of each Extension shall be referred to herein as the “Extended Date.” We refer\nto this proposal as the “Extension Amendment Proposal”;\nProposal No. 2 - Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal — A proposal, by at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares, to amend\nAlphaVest’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 19, 2022, (as amended, the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and\nContinental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date or Extended Date, as applicable, to\nDecember 22, 2024 (the “Trust Agreement Amendment”) by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended\nDate and depositing into the trust account (the “Trust Account”) $55,000 for each month in an Extension the “Extension Payment”) until December 22, 2024\n(assuming a Business Combination has not occurred) in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon the consummation of a\nBusiness Combination (the “Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal”); and\nProposal No. 3—Adjournment Proposal—A proposal, by ordinary resolution to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting, there are not sufficient votes to\napprove the Extension Amendment Proposal and Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or to provide additional time to effectuate the Extension Amendment, Trust\nAgreement Amendment and Extension (the “Adjournment Proposal”).\nEach of the Extension Amendment Proposal, Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the Proxy\nStatement. Please take the time to read carefully each of the proposals in the Proxy Statement before you vote. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and\nTrust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension. In addition,\npursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares (as defined below) in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than\n$5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension\nAmendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nThe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow AlphaVest\nadditional time and flexibility to complete our previously announced Business Combination. On August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination\nagreement with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Wanshun\nTechnology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Wanshun”). However, there can be no guarantee the business combination with\nMerger Sub and Wanshun will be consummated. If it is not consummated, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and, if\nnecessary, the Adjournment Proposal, will allow AlphaVest additional time to complete an initial business combination (a “Business Combination”). Additionally,\nthe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal is to simultaneously (i) provide those AlphaVest shareholders who do not wish to extend the Termination Date\nwith the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights earlier than they would if AlphaVest liquidated on the Termination Date and (ii) allow those AlphaVest\nshareholders who wish for AlphaVest to continue its search for a Business Combination to remain shareholders.\nCurrently, the Company has until the Termination Date, or December 22, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Board has determined that it is in\nthe best interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the\nTrust Agreement Amendment Proposal to allow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination Date\nwill not provide sufficient time to complete a Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to\nidentifying a Business Combination target, circumstances warrant providing shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective Business\nCombination. However, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal and Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved and the Extension Amendment, Trust\nAgreement Amendment and Extension are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination within the\nCombination Period, as extended, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and the Trust Agreement, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our sponsor, AlphaVest Holding LP (the\n“Sponsor”), avail ourselves of the two (2) additional three-month extension periods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates\nor designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month\nextension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment\nProposal is approved, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or\nits affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such\nthree-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline the $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that our\nSponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business Combination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the\nSponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event\nthat we are unable to close a Business Combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our\nSponsor five days prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such\nExtension at least three days prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund\nthe Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees,\ndecide to extend the period of time to consummate our Business Combination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable\nto consummate our Business Combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, outstanding\nordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Shares”) which were issued in the Company’s initial public offering (the “Public Shares”) for a pro rata\nportion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released\nto us to pay our taxes if any (less up to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to\ndistribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and\nliquidation, the rights will expire and be worthless.\nAs contemplated by the Existing Charter, in the event that any amendment is made to the Existing Charter to, among other things, modify the substance or\ntiming of the Company’s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) may\nelect to redeem their Public Shares upon the approval of any such amendment to the Existing Charter in exchange for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then\non deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account (net of taxes paid or payable, if any), divided by the number of then outstanding\nPublic Shares (the “Redemption”). You may elect to redeem your Public Shares in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, regardless of whether you\nvote for or against the proposals, by following the instructions set forth in the accompanying Proxy Statement. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter,\nAlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by\nthe Board.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person\nwith whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its Public Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the Company’s\nprior consent. Accordingly, if a Public Shareholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such\nshares in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for cash.\nOn the Record Date (defined below), the redemption price per Public Share was approximately $10.68 (which is expected to be the same approximate price per\nPublic Share on the date of the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of\napproximately $73,731,029.06 as of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to AlphaVest to pay its taxes), divided by the total number of then\noutstanding Public Shares. The closing price of the Public Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) on the Record Date was $10.69. Accordingly, if the\nmarket price of the Public Shares were to remain the same until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a holder\nof Public Shares receiving approximately $0.01 less per share than if the Public Shares were sold in the open market. AlphaVest cannot assure Public Shareholders\nthat they will be able to sell their Public Shares in the open market, even if the market price per Public Share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there\nmay not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such Public Shareholders wish to sell their Public Shares. AlphaVest believes that such redemption right enables\nits holders of Public Shares to determine whether to sustain their investments for an additional period if AlphaVest does not complete a Business Combination on or\nbefore the Termination Date.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the\nTermination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay\nour taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely\nextinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in\neach case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nSubject to the foregoing, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote\nof the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at\nthe Extraordinary General Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has 9,180,500 Ordinary\nShares outstanding. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Ordinary Shares held by\nthe Sponsor and the representative of our underwriters in our initial public offering (the “Founder Shares”), the Company will need 3,839,834 Public Shares, or\n55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nApproval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares\npursuant to the Trust Agreement. If all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Founder Shares, the\nCompany will need 3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of a simple majority\nof the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or any\nadjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Assuming all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the\nFounder Shares, the Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares to vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nThe Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nThe Board has fixed the close of business on December 7, 2023 (the “Record Date”) as the date for determining AlphaVest shareholders entitled to receive\nnotice of and vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of Ordinary Shares on the Record Date are entitled to\nhave their votes counted at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof. On the Record Date, there were 6,900,000 issued and outstanding Public\nShares and 2,280,500 issued and outstanding Founder Shares. AlphaVest’s rights do not have voting rights.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a Business Combination at this time. If the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are\nimplemented and you do not elect to redeem all your Public Shares, you will retain the right to vote on any such Business Combination when and if it is\nsubmitted to shareholders (provided that you are a shareholder on the applicable record date) and the right to redeem your remaining Public Shares for\ncash in the event a Business Combination is approved and completed or in the event we have not consummated a Business Combination by the last\nExtended Date, December 22, 2024. There is no guarantee that we will identify a suitable target and, even if we do identify one, that we will be able to\ncomplete a Business Combination before the expiration of the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024.\nAfter careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal\nand the Adjournment Proposal (if required) are in the best interests of AlphaVest and its shareholders, and has declared it advisable and recommends that you vote or\ngive instruction to vote “FOR” such proposals.\nAlphaVest’s Sponsor, directors and officers have interests in the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests include, among others, ownership, directly or\nindirectly of Founder Shares and units consisting of Ordinary Shares and rights sold to the Sponsor in a private placement that may become exercisable in the future.\nSee the section entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of AlphaVest—Interests of the Initial Shareholders” in the accompanying Proxy Statement.\nEnclosed is the Proxy Statement containing detailed information about the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not you plan to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting, AlphaVest urges you to read\nthis material carefully and vote your shares. You may do so by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy promptly, or following the instructions contained in\nthe proxy card or voting instructions. If you grant a proxy, you may revoke it at any time prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting or vote in person or online at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct your broker or bank how to vote your shares, or\nyou may cast your vote online at the Extraordinary General Meeting by obtaining a proxy from your brokerage firm or bank.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of AlphaVest Acquisition Corp\nYong (David) Yan\nChief Executive Officer\nDecember 7, 2023\nYour vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting, virtually or in person, please vote as soon as possible\nby following the instructions in the accompanying Proxy Statement to make sure that your shares are represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If\nyou hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to you by your bank,\nbroker or other nominee to ensure that your shares are represented and voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting. The approval of the Extension\nAmendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of issued\nand outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or any\nadjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five\npercent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Trust Agreement. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary\nresolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a simple majority of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares\nentitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, vote on such\nmatter. The presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the holders of a majority of the Ordinary Shares\nentitled to vote as of the Record Date at the Extraordinary General Meeting shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting. Accordingly, if you fail to vote in person or by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, your shares will not be counted for the\npurposes of determining whether the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal are\napproved by the requisite majorities. If you fail to return your proxy card or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, and do not\nattend the Extraordinary General Meeting in person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum\nis present at the Extraordinary General Meeting and will not have any effect on whether the proposals are approved. If you are a shareholder of record and\nyou attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person.\nTO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST (1) IF YOU HOLD PUBLIC SHARES THROUGH UNITS, ELECT TO SEPARATE\nYOUR UNITS INTO THE UNDERLYING PUBLIC SHARES AND PUBLIC RIGHTS PRIOR TO EXERCISING YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS\nWITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHARES, (2) SUBMIT A WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE TRANSFER AGENT BY 5:00 P.M.

The end date of each Extension shall\nbe referred to herein as the “Extended Date.”\nProposal No. 2 - Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal — To resolve that AlphaVest’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 19, 2022, (as\namended, the “Trust Agreement”), by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”), be amended to allow the\nCompany to extend the Termination Date from December 22, 2023 up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine\n(9) extensions comprised of one month each up to December 22, 2024 (the “Trust Agreement Amendment”) by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee\nprior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended Date, as applicable and depositing into the trust account (the “Trust Account”), $55,000 for each month in an\nExtension (the “Extension Payment”) pursuant to an amendment to the Trust Agreement in the form set forth in Annex B of the Proxy Statement (the “Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal”).\nProposal No. 3—Adjournment Proposal— To approve as an ordinary resolution that the chairman of the Extraordinary General Meeting be directed to adjourn the\nExtraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of\nthe Extraordinary General Meeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or to\nprovide additional time to effectuate the Extension, the Extension Amendment and Trust Agreement Amendment.\nEach of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the Proxy\nStatement. Please take the time to read carefully each of the proposals in the Proxy Statement before you vote. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and\nthe Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension. In\naddition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001,\nwhich condition may not be waived by the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal\nand the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the\nExisting Charter or the Trust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nThe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow\nAlphaVest additional and flexibility to complete our previously announced Business Combination. On August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business\ncombination agreement with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and\nWanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Wanshun”). However, there can be no guarantee the business combination\nwith Merger Sub and Wanshun will be consummated. If it is not consummated, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and,\nif necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, will allow AlphaVest additional time to complete an initial business combination (a “Business Combination”). Additionally,\nthe purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal is to simultaneously (i) provide those AlphaVest shareholders who do not wish to extend the Termination Date\nwith the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights earlier than they would if AlphaVest liquidated on the Termination Date and (ii) allow those AlphaVest\nshareholders who wish for AlphaVest to continue its search for a Business Combination to remain shareholders. Currently, the Company has until the Termination\nDate, or December 22, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of\nthe Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to allow for\nadditional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination Date will not provide sufficient time to complete a Business\nCombination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to identifying a Business Combination target, circumstances\nwarrant providing shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective Business Combination. However, even if the Extension Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension are implemented,\nthere is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination within the Combination Period, as extended, given the actions that must\noccur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and the Trust Agreement, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our sponsor, AlphaVest Holding LP (the\n“Sponsor”), avail ourselves of the two (2) additional three-month extension periods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates\nor designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month\nextension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment\nProposal is approved, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or\nits affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such\nthree-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that our\nSponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business Combination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the\nSponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event\nthat we are unable to close a Business Combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our\nSponsor five days prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such\nExtension at least three days prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund\nthe Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees,\ndecide to extend the period of time to consummate our Business Combination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable\nto consummate our Business Combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of\nour outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Ordinary Shares”) which were issued in the Company’s initial public offering (the “Public\nShares”) for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and\nnot previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we\nmay not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our\ndissolution and liquidation, the rights will expire and be worthless.\nAs contemplated by the Existing Charter, in the event that any amendment is made to the Existing Charter to, among other things, modify the substance or\ntiming of the Company’s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of Public Shares (the “Public Shareholders”) may\nelect to redeem their Public Shares upon the approval of any such amendment to the Existing Charter in exchange for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then\non deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account (net of taxes paid or payable, if any), divided by the number of then outstanding\nPublic Shares (the “Redemption”). You may elect to redeem your Public Shares in connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, regardless of whether you\nvote for or against the proposals, by following the instructions set forth in the accompanying Proxy Statement. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter,\nAlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by\nthe Board.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person\nwith whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its Public Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the Company’s\nprior consent. Accordingly, if a Public Shareholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such\nshares in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for cash.\nOn the Record Date (defined below), the redemption price per Public Share was approximately $10.68 (which is expected to be the same approximate price per\nPublic Share on the date of the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting), based on the aggregate amount on deposit in the Trust Account of\napproximately $73,731,029.06 as of the Record Date (including interest not previously released to AlphaVest to pay its taxes), divided by the total number of then\noutstanding Public Shares. The closing price of the Public Shares on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) on the Record Date was $10.69. Accordingly, if the\nmarket price of the Public Shares were to remain the same until the date of the Extraordinary General Meeting, exercising redemption rights would result in a holder\nof Public Shares receiving approximately $0.01 less per share than if the Public Shares were sold in the open market. AlphaVest cannot assure Public Shareholders\nthat they will be able to sell their Public Shares in the open market, even if the market price per Public Share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there\nmay not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such Public Shareholders wish to sell their Public Shares. AlphaVest believes that such redemption right enables\nits holders of Public Shares to determine whether to sustain their investments for an additional period if AlphaVest does not complete a Business Combination on or\nbefore the Termination Date.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the\nTermination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay\nour taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely\nextinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in\neach case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nPursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder may request to redeem all or a portion of such holder’s Public Shares for cash if the Extension\nAmendment is consummated. As a holder of Public Shares, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold Public Shares or (b) hold Public Shares through Units (as defined below) and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Shares and\nPublic Rights (as defined below) prior to exercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares;\n(ii) submit a written request to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee” or “transfer agent”) including the legal name, phone number and\naddress of the beneficial owner of the Public Shares for which redemption is requested, that AlphaVest redeem all or a portion of your Public Shares for\ncash; and\n(iii)deliver your share certificates for Public Shares (if any) along with other applicable redemption forms to the Trustee, physically or electronically through\nThe Depository Trust Company (“DTC”).\nHolders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Shares in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December\n18, 2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting) in order for their Public Shares to be redeemed. Public Shareholders\nmay elect to redeem Public Shares regardless of if or how they vote in respect of the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension Amendment, Trust Agreement\nAmendment and Extension are not consummated, the Public Shares will be returned to the respective holder, broker or bank.\nSubject to the foregoing, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote\nof the holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at\nthe Extraordinary General Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has 9,180,500 Ordinary\nShares outstanding. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Ordinary Shares held by\nthe Sponsor and the representative of our underwriters in our initial public offering (the “Founder Shares”), the Company will need 3,839,834 Public Shares, or\n55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nApproval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares\npursuant to the Trust Agreement. If all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Founder Shares, the\nCompany will need 3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of a simple majority\nof the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or any\nadjournment thereof, vote on such matter. All outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Founder Shares,\nthe Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares to vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal to approve such proposal. The\nAdjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nRecord holders of Ordinary Shares at the close of business on December 7, 2023 (the “Record Date”) are entitled to vote or have their votes cast at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting. On the Record Date, there were 6,900,000 issued and outstanding Public Shares and 2,280,500 issued and outstanding Founder\nShares. AlphaVest’s rights do not have voting rights.\nThis Proxy Statement contains important information about the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Extension Amendment Proposal the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Whether or not you plan to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting, virtually or in person, AlphaVest urges\nyou to read this material carefully and vote your shares.\nThis Proxy Statement is dated December 7, 2023 and is first being mailed to shareholders on or about that date.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of AlphaVest Acquisition Corp\nYong (David) Yan\nChief Executive Officer\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 1\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING 2\nEXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF ALPHAVEST 14\nDate, Time and Place of Extraordinary General Meeting 14\nProposals at the Extraordinary General Meeting 14\nVoting Power; Record Date 14\nRecommendation of the Board 14\nQuorum and Required Vote for Proposals for the Extraordinary General Meeting 15\nVoting Your Shares—Shareholders of Record 15\nVoting Your Shares—Beneficial Owners 16\nAttending the Extraordinary General Meeting 16\nRevoking Your Proxy 17\nNo Additional Matters 17\nWho Can Answer Your Questions about Voting 17\nRedemption Rights 17\nAppraisal Rights 19\nProxy Solicitation Costs 19\nInterests of the Initial Shareholders 19\nPROPOSAL NO. 1—THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL 21\nOverview 21\nReasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal 22\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is Not Approved 23\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is Approved 23\nRedemption Rights 24\nUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations 25\nVote Required for Approval 30\nFull Text of Resolution 30\nRecommendation of the Board 30\nPROPOSAL NO. 2—THE TRUST AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROPOSAL 31\nOverview 31\nReasons for the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal 32\nIf the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is Not Approved 33\nIf the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is Approved 33\nVote Required for Approval 34\nFull Text of Resolution 34\nRecommendation of the Board 34\nPROPOSAL NO. 2—THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 35\nOverview 35\nConsequences if the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved 35\nVote Required for Approval 35\nFull Text of Resolution 35\nRecommendation of the Board 35\nRISK FACTORS 36\nBENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES 39\nHOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION 41\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION 42\nANNEX A A-1\nANNEX B B-1\ni\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements contained in this Proxy Statement constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-\nlooking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that\nare not historical facts. Forward-looking statements reflect AlphaVest’s current views with respect to, among other things, its capital resources and results of\noperations. Likewise, AlphaVest’s financial statements and all of AlphaVest’s statements regarding market conditions and results of operations are forward-looking\nstatements. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of terminology such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,”\n“continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these\nwords or other comparable words or phrases.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this Proxy Statement reflect AlphaVest’s current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and\nunknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause its actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-\nlooking statement. AlphaVest does not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they will happen at all). The following\nfactors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements:\n● AlphaVest’s ability to complete a Business Combination, including approval by the shareholders of AlphaVest;\n● the anticipated benefits of a Business Combination;\n● the volatility of the market price and liquidity of the Public Shares and other securities of AlphaVest;\n● the use of funds not held in the Trust Account or available to AlphaVest from interest income on the Trust Account balance;\n● the competitive environment in which our successor will operate following a Business Combination; and\n● proposed changes in SEC rules related to special purpose acquisition companies.\nWhile forward-looking statements reflect AlphaVest’s good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. AlphaVest disclaims any obligation to\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, new information, data or methods, future events or\nother changes after the date of this Proxy Statement, except as required by applicable law. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could cause\nAlphaVest’s future results, performance or transactions to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, please see the section entitled\n“Risk Factors” in AlphaVest’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2023, and in other reports\nAlphaVest filed with the SEC, including AlphaVest’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on May 22, 2023,\nJune 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on August 11, 2023, and September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 3, 2023. You should not place undue reliance on\nany forward-looking statements, which are based only on information currently available to AlphaVest.\n1\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING\nQ. Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement?\nA. AlphaVest is a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on January 14, 2022, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share\nexchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, with one or more businesses, without limitation as to business,\nindustry or sector. AlphaVest’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-268188) for AlphaVest’s IPO was declared effective by the SEC on December\n19, 2022. On December 22, 2022, AlphaVest consummated its IPO of 6,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share, par value $0.0001\nper share (the “Ordinary Shares”) and one right (the “Public Rights”), with each Public Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary\nShare upon the completion of an initial Business Combination, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating\ngross proceeds of $60,000,000. On December 29, 2022, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. (“EBC”) exercised its over-allotment option (the “Overallotment”), to purchase\nan additional 900,000 Units at a public offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $9,000,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of 365,000 private Units to the Sponsor, and 25,000 private Units to EBC\n(collectively, the “Private Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,900,000. Simultaneously with\nthe closing of the Overallotment, the Company completed the private sale of an additional 37,904 Private Units to the Sponsor and the private sale of an\nadditional 2,596 Private Units to EBC, each at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000.\nTransaction costs amounted to $3,734,629 consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees, $629,929 of other offering costs.\nAn aggregate of $70,380,000 of the net proceeds from AlphaVest’s IPO and sale of the units consisting of Ordinary Shares and rights sold to the Sponsor in a\nprivate placement (the “Private Placement Units” were deposited in the Trust Account established for the benefit of the holders of Public Shares.\nOn August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination agreement with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted company and a direct wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Wanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Wanshun”).\nLike most blank check companies, the Existing Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of Public Shares sold in the IPO if\nthere is no qualifying Business Combination(s) consummated on or before the Termination Date.\nCurrently, the Company has until the Termination Date, or December 22, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Board has determined that it is in\nthe best interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and\nthe Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to allow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination\nDate will not provide sufficient time to complete a Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with\nrespect to identifying a Business Combination target, circumstances warrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a\nprospective Business Combination. However, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the\nExtension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a\nBusiness Combination within the Combination Period, as extended, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\nQ. When and where is the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. The Extraordinary General Meeting will be held on December 20, 2023, at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time at the offices of Winston & Strawn LLP located at 800\nCapitol Street, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas, United States, and virtually via live webcast by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com/alphavest/2023 and entering the\nvoter control number included on your proxy card and via teleconference using the following dial-in information:\nTelephone access (listen-only):\nWithin the U.S. and Canada: 1 800-450-7155 (toll-free)\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada: 1 800-450-7155 (standard rates apply)\nConference ID: 4031986#\nQ.

Any registered shareholder at the Record Date wishing to attend the Extraordinary General Meeting virtually should register for the Extraordinary General\nMeeting at https://www.cstproxy.com/alphavest/2023. You can virtually attend the Extraordinary General Meeting via the internet by visiting\nhttps://www.cstproxy.com/alphavest/2023 and entering the voter control number included on your proxy card. You will need the voter control number included\non your proxy card in order to be able to vote your shares or submit questions during the Extraordinary General Meeting. If you do not have a voter control\nnumber, you will be able to listen to the Extraordinary General Meeting only and you will not be able to vote or submit questions during the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting.\n2\nQ. What are the specific proposals on which I am being asked to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. AlphaVest shareholders are being asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:\nProposal No. 1—Extension Amendment Proposal—A proposal, by special resolution, to amend AlphaVest’s Existing Charter by adopting the AlphaVest’s Second\nAmended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association in the form set forth in Annex A to the Proxy Statement, which reflects the extension of the date by\nwhich the Company must consummate a business combination up to ten (10) times from December 22, 2023 to December 22, 2024, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each (i.e., for a period of time ending up to 24 months after the\nconsummation of its IPO) for a total of twelve (12) months after the Termination Date (assuming a Business Combination has not occurred);\nProposal No. 2 - Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal — A proposal, by ordinary resolution, to amend AlphaVest’s Trust Agreement, by and between the Company\nand the Trustee. The Trust Agreement Amendment proposes to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date or the Extended Date, as applicable, to\nDecember 22, 2024 by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended Date and depositing into the Trust\nAccount $55,000 for each month in an Extension until December 22, 2024 (assuming a Business Combination has not occurred) in exchange for a non-interest\nbearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon the consummation of a Business Combination; and\nProposal No. 3—Adjournment Proposal—A proposal, by ordinary resolution to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to\npermit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting, there are not sufficient votes to\napprove the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or to provide additional time to effectuate the Extension Amendment,\nTrust Agreement Amendment and Extension.\nQ. Are the proposals conditioned on one another?\nA. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are conditions to the implementation of the Extension\nAmendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension. Pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would\ncause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension\nAmendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General\nMeeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nIf the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are implemented and one or more AlphaVest shareholders elect to redeem their Public\nShares, AlphaVest will remove from the Trust Account and deliver to the holders of such redeemed Public Shares an amount equal to the pro rata portion of funds\navailable in the Trust Account with respect to such redeemed Public Shares, as described in more detail in this Proxy Statement, and will retain the remainder of the\nfunds in the Trust Account for AlphaVest’s use in connection with consummating a Business Combination on or before the expiration of the last Extended Date.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the\nTermination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay\nour taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely\nextinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in\neach case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe Sponsor and all of AlphaVest’s directors and officers (the “initial shareholders”) waived their rights to participate in any liquidating distribution with respect to\nthe 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by them. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to AlphaVest’s rights, which will expire worthless in\nthe event AlphaVest dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\nThe Adjournment Proposal is not conditioned on the approval of any other proposal.\n3\nQ. Why is AlphaVest proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal?\nA. The Existing Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in the Trust Account to the holders of Public Shares sold in the IPO if there is no\nqualifying Business Combinations(s) consummated on or before the Termination Date. The purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, is to allow AlphaVest additional time and flexibility to complete our previously announced\nBusiness Combination. On August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination agreement with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman Islands exempted\ncompany and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Wanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman Islands\nexempted company (“Wanshun”). However, there can be no guarantee the business combination with Merger Sub and Wanshun will be consummated. If it is not\nconsummated, the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal, will allow\nAlphaVest additional time to complete a Business Combination. Additionally, the purpose of the Extension Amendment Proposal is to simultaneously (i) provide\nthose AlphaVest shareholders who do not wish to extend the Termination Date with the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights earlier than they would if\nAlphaVest liquidated on the Termination Date and (ii) allow those AlphaVest shareholders who wish for AlphaVest to continue its search for a Business\nCombination to remain shareholders.\nCurrently, the Company has until the Termination Date, or December 22, 2023, to consummate a Business Combination. The Board has determined that it is in the\nbest interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal to allow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination Date will not\nprovide sufficient time to complete a Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to\nconsummating a Business Combination circumstances warrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective\nBusiness Combination. However, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved and the Extension, Trust\nAgreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination\nwithin the Combination Period, as extended, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest may put the\nAdjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension\nAmendment, or to otherwise provide additional time to effectuate the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment. If the Adjournment\nProposal is not approved by AlphaVest shareholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates in the event that\nthere are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a Business Combination at this time. If the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are\nimplemented and you do not elect to redeem all your Public Shares, you will retain the right to vote on any such Business Combination when and if it is\nsubmitted to shareholders (provided that you are a shareholder on the applicable record date) and the right to redeem your remaining Public Shares for\ncash in the event a Business Combination is approved and completed or in the event we have not consummated a Business Combination by the last\nExtended Date, December 22, 2024. There is no guarantee that we will identify a suitable target and, even if we do identify one, that we will be able to\ncomplete a Business Combination before the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024.\nQ. What vote is required to approve the proposals presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. The approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of holders of at least\ntwo-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to the Trust\nAgreement, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an\nordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of a simple majority of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares\nentitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter.\nThe presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares\nentitled to vote as of the Record Date at the Extraordinary General Meeting shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting. If you fail to return your proxy card or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, and do not attend the Extraordinary General Meeting\nin person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Extraordinary General Meeting and\nwill not have any effect on whether the proposals are approved. If you are a shareholder of record and you attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and wish to vote\nin person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person.\n4\nQ. Why should I vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal?\nA. AlphaVest believes its shareholders will benefit from AlphaVest consummating a Business Combination and is proposing the Extension Amendment Proposal to\ngive the Company the right to extend the Combination Period from December 22, 2023 up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months,\nand the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each time up to December 22, 2024. The Board believes that the current Termination Date will\nnot provide sufficient time to complete a Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to\nidentifying a Business Combination target, circumstances warrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective\nBusiness Combination. However, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension\nAmendment are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the last Extended Date, given the\nactions that must occur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and the Trust Agreement,, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of the two (2) additional\nthree-month extension periods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to\nthe applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline, $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, we may, by resolution of the\nBoard, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9)\nextensions comprised of one month each to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance\nnotice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the\napplicable Business Combination deadline $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business\nCombination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the Sponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured\npromissory note equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a Business Combination\nunless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the applicable Business\nCombination deadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such Extension at least three days prior to the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable Business Combination deadline announcing whether or not\nthe funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our\nBusiness Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our Business\nCombination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our Business Combination within such time\nperiod, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in\nthe Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less\nup to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result\nof claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, rights will expire and be\nworthless.\nThe Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal.\nQ. Why should I vote “FOR” the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal?\nA. AlphaVest believes its shareholders will benefit from AlphaVest consummating a Business Combination and is proposing the Trust Agreement Amendment\nProposal to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine\n(9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date or the Extended Date, as applicable, to December 22, 2024 by providing five days’\nadvance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended Date. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources\nto date with respect to consummating a Business Combination, circumstances warrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to\nconsider a prospective Business Combination. However, even if the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement\nAmendment and Extension Amendment are implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the last\nExtended Date, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business Combination.\n5\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and the Trust Agreement,, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of the two (2) additional\nthree-month extension periods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to\nthe applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. .

In the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business\nCombination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the Sponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured\npromissory note equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a Business Combination\nunless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the applicable Business\nCombination deadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such Extension at least three days prior to the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline.

However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result\nof claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, rights will expire and be\nworthless.\nThe Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal.\nQ. Why should I vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal?\nA. If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by AlphaVest shareholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date\nor dates in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal or implementation of the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment.\nIf presented, the Board recommends that you vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.\nQ. How will the initial shareholders vote?\nA. The initial shareholders have advised AlphaVest that they intend to vote any Ordinary Shares over which they have voting control, in favor of the Extension\nAmendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal, and, if necessary, the Adjournment Proposal.\nThe initial shareholders and their respective affiliates are not entitled to redeem any Founder Shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. On the\nRecord Date, the Sponsor, AlphaVest’s directors, officers and its initial shareholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an\naggregate of 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and the officers and directors of AlphaVest, representing approximately 24.8% of AlphaVest’s issued and\noutstanding Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the Founder\nShares, the Company will need 3,839,834 Public Shares, or 55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal to\napprove such proposal. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five\npercent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares. If all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the\nFounder Shares, the Company will need 3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to\napprove such proposal.] To approve the Adjournment Proposal, assuming all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in\naddition to the Founder Shares, the Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares to vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal to approve\nsuch proposal. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n6\nQ. What if I do not want to vote “FOR” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal?\nA. If you do not want the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal to be approved, you may\n“ABSTAIN,” not vote, or vote “AGAINST” such proposal.\nIf you attend the Shareholder Meeting in person or by proxy, you may vote “AGAINST” the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment\nProposal or the Adjournment Proposal, and your Ordinary Shares will be counted for the purposes of determining whether the Extension Amendment Proposal,\nthe Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (as the case may be) are approved.\nHowever, if you fail to attend the Shareholder Meeting in person or by proxy, or if you do attend the Extraordinary General Meeting in person or by proxy but\nyou “ABSTAIN” or otherwise fail to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting, your Ordinary Shares will not be counted for the purposes of determining\nwhether the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal (as the case may be) are approved, and\nyour Ordinary Shares which are not voted at the Extraordinary General Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of such votes.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, the Adjournment Proposal will not be presented for a vote.\nQ. What happens if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved?\nA. If there are insufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal, AlphaVest may put the\nAdjournment Proposal to a vote in order to seek additional time to obtain sufficient votes in support of the Extension.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the\nTermination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up,\n(ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay\nour taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely\nextinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as\npromptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in\neach case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe Sponsor and the officers, directors and the initial shareholders of AlphaVest waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the\n2,280,500 Founder Shares held by them. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to AlphaVest’s rights, which will expire worthless in the\nevent AlphaVest dissolves and liquidates the Trust Account.\nQ. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, what happens next?\nA. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, then AlphaVest’s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association in substantially\nthe form that appears in Annex A hereto will be adopted with immediate effect and AlphaVest will proceed to file the Second Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association, together with other necessary documents, with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies and will continue its\nefforts to consummate a Business Combination on or before the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented, the removal from the Trust Account of the amount equal to the pro rata portion\nof funds available in the Trust Account with respect to such redeemed Public Shares will reduce the amount remaining in the Trust Account and increase the\npercentage interest of AlphaVest held by AlphaVest’s officers, directors, the Sponsor and its affiliates. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may\nnot redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board.\n7\nEven if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or to amend the Existing\nCharter and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nQ. If the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved, what happens next?\nA. If the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved, then AlphaVest will amend its Trust Agreement in substantially the form that appears in Annex B\nhereto and will continue its efforts to consummate a Business Combination on or before the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024.\nQ. Do I need to request that my shares be redeemed whether I vote for or against the Extension Amendment Proposal?\nA. Yes. Whether you vote for or against the Extension Amendment Proposal, you may elect to redeem your Public Shares. However, you will need to submit a\nredemption request for your Public Shares. See “How do I exercise my redemption rights?” for more information about the procedures to follow to redeem your\nPublic Shares.\nQ. May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?\nA. Yes. You may change your vote by:\n● Sending a later-dated, signed proxy card addressed to AlphaVest’s Chief Executive Officer located at AlphaVest Acquisition Corp, 420 Lexington Ave, Suite\n2446, New York, NY 10170 Attn: Yong (David) Yan, so that it is received by AlphaVest’s Secretary or Chief Executive Officer on or before the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting; or\n● Attending and voting, in person or virtually via the internet, during the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nYou also may revoke your proxy by sending a notice of revocation to AlphaVest’s Chief Executive Officer, which must be received by AlphaVest’s Chief Executive\nOfficer on or before the Extraordinary General Meeting. Attending the Extraordinary General Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked\nunless you specifically so request.\nQ. How are votes counted?\nA. Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Extraordinary General Meeting, who will separately count “FOR” and “AGAINST” votes,\n“ABSTAIN” and broker non-votes. The Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of\nthe holders of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at\nthe Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to\nthe Trust Agreement, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal\nrequires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a simple majority of the issued and outstanding\nOrdinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof,\nvote on such matter. With respect to the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal, abstentions\nand broker non-votes will have no effect on outcome of any proposal brought before the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nQ. What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?\nA. Shareholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company’s transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you\nare considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and the proxy materials were sent directly to you by the Company.\nBeneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then\nyou are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” and the proxy materials were forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your\naccount is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Extraordinary General Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that\norganization on how to vote the shares held in your account. Those instructions are contained in a “vote instruction form.”\n8\nQ. If my shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or nominee automatically vote my shares for me?\nA. No. Under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, your broker, bank, or nominee cannot vote your shares with respect to non-\ndiscretionary matters unless you provide instructions on how to vote in accordance with the information and procedures provided to you by your broker, bank, or\nnominee. AlphaVest believes that all of the proposals presented to the shareholders at this Extraordinary General Meeting will be considered non-discretionary\nand, therefore, your broker, bank, or nominee cannot vote your shares without your instruction on any of the proposals presented at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee, they may deliver a proxy card expressly indicating that it is NOT\nvoting your shares. This indication that a broker, bank, or nominee is not voting your shares is referred to as a “broker non-vote.” Abstentions and broker non-\nvotes will not count as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment\nProposal or the Adjournment Proposal. Your bank, broker or other nominee can vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote. You should\ninstruct your broker to vote your shares in accordance with directions you provide.\nQ. What constitutes a quorum at the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. A quorum is the minimum number of AlphaVest shareholders necessary to hold a valid meeting. Our Existing Charter defines a quorum, in connection with any\nmeeting that is convened to vote on a Business Combination or any meeting convened with regards to an amendment to the substance or timing of the\nCompany’s obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, as the holders (whether individuals or entities by a duly authorized\nrepresentative) of a majority of the Ordinary Shares entitled to vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nAccordingly, an AlphaVest shareholder’s failure to vote in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, will not be counted towards\nthe number of Ordinary Shares required to validly establish a quorum.\nQ. How many votes do I have?\nA. Each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote on each proposal being submitted to our shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nQ. How do I vote?\nA. If you were a holder of record of Ordinary Shares on December 7, 2023, the Record Date for the Extraordinary General Meeting, you may vote with respect to\nthe proposals yourself at the Extraordinary General Meeting, or by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid\nenvelope provided.\nVoting in Person. If you are a holder of record of Ordinary Shares on the Record Date, you may attend the Extraordinary General Meeting held at the offices of\nWinston & Strawn LLP, located at 800 Capitol Street, Suite 2400, Houston, Texas, United States.\nVoting by Mail. By signing the proxy card and returning it in the enclosed prepaid and addressed envelope, you are authorizing the individuals named on the proxy\ncard to vote your shares at the Extraordinary General Meeting in the manner you indicate. You are encouraged to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to\nattend the Extraordinary General Meeting so that your shares will be voted if you are unable to virtually attend the Extraordinary General Meeting. If you receive\nmore than one proxy card, it is an indication that your shares are held in multiple accounts. Please sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are\nvoted. Votes submitted by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m., New York Time, on December 19, 2023.\nVoting by Internet. Shareholders who have received a copy of the proxy card by mail may be able to vote over the internet by visiting https://www.cstproxy.com\n/alphavest/2023 and entering the voter control number included on your proxy card.\n9\nQ. Does the Board recommend voting “FOR” the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the\nAdjournment Proposal?\nA. Yes. After careful consideration of the terms and conditions of each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and\nAdjournment Proposal, the Board has determined that each proposal is in the best interests of AlphaVest and its shareholders. The Board recommends that\nAlphaVest shareholders vote “FOR” each of the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and Adjournment Proposal, if\npresented.\nQ. What interests do AlphaVest’s Sponsor, directors and officers have in the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal?\nA. AlphaVest’s Sponsor, directors and officers have interests in the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal that may be\ndifferent from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. These interests include, among others, ownership, directly or indirectly of Founder Shares and\nPrivate Placement Units that may become exercisable in the future. See the section entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of AlphaVest—Interests of the\nInitial Shareholders” in this Proxy Statement.\nQ. Do I have appraisal rights or dissenters’ rights if I object to the Extension Amendment Proposal?\nA. No. There are no appraisal rights available to AlphaVest shareholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal.\nQ. How are the funds in the Trust Account currently being held?\nA. The funds in the Trust Account are invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting\ncertain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) which invest only in direct U.S.\ngovernment treasury obligations.\nQ. If I am a Public Shareholder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my Public Shares?\nA. Yes. If you are a holder of Public Shares, you have the right to request that we redeem all or a portion of your Public Shares for cash provided that you follow\nthe procedures and deadlines described elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. Public Shareholders may elect to redeem all or a portion of the Public Shares held by\nthem regardless of if or how they vote in respect of proposals. If you wish to exercise your redemption rights, please see the answer to the question: “How do I\nexercise my redemption rights?”.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person\nwith whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its\nPublic Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the Company’s prior written consent. Accordingly, if a Public\nShareholder, alone or acting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such shares in excess of that 15% limit would\nnot be redeemed for cash.\nQ. If I own Public Rights, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my Public Rights?\nA. No. The holders of Public Rights have no redemption rights with respect to such Public Rights.\nQ. If I am a Unit holder, can I exercise redemption rights with respect to my Units?\nA. No. Holders of outstanding Units must separate the underlying Public Shares and Public Rights prior to exercising redemption rights with respect to the Public\nShares.\nIf you hold Units registered in your own name, you must deliver the certificate for such Units to the Trustee with written instructions to separate such Units into\nPublic Shares and Public Rights. This must be completed far enough in advance to permit the mailing of the Public Share certificates back to you so that you may\nthen exercise your redemption rights upon the separation of the Public Shares from the Units. See “How do I exercise my redemption rights?” below. The address of\nthe Trustee is listed under the question “Who can help answer my questions?” below.\n10\nIf a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee holds your Units, you must instruct such nominee to separate your Units. Your nominee must\nsend written instructions by facsimile to the Trustee. Such written instructions must include the number of Units to be split and the nominee holding such Units. Your\nnominee must also initiate electronically, using DTC’s DWAC system, a withdrawal of the relevant Units and a deposit of an equal number of Public Shares and\nPublic Rights. This must be completed far enough in advance to permit your nominee to exercise your redemption rights upon the separation of the Public Shares\nfrom the Units. While this is typically done electronically the same business day, you should allow at least one full business day to accomplish the separation. If you\nfail to cause your Public Shares to be separated in a timely manner, you will likely not be able to exercise your redemption rights.\nQ. What do I need to do now?\nA. You are urged to read carefully and consider the information contained in this Proxy Statement, including Annex A and Annex B, and to consider how the\nExtension Amendment Proposal, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal will affect you as a shareholder. You should then\nvote as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions provided in this Proxy Statement and on the enclosed proxy card or, if you hold your shares through\na brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, on the voting instruction form provided by the broker, bank or nominee.\nQ. How do I exercise my redemption rights?\nA. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Extension, Trust Agreement\nAmendment and Extension Amendment, AlphaVest shareholders may seek to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds\navailable in the Trust Account at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned\non the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to AlphaVest to pay its taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares,\nsubject to the limitations described in the final prospectus, dated December 20, 2022, filed in connection with the IPO. In addition, pursuant to the Existing\nCharter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be\nwaived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved,\nAlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may\nliquidate on the Termination Date.\nPursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder may request to redeem all or a portion of such holder’s Public Shares for cash if the Extension is\nconsummated. As a holder of Public Shares, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Shares to be redeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold Public Shares or (b) hold Public Shares through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Shares and Public Rights prior to\nexercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares;\n(ii) submit a written request to the Trustee including the legal name, phone number and address of the beneficial owner of the Public Shares for which\nredemption is requested, that AlphaVest redeem all or a portion of your Public Shares for cash; and\n(iii)deliver your share certificates for Public Shares (if any) along with other applicable redemption forms to the Trustee, physically or electronically through\nDTC.\nHolders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Shares in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 18,\n2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting) in order for their Public Shares to be redeemed. Public Shareholders may\nelect to redeem Public Shares regardless of if or how they vote in respect of the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and\nExtension Amendment are not consummated, the Public Shares will be returned to the respective holder, broker or bank. The address of AlphaVest’s transfer agent is\nlisted under the question “Who can help answer my questions?” below. AlphaVest requests that any requests for redemption include the identity as to the beneficial\nowner making such request, including such beneficial owner’s legal name, phone number, and address.\n11\nA physical share certificate will not be needed if your shares are delivered to AlphaVest’s transfer agent electronically. In order to obtain a physical share certificate,\na shareholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and AlphaVest’s transfer agent will need to act to facilitate the request. It is AlphaVest’s understanding that\nshareholders should generally allot at least one week to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because AlphaVest does not have any control\nover this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than one week to obtain a physical share certificate. If it takes longer than anticipated to\nobtain a physical certificate, shareholders who wish to redeem their shares may be unable to obtain physical certificates by the deadline for exercising their\nredemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.\nAny demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests and thereafter, with AlphaVest’s\nconsent, until a vote is taken with respect to the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment, if any. If you delivered your shares for\nredemption to the Trustee and decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may request that the Trustee return the shares\n(physically or electronically). Such requests may be made by contacting the Trustee at the phone number or address listed under the question “Who can help answer\nmy questions?”\nAlphaVest shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” are required to either tender\ntheir certificates to the transfer agent prior to the date set forth in this Proxy Statement, or up to two (2) business days prior to the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DTC’s DWAC system, at such shareholder’s option. The requirement for\nphysical or electronic delivery prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the\nExtension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension\nAmendment are effected.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system.\nThe transfer agent will typically charge a tendering broker a fee and it is in the broker’s discretion whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming shareholder.\nHowever, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not shareholders seeking to exercise redemption rights are required to tender their shares, as the need to\ndeliver shares is a requirement to exercising redemption rights, regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\nQ. What should I do if I receive more than one (1) set of voting materials for the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. You may receive more than one set of voting materials for the Extraordinary General Meeting, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and multiple\nproxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction\ncard for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive\nmore than one proxy card. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive in order to cast your vote with\nrespect to all of your shares.\nQ. Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting?\nA. AlphaVest will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting. AlphaVest has engaged Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC to assist in\nthe solicitation of proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting. AlphaVest will also reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries\nrepresenting beneficial owners of Ordinary Shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of Ordinary Shares and in obtaining\nvoting instructions from those owners. The directors, officers and employees of AlphaVest may also solicit proxies by telephone, by facsimile, by mail or on the\ninternet. They will not be paid any additional amounts for soliciting proxies.\n12\nQ. Who can help answer my questions?\nA.

The Trust Agreement Amendment proposes to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with the first\nextension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date or the Extended Date, as\napplicable, to December 22, 2024 by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended Date and\ndepositing into the Trust Account $55,000 for each month in an Extension until December 22, 2024 (assuming a Business Combination has not occurred) in\nexchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note payable upon the consummation of a Business Combination; and\n● Proposal No. 3—Adjournment Proposal—A proposal, by ordinary resolution to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary,\nto permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting, there are not sufficient votes\nto approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or to provide additional time to effectuate the Extension\nAmendment, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension.\nVoting Power; Record Date\nAs a shareholder of AlphaVest, you have a right to vote on certain matters affecting AlphaVest. The proposals that will be presented at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting and upon which you are being asked to vote are summarized above and fully set forth in this Proxy Statement. You will be entitled to vote or direct votes to\nbe cast at the Extraordinary General Meeting if you own Ordinary Shares at the close of business on December 7, 2023, which is the Record Date for the\nExtraordinary General Meeting. You are entitled to one (1) vote for each Ordinary Share that you own as of the close of business on the Record Date. If your shares\nare held in “street name” or are in a margin or similar account, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you\nbeneficially own are properly counted. On the Record Date, there were 9,180,500 issued and outstanding shares, of which 6,900,000 shares were held by holders of\nPublic Shares and 2,280,500 Founder Shares were held by the initial shareholders.\nRecommendation of the Board\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS\nTHAT YOU VOTE “FOR” EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS\n14\nQuorum and Required Vote for Proposals for the Extraordinary General Meeting\nThe presence, in person (including virtually) or by proxy, at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Ordinary Shares\nentitled to vote as of the Record Date at the Extraordinary General Meeting shall constitute a quorum for the conduct of business at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting. If you fail to return your proxy card or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, and do not attend the Extraordinary General Meeting\nin person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Extraordinary General Meeting and\nwill not have any effect on whether the proposals are approved. If you are a shareholder of record and you attend the Extraordinary General Meeting and wish to vote\nin person, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person.\nThe approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\ntwo-thirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the\naffirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution\nunder Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a simple majority of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and\nwho, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter.\nOn the Record Date, the Sponsor, AlphaVest’s directors, officers and its initial shareholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to\nvote an aggregate of 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and the officers and directors of AlphaVest, representing approximately 24.8% of AlphaVest’s\nissued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the\nFounder Shares, the Company will need 3,839,834 Public Shares, or 55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal\nto approve such proposal. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five\npercent (65%) of the then outstanding Ordinary Shares. If all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the\nFounder Shares, the Company will need 3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to\napprove such proposal. To approve the Adjournment Proposal, assuming all of outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in\naddition to the Founder Shares, the Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares outstanding to vote in favor of the Adjournment\nProposal to approve such proposal. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment\nProposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nIt is possible that AlphaVest will not be able to complete its initial Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, or by the last Extended\nDate, December 22, 2024, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved. If AlphaVest fails to\ncomplete its initial Business Combination on or before the Termination Date, or by the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024, if the Extension\nAmendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest will be required to dissolve and liquidate the Trust Account\nby returning the then remaining funds in such account to the holders of Public Shares.\nVoting Your Shares—Shareholders of Record\nIf you are an AlphaVest shareholder of record, you may vote in person, by mail, internet or telephone. Each Ordinary Share that you own in your name entitles\nyou to one (1) vote on each of the proposals for the Extraordinary General Meeting.

If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be\nexchanging your Public Shares for cash and will no longer own the shares. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in\nan amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\neven if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary\nGeneral Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nPursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder may request to redeem all or a portion of such holder’s Public Shares for cash if the Extension, Trust\nAgreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are consummated. As a holder of Public Shares, you will be entitled to receive cash for any Public Shares to be\nredeemed only if you:\n(i) (a) hold Public Shares or (b) hold Public Shares through Units and elect to separate your Units into the underlying Public Shares and Public Rights prior to\nexercising your redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares;\n(ii) submit a written request to the Trustee including the legal name, phone number and address of the beneficial owner of the Public Shares for which\nredemption is requested, that AlphaVest redeem all or a portion of your Public Shares for cash; and\n(iii) deliver your share certificates for Public Shares (if any) along with other applicable redemption forms to the Trustee, physically or electronically through\nDTC.\n17\nHolders must complete the procedures for electing to redeem their Public Shares in the manner described above prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on December\n18, 2023 (two business days prior to the scheduled vote at the Extraordinary General Meeting) in order for their Public Shares to be redeemed. Public Shareholders\nmay elect to redeem Public Shares regardless of if or how they vote in respect of the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment\nand Extension Amendment are not consummated, the Public Shares will be returned to the respective holder, broker or bank. The address of AlphaVest’s transfer\nagent is listed under the question “Who can help answer my questions?” below. AlphaVest requests that any requests for redemption include the identity as to the\nbeneficial owner making such request, including such beneficial owner’s legal name, phone number, and address.\nA physical share certificate will not be needed if your shares are delivered to AlphaVest’s transfer agent electronically. In order to obtain a physical share\ncertificate, a shareholder’s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and AlphaVest’s transfer agent will need to act to facilitate the request. It is AlphaVest’s understanding\nthat shareholders should generally allot at least one week to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because AlphaVest does not have any\ncontrol over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than one week to obtain a physical share certificate. If it takes longer than\nanticipated to obtain a physical certificate, shareholders who wish to redeem their shares may be unable to obtain physical certificates by the deadline for exercising\ntheir redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.\nAny demand for redemption, once made, may be withdrawn at any time until the deadline for exercising redemption requests and thereafter, with AlphaVest’s\nconsent, until a vote is taken with respect to the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment, if any. If you delivered your shares for\nredemption to the Trustee and decide within the required timeframe not to exercise your redemption rights, you may request that the Trustee return the shares\n(physically or electronically). Such requests may be made by contacting the Trustee at the phone number or address listed under the question “Who can help answer\nmy questions?”\nAlphaVest shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” are required to either\ntender their certificates to the transfer agent prior to the date set forth in this Proxy Statement, or up to two (2) business days prior to the scheduled vote at the\nExtraordinary General Meeting, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DTC’s DWAC system, at such shareholder’s option. The\nrequirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable\nonce the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and\nExtension Amendment are effected.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC\nsystem. The transfer agent will typically charge a tendering broker a fee and it is in the broker’s discretion whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming\nshareholder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not shareholders seeking to exercise redemption rights are required to tender their shares,\nas the need to deliver shares is a requirement to exercising redemption rights, regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.\nEach redemption of a Public Share by holders of Public Shares will reduce the amount in the Trust Account, which held marketable securities with a fair value\nof approximately $73,731,029.06 as of the Record Date. Prior to their exercising redemption rights, AlphaVest shareholders should verify the market price of the\nOrdinary Shares, as shareholders may receive higher proceeds from the sale of their Ordinary Shares in the public market than from exercising their redemption\nrights if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price. There is no assurance that you will be able to sell your Public Shares in the open market, even\nif the market price per share is lower than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in the Ordinary Shares when you wish to sell\nyour shares.\nIf you exercise your redemption rights, your Public Shares will cease to be outstanding and will only represent the right to receive a pro rata share of\nthe aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account. You will have no right to participate in, or have any interest in, the future growth of AlphaVest, if\nany. You will be entitled to receive cash for your Public Shares only if you properly and timely demand redemption.\n18\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person\nwith whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its\nPublic Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the Company’s consent. Accordingly, if a Public Shareholder, alone or\nacting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such shares in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for\ncash.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and\nExtension Amendment implemented, and if and a Business Combination is not consummated by the Termination Date, or such later date that may be approved by\nAlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest will be required to dissolve and liquidate the Trust Account by returning the then remaining funds in such account to the holders\nof Public Shares and all of AlphaVest’s rights will expire worthless.\nAppraisal Rights\nThere are no appraisal rights available to AlphaVest shareholders in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal.\nProxy Solicitation Costs\nAlphaVest is soliciting proxies on behalf of the Board. This proxy solicitation is being made by mail, but also may be made by telephone or on the internet.\nAlphaVest has engaged Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Extraordinary General Meeting. AlphaVest and its directors,\nofficers and employees may also solicit proxies on the internet. AlphaVest will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward this\nProxy Statement and the related proxy materials to their principals and to obtain their authority to execute proxies and voting instructions.\nAlphaVest will bear the entire cost of the proxy solicitation, including the preparation, assembly, printing, mailing and distribution of this Proxy Statement and\nthe related proxy materials. AlphaVest will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding this Proxy\nStatement and the related proxy materials to AlphaVest shareholders. Directors, officers and employees of AlphaVest who solicit proxies will not be paid any\nadditional compensation for soliciting.\nInterests of the Initial Shareholders\nIn considering the recommendation of the Board to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal\nshareholders should be aware that, aside from their interests as shareholders, the initial shareholders have interests in consummating a Business Combination that are\ndifferent from, or in addition to, those of other shareholders generally. AlphaVest’s directors are aware of and will consider these interests, among other matters, in\nevaluating a potential Business Combination, in recommending to shareholders that they approve a Business Combination and in agreeing to vote their shares in\nfavor of a Business Combination. Shareholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to approve a Business Combination. These interests\ninclude, among other things:\n● If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by\nthe Termination Date, or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest will cease all operations except for the purpose of\nwinding up, redeeming 100% of the outstanding AlphaVest Public Shares for cash and, subject to the approval of its remaining shareholders and the Board,\ndissolving and liquidating. In such event, the Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and AlphaVest’s directors and officers, which were acquired for an\naggregate purchase price of $25,000 prior to the IPO, or approximately $0.014 per share, would be worthless because the holders are not entitled to\nparticipate in any redemption or distribution with respect to such shares. Such shares had an aggregate market value of $18,440,250 based upon the closing\nprice of $10.69 per share on Nasdaq on the Record Date.\n19\n● Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of 365,000 Private Units to the Sponsor, and 25,000 Private Units to EBC at a\npurchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,900,000. On December 29, 2022, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc.\nexercised the Overallotment to purchase an additional 900,000 Units at a public offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to\nthe Company of $9,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Overallotment, the Company completed the private sale of an additional 37,904 Private\nUnits to the Sponsor and the private sale of an additional 2,596 Private Units to EBC, each at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating\nadditional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000. The Private Placement Units and Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Placement Units will\nbecome worthless if AlphaVest does not consummate a business combination by the Termination Date or such later date that may be approved by AlphaVest\nshareholders in accordance with the Existing Charter.\n● The Sponsor and AlphaVest’s directors and officers paid significantly less for their Founder Shares than other Public Shareholders paid for their Public\nShares purchased in the IPO or shares purchased in the open market thereafter. As a result, if a Business Combination is completed, the Sponsor, officers\nand directors are likely to be able to make a substantial profit on their investment in us even at a time when the Ordinary Shares have lost significant value.\nOn the other hand, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are not approved and the Company liquidates\nwithout completing its Business Combination before the Termination Date, the Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us.\n● Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or by a\nprospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below\n(i) $10.20 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to\nreductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to\nany claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity\nof the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.\n● The Existing Charter contains a waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine, and there could have been Business Combination targets that have been\nappropriate for a combination with AlphaVest but were not offered due to an AlphaVest director’s duties to another entity. AlphaVest does not believe that\nthe waiver of the corporate opportunity doctrine in its Existing Charter interfered with its ability to identify an acquisition target.\nAdditionally, if the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved and AlphaVest consummates an initial\nBusiness Combination, the officers and directors of AlphaVest may have additional interests as described in the Proxy Statement/prospectus for such transaction.\n20\nPROPOSAL NO. 1—THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\nOverview\nAlphaVest is a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on January 14, 2022, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share\nexchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, with one or more businesses, without limitation as to business, industry\nor sector. AlphaVest has reviewed, and continues to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a Business Combination, but we are not able to determine at this\ntime whether we will complete a Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have\nneither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the\nExchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.\nOn December 22, 2022, AlphaVest consummated its IPO of 6,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one\nPublic Right, with each Public Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the completion of an initial Business Combination,\nsubject to adjustment. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. On December 29, 2022, EBC exercised\nits over-allotment option, to purchase an additional 900,000 Units at a public offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company\nof $9,000,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of 365,000 private units to the Sponsor, and 25,000 private units to EBC\n(collectively, the “Private Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,900,000. Simultaneously with the\nclosing of the Overallotment, the Company completed the private sale of an additional 37,904 Private Units to the Sponsor and the private sale of an additional 2,596\nPrivate Units to EBC, each at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000. Transaction costs\namounted to $3,734,629 consisting of $1,725,000 of underwriting fees, $629,929 of other offering costs.\nLike most blank check companies, the Existing Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of Public Shares sold in the IPO if\nthere is no qualifying Business Combination(s) consummated on or before the Termination Date.\nAlphaVest is proposing to amend its Existing Charter to give the Company the right to extend the Combination Period from December 22, 2023 up to ten (10)\ntimes, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each up to December 22, 2024 (i.e., for a\nperiod of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its IPO) by depositing into the Trust Account, for each three-month extension, the Extension\nPayment after giving effect to the Redemption. A copy of the proposed Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of AlphaVest is\nattached to this Proxy Statement as part of Annex A.\nProposed Business Combination\nOn August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination agreement (the “Wanshun Business Combination Agreement”) with AV Merger Sub, a Cayman\nIslands exempted company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Wanshun Technology Industrial Group Limited, a Cayman\nIslands exempted company (“Wanshun”).\nPursuant to the terms of the Wanshun Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between the Company and Wanshun will be effected through the\nmerger of Merger Sub with and into Wanshun, with Wanshun surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger,” and together with\nthe transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the other agreements contemplated thereby, the “Transactions”).\n21\nReasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal\nThe Existing Charter currently provides that AlphaVest has until the Termination Date to complete an initial Business Combination. AlphaVest and its officers\nand directors agreed that they would not seek to amend the Existing Charter to allow for a longer period of time to complete a Business Combination unless\nAlphaVest provided holders of its Public Shares with the right to seek redemption of their Public Shares in connection therewith. The Board has determined that it is\nin the best interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal to\nallow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination Date will not provide sufficient time to complete\na Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to a Business Combination, circumstances\nwarrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective Business Combination. However, even if the Extension\nAmendment Proposal is approved and the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are implemented, there is no assurance that\nAlphaVest will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a\nBusiness Combination.\nUnder the Existing Charter, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of the two (2) additional three-month extension\nperiods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable Business\nCombination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, we may, by resolution of the Board, at\nthe request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions\ncomprised of one month each to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance notice prior to\nthe applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the applicable\nBusiness Combination deadline $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the time to complete a Business Combination,\npay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the Sponsor will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note\nequal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a Business Combination unless there are\nfunds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the applicable Business Combination\ndeadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such Extension at least three days prior to the applicable Business\nCombination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable Business Combination deadline announcing whether or not the\nfunds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the time for us to complete our\nBusiness Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our Business\nCombination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our Business Combination within such time\nperiod, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in\nthe Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less\nup to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result\nof claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the rights will expire and be\nworthless.\n22\nThe Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing AlphaVest additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business\nCombination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is a condition to the\nimplementation of the Extension and Extension Amendment. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount\nthat would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the\nExtension Amendment Proposal is approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Existing\nCharter and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is Not Approved\nThe approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to the implementation of our Board’s plan to extend the date by which we must consummate our\ninitial Business Combination. Therefore, our Board will abandon and not implement the Extension and Extension Amendment unless our shareholders approve the\nExtension Amendment Proposal and the other conditions to implementing the Extension and Extension Amendment are satisfied or waived. If the Extension\nAmendment Proposal is not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the Termination Date, or such later date that may be approved by\nAlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest shall (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten\nbusiness days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including\ninterest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),\ndivided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the\nright to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to\nthe approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for\nclaims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe initial shareholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by them. There\nwill be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to AlphaVest’s rights, which will expire worthless in the event AlphaVest dissolves and liquidates the\nTrust Account.\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is Approved\nIf the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, AlphaVest’s Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, in substantially the\nform that appears in Annex A hereto, will be adopted with immediate effect and AlphaVest will proceed to file the Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and\nArticles of Association, together with other necessary documents, with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies. The Company’s Second Amended and Restated\nMemorandum and Articles of Association gives the Company the right to extend the Combination Period from December 22, 2023 up to ten (10) times, with the first\nextension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each up to December 22, 2024 (i.e., for a period of time ending\nup to 24 months after the consummation of its IPO). AlphaVest will then continue to attempt to consummate a Business Combination until the last Extended Date,\nDecember 22, 2024. AlphaVest will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act and its Units, Public Shares and Public Rights will remain publicly traded\nduring this time.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a Business Combination at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to\nredeem your Public Shares, provided that you are a shareholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a Business Combination, you will retain the right to vote\non a Business Combination when it is submitted to shareholders and the right to redeem your Public Shares for cash in the event a Business Combination is approved\nand completed or we have not consummated a Business Combination by the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024. If AlphaVest enters into a definitive agreement\nwith a target to consummate a Business Combination, the vote by AlphaVest shareholders to approve such Business Combination will occur at a separate meeting of\nAlphaVest shareholders, to be held at a later date, and the solicitation of proxies from AlphaVest shareholders in connection with such separate meeting, and the\nrelated right of AlphaVest shareholders to redeem in connection with such Business Combination (which is a separate right to redeem in addition to the right to\nredeem in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal), will be the subject of a separate Proxy Statement/prospectus. If you want to ensure your Public\nShares are redeemed in the event the Extension Amendment Proposal is implemented, you should elect to “redeem” your Public Shares in connection with the\nExtraordinary General Meeting.\n23\nRedemption Rights\nIn connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal and contingent upon the effectiveness of the implementation of the Extension, Trust Agreement\nAmendment and Extension Amendment, each Public Shareholder may seek to redeem all or a portion of its Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available\nin the Trust Account, less any taxes owed on such funds but not yet paid. If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your Public Shares for cash\nand will no longer own the shares. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net\ntangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension Amendment\nProposal is approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the Trust\nAgreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our Existing Charter, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such Public Shareholder or any other person\nwith whom such Public Shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its\nPublic Shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the Company’s consent. Accordingly, if a Public Shareholder, alone or\nacting in concert or as a group, seeks to redeem more than 15% of the Public Shares, then any such shares in excess of that 15% limit would not be redeemed for\ncash.\nPlease see the section titled “Extraordinary General Meeting—Redemption Rights” for more information on how to exercise your redemption rights.\n24\nUNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR SHAREHOLDERS EXERCISING\nREDEMPTION RIGHTS\nThe following is a discussion of U.S. federal income tax considerations generally applicable to U.S. Holders (as defined below) that elect to have their Public\nShares redeemed for cash if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved. This discussion applies only to Public Shares that are held as capital assets for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not describe all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be\nrelevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or status, including:\n● the Sponsor or our directors and officers;\n● financial institutions or financial services entities;\n● broker-dealers;\n● taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market method of accounting;\n● tax-exempt entities;\n● governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof;\n● insurance companies;\n● regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;\n● expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States;\n● persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of our voting shares or five percent or more of the total value of all classes of our shares;\n● persons that acquired Public Shares pursuant to an exercise of employee share options or upon payout of a restricted share unit, in connection with\nemployee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation or in connection with the performance of services;\n● persons that hold Public Shares as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction;\n● persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;\n● controlled foreign corporations; or\n● passive foreign investment companies.\nThis discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), proposed, temporary and final Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code,\nand judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof. All of the foregoing is subject to change, which change could apply retroactively and\ncould affect the tax considerations described herein. This discussion does not address U.S. federal taxes other than those pertaining to U.S. federal income taxation\n(such as estate or gift taxes, the alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax on net investment income), nor does it address any aspects of U.S. state or local or non-\nU.S. taxation.\n25\nWe have not and do not intend to seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the exercise of redemption rights. There can be no\nassurance that the IRS will not take positions inconsistent with the considerations discussed below or that any such positions would not be sustained by a court.\nThis discussion does not consider the tax treatment of partnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a\npartnership (or any entity or arrangement so characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds Public Shares, the tax treatment of such partnership and a\nperson treated as a partner of such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding any Public\nShares and persons that are treated as partners of such partnerships should consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of an\nexercise of redemption rights to them.\nEACH HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH\nHOLDER OF AN EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S.\nTAX LAWS.\nAs used herein, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Public Shares who or that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n● a citizen or individual resident of the United States;\n● a corporation (or other entity that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or\norganized) in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;\n● an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or\n● a trust if (i) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all\nsubstantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person.\nRedemption of Public Shares\nIn addition to the PFIC considerations discussed below under “— PFIC Considerations,” the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the redemption of a U.S.\nHolder’s Public Shares pursuant to an exercise of redemption rights will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of such shares redeemed under Section\n302 of the Code or is treated as a distribution under Section 301 of the Code.\nIf the redemption qualifies as a sale of Public Shares, a U.S. Holder will be treated as described below under the section entitled “— Gain or Loss on Sale,\nTaxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Public Shares.” If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of Public Shares, a U.S. Holder will be treated as\nreceiving a distribution with the tax consequences described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Distributions.”\nThe redemption of Public Shares will generally qualify as a sale of the Public Shares that are redeemed if such redemption (i) is “substantially disproportionate”\nwith respect to the redeeming U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete termination” of such U.S. Holder’s interest or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend”\nwith respect to such U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.\nFor purposes of such tests, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only ordinary shares actually owned by such U.S. Holder, but also ordinary shares that are\nconstructively owned by such U.S. Holder. A redeeming U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to ordinary shares owned directly, ordinary shares owned\nby certain related individuals and entities in which such U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any ordinary shares such\nU.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option.\n26\nThe redemption of ordinary shares will generally be “substantially disproportionate” with respect to a redeeming U.S. Holder if the percentage of the respective\nentity’s outstanding voting shares that such U.S. Holder actually or constructively owns immediately after the redemption is less than 80% of the percentage of the\nrespective entity’s outstanding voting shares that such U.S. Holder actually or constructively owned immediately before the redemption. Prior to an initial business\ncombination, the Public Shares may not be treated as voting shares for this purpose and, consequently, this substantially disproportionate test may not be applicable.\nThere will be a complete termination of such U.S. Holder’s interest if either (i) all of the ordinary shares actually or constructively owned by such U.S. Holder are\nredeemed or (ii) all of the ordinary shares actually owned by such U.S. Holder are redeemed and such U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in\naccordance with specific rules, the attribution of ordinary shares owned by certain family members and such U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other\nordinary shares. The redemption of Public Shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if it results in a “meaningful reduction” of such U.S. Holder’s\nproportionate interest in the respective entity. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in such U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest will depend\non the particular facts and circumstances applicable to it. The IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a\nsmall minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.”\nIf none of the foregoing tests is satisfied, then the redemption of Public Shares will be treated as a distribution to the redeeming holder and the tax effects to such\nU.S. Holder will be as described below under the section entitled “— Taxation of Distributions.” After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the\nU.S. Holder in the redeemed Public Shares will be added to such holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares. If there are no remaining shares, a U.S. Holder\nshould consult its tax adviser as to the allocation of remaining basis.\nU.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption, including any special reporting requirements.\nTaxation of Distributions.\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below under “— PFIC Considerations,” if the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Public Shares is treated as a distribution, as\ndiscussed above, such distribution will generally be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated\nearnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Such dividends will be taxable to a corporate U.S. Holder at regular rates and will not\nbe eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. With\nrespect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, dividends will generally be taxed at preferential long-term capital gains rates only if (i) Public Shares are readily tradable on\nan established securities market in the United States or (ii) Public Shares are eligible for the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty, in each case provided that the\nCompany is not treated as a PFIC in the taxable year in which the dividend was paid or in any previous year and certain holding period and other requirements are\nmet. Because we believe it is likely that we were a PFIC for our prior taxable year ended December 31, 2022, it is likely that the lower applicable long-term capital\ngains rate would not apply to any redemption proceeds treated as a distribution. Moreover, it is unclear whether redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares\nmay prevent the holding period of such shares from commencing prior to the termination of such rights. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the\navailability of the lower rate for any redemption treated as a dividend with respect to Public Shares.\nDistributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will generally constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce\n(but not below zero) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Public Shares. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition\nof the Public Shares and will be treated as described below under the section entitled “— Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of\nPublic Shares.”\nGain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Public Shares.\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below under “— PFIC Considerations,” if the redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Public Shares is treated as a sale or other\ntaxable disposition, as discussed above, a U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount\nrealized and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Public Shares redeemed.\n27\nUnder tax law currently in effect, long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at a reduced\nrate of tax. Capital gain or loss will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the ordinary shares exceeds one year at the time of\ndisposition. However, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the Public Shares described in this proxy statement may prevent the holding period\nof the Public Shares from commencing prior to the termination of such rights. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to various limitations. U.S. Holders who\nhold different blocks of Public Shares (Public Shares purchased or acquired on different dates or at different prices) should consult their tax advisors to determine\nhow the above rules apply to them.\nPFIC Considerations\nA foreign corporation will be a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if at least 75% of its gross income in a\ntaxable year is passive income. Alternatively, a foreign corporation will be a PFIC if at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year of the foreign corporation, ordinarily\ndetermined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally\nincludes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than certain rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and net gains from the\ndisposition of passive assets.\nBecause we are a blank check company, with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or income test for our\ncurrent taxable year. However, pursuant to a start-up exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income (the\n“start-up year”), if (i) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (ii) the corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the two taxable years\nfollowing the start-up year; and (iii) the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years. The applicability of the start-up exception to us is uncertain and\nwill not be known until after the close of our current taxable year (or possibly not until after the close of the first two taxable years following our start-up year, as\ndescribed under the start-up exception). After the acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination, we may still meet one of the PFIC tests depending on\nthe timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets as well as the passive income and assets of the acquired business. If the company that\nwe acquire in a business combination is a PFIC, then we will likely not qualify for the start-up exception and will be a PFIC for our current taxable year. Our actual\nPFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly, there\ncan be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nIf we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder and the U.S. Holder did not\nmake a timely and effective “qualified election fund” election (a “QEF Election”) for each of our taxable years as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held Public\nShares, a QEF Election along with a purging election, or a “mark-to-market” election, then such holder will generally be subject to special rules (the “Default PFIC\nRegime”) with respect to:\n● any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Public Shares; and\n● any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater\nthan 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of its ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such\nU.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for such ordinary shares).\n28\nUnder the Default PFIC Regime:\n● the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for its Public Shares;\n● the amount of gain allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the\nperiod in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of the first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income;\n● the amount of gain allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in such U.S. Holder’s holding period will be taxed\nat the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and\n● an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder in respect of the tax\nattributable to each such other taxable year of such U.S. Holder.\nTHE PFIC RULES ARE VERY COMPLEX AND ARE IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nALL U.S. HOLDERS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE PFIC RULES TO THE\nREDEMPTION OF PUBLIC SHARES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WHETHER A QEF ELECTION, A PURGING ELECTION, A\nMARK-TO-MARKET ELECTION, OR ANY OTHER ELECTION IS AVAILABLE AND THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF MAKING OR\nHAVING MADE ANY SUCH ELECTION, AND THE IMPACT OF ANY PROPOSED OR FINAL PFIC TREASURY REGULATIONS.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nPayments of cash to a U.S. Holder as a result of the redemption of Public Shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible U.S. backup\nwithholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes other required\ncertifications, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and establishes such exempt status.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability,\nand the U.S. Holder generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for\nrefund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n29\nVote Required for Approval\nThe approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal requires a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of two-\nthirds (2/3) of the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General\nMeeting or any adjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Failure to vote in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting,\nabstentions from voting or broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Extension Amendment Proposal.\nOn the Record Date, the Sponsor, AlphaVest’s directors, officers and its initial shareholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to\nvote an aggregate of 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and the officers and directors of AlphaVest, representing approximately 24.8% of AlphaVest’s\nissued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company will need\n3,839,834 Public Shares, or 55.6% of the outstanding Public Shares, to vote in favor of the Extension Amendment Proposal to approve such proposal.\nOur Board will abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment unless our shareholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net\ntangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Extension Amendment\nProposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to\namend the Existing Charter or the Trust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nFull Text of Resolution\n“It is resolved as a special resolution, that the AlphaVest’s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, dated as of December 19, 2022\n(the “Existing Charter”) be deleted in its entirety and in substitution in their place the AlphaVest Second Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation in the form set forth in Annex A to the Proxy Statement (the “Extension Amendment”) be adopted which reflects the extension of the date by which the\nCompany must consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) from December 22, 2023 (the “Termination Date”) up to ten (10) times, with the\nfirst extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each (each an “Extension”) up to December 22, 2024 (i.e.,\nfor a period of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its initial public offering) (the “IPO”)) for a total of twelve (12) months after the Termination\nDate (assuming a Business Combination has not occurred). The end date of each Extension shall be referred to herein as the “Extended Date”.”\nRecommendation of the Board\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT ALPHAVEST SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR”\nTHE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\nOur Board expresses no opinion as to whether you should redeem your Public Shares.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors or\nofficers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for\nhimself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of\nAlphaVest—Interests of the Initial Shareholders” for a further discussion.\n30\nPROPOSAL NO. 2—THE TRUST AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROPOSAL\nOverview\nAlphaVest is a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on January 14, 2022, for the purpose of effecting a merger, share\nexchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination, with one or more businesses, without limitation as to business, industry\nor sector. AlphaVest has reviewed, and continues to review, a number of opportunities to enter into a Business Combination, but we are not able to determine at this\ntime whether we will complete a Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have\nneither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the\nExchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.\nOn December 22, 2022, AlphaVest consummated its IPO of 6,000,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Share, par value $0.0001 per share, and one\nPublic Right, with each Public Right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the completion of an initial Business Combination,\nsubject to adjustment. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. On December 29, 2022, EBC exercised\nits over-allotment option, to purchase an additional 900,000 Units at a public offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company\nof $9,000,000.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company completed the sale of 365,000 Private Units to the Sponsor, and 25,000 Private Units to EBC at a\npurchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,900,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Overallotment, the\nCompany completed the private sale of an additional 37,904 Private Units to the Sponsor and the private sale of an additional 2,596 Private Units to EBC, each at a\npurchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000. Transaction costs amounted to $3,734,629 consisting of\n$1,725,000 of underwriting fees, $629,929 of other offering costs.\nLike most blank check companies, the Existing Charter provides for the return of the IPO proceeds held in trust to the holders of Public Shares sold in the IPO if\nthere is no qualifying Business Combination(s) consummated on or before the Termination Date.\nAlphaVest is proposing to amend its Trust Agreement to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date up to ten (10) times, with the first extension\ncomprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each from the Termination Date or the Extended Date, as applicable, to\nDecember 22, 2024 by providing five days’ advance notice to the Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date or Extended Date, as applicable, and by depositing\ninto the Trust Account, for each three-month extension, the Extension Payment after giving effect to the Redemption. A copy of the proposed amendment to the\nTrust Agreement is attached to this Proxy Statement as part of Annex B.\nProposed Business Combination\nOn August 11, 2023, AlphaVest entered into a business combination agreement with, Merger Sub and Wanshun.\nPursuant to the terms of the Wanshun Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between the Company and Wanshun will be effected through the\nmerger of Merger Sub with and into Wanshun, with Wanshun surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\n31\nReasons for the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal\nThe Trust Agreement currently provides that AlphaVest has until the Termination Date to complete an initial Business Combination. The Board has determined\nthat it is in the best interests of AlphaVest to seek an extension of the Termination Date and have AlphaVest shareholders approve the Trust Agreement Amendment\nProposal to allow for additional time to consummate a Business Combination. The Board believes that the current Termination Date will not provide sufficient time\nto complete a Business Combination. Given AlphaVest’s commitment of time, effort and financial resources to date with respect to identifying a Business\nCombination target, circumstances warrant providing Public Shareholders with additional time and opportunity to consider a prospective Business Combination.\nHowever, even if the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved and the Trust Agreement Amendment is implemented, there is no assurance that AlphaVest\nwill be able to consummate a Business Combination by the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024, given the actions that must occur prior to closing of a Business\nCombination.\nPursuant to the Existing Charter and Trust Agreement, we may, by resolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of the three (3)\nadditional three-month extension periods to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon five days’ advance\nnotice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior to the date of the\napplicable Business Combination deadline $690,000, (or $0.10 per share) for each extension. . If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, we may, by\nresolution of the Board, at the request of our Sponsor, avail ourselves of ten (10) extension periods, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the\nsubsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each to consummate the Business Combination, subject to the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon\nfive days’ advance notice prior to the applicable Business Combination deadline, depositing into the Trust Account for each such three-month extension, on or prior\nto the date of the applicable Business Combination deadline $55,000 for each month in an Extension. In the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the time to\ncomplete a Business Combination, pay the Extension Payment, and deposit the Extension Payment into the Trust Account, the Sponsor will receive a non-interest\nbearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of the Extension Payment, which amount will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a\nBusiness Combination unless there are funds available outside the Trust Account to do so. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor five days prior to the\napplicable Business Combination deadline of its wish for us to effect an Extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such Extension at least three days\nprior to the applicable Business Combination deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable Business Combination deadline\nannouncing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the Trust Account to extend the\ntime for us to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees, decide to extend the period of time to\nconsummate our Business Combination, such affiliates or designees may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our Business\nCombination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our Public Shares for a pro\nrata portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously\nreleased to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interests to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to\ndistribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our Public Shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and\nliquidation, the rights will expire and be worthless.\nThe Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is essential to allowing AlphaVest additional time to consummate a Business Combination in the event a Business\nCombination is for any reason not completed on or before the Termination Date. Approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is a condition to the\nimplementation of the Trust Agreement Amendment. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would\ncause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal is approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Trust\nAgreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\n32\nIf the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is Not Approved\nThe approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is essential to the implementation of our Board’s plan to extend the date by which we must\nconsummate our initial Business Combination. Therefore, our Board will abandon and not implement the Trust Agreement Amendment unless our shareholders\napprove the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and the other conditions to implementing the Trust Agreement Amendment are satisfied or waived. If the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal is not approved and a Business Combination is not consummated by the Termination Date, or such later date that may be approved\nby AlphaVest shareholders, AlphaVest (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten\nbusiness days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including\ninterest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses),\ndivided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the\nright to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to\nthe approval of our remaining shareholders and the Board, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for\nclaims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe initial shareholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to the 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by them. There\nwill be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to AlphaVest’s rights, which will expire worthless in the event AlphaVest dissolves and liquidates the\nTrust Account.\nIf the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is Approved\nIf the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is approved, the Company will then continue to attempt to consummate a business combination until the\napplicable Termination Date or until the Board determines in its sole discretion that it will not be able to consummate an initial business combination by the\napplicable Termination Date as described below and does not wish to seek an additional extension.\nYou are not being asked to vote on a Business Combination at the Extraordinary General Meeting. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to\nredeem your Public Shares, provided that you are a shareholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a Business Combination, you will retain the right to vote\non a Business Combination when it is submitted to shareholders and the right to redeem your Public Shares for cash in the event a Business Combination is approved\nand completed or we have not consummated a Business Combination by the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024. If AlphaVest enters into a definitive agreement\nwith a target to consummate a Business Combination, the vote by AlphaVest shareholders to approve such Business Combination will occur at a separate meeting of\nAlphaVest shareholders, to be held at a later date, and the solicitation of proxies from AlphaVest shareholders in connection with such separate meeting, and the\nrelated right of AlphaVest shareholders to redeem in connection with such Business Combination (which is a separate right to redeem in addition to the right to\nredeem in connection with the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal), will be the subject of a separate Proxy Statement/prospectus. If you want to ensure your\nPublic Shares are redeemed in the event the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal is implemented, you should elect to “redeem” your Public Shares in connection\nwith the Extraordinary General Meeting.\n33\nVote Required for Approval\nApproval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal requires pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the affirmative vote of at least sixty-five percent (65%) of the\nthen outstanding Ordinary Shares. Failure to vote in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, abstentions from voting or broker\nnon-votes will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal.\nOn the Record Date, the Sponsor, AlphaVest’s directors, officers and its initial shareholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to\nvote an aggregate of 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and the officers and directors of AlphaVest, representing approximately 24.8% of AlphaVest’s\nissued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, if all outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition to the\nFounder Shares, the Company will need 3,686,825 Public Shares or 53.4% of the Public Shares to vote in favor of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal to\napprove such proposal.\nOur Board will abandon and not implement the Trust Agreement Amendment unless our shareholders approve the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and\nthe Extension Amendment Proposal. In addition, pursuant to the Existing Charter, AlphaVest may not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause our net\ntangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, which condition may not be waived by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if the Trust Agreement\nAmendment Proposal is approved, AlphaVest may nevertheless choose not to hold the Extraordinary General Meeting or not to amend the Existing Charter or the\nTrust Agreement and may liquidate on the Termination Date.\nFull Text of Resolution\n“It is resolved that the AlphaVest’s investment management trust agreement, dated as of December 19, 2022 (as amended, the “Trust Agreement”), by and\nbetween the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the “Trustee”) be amended to allow the Company to extend the Termination Date from\nDecember 22, 2023 up to ten (10) times, with the first extension comprised of three months, and the subsequent nine (9) extensions comprised of one month each up\nto December 22, 2024 (i.e., for a period of time ending up to 24 months after the consummation of its initial public offering) by providing five days advance notice to\nthe Trustee prior to the applicable Termination Date and depositing into the trust account (the “Trust Account”), $55,000 for each month in an Extension (the\n“Extension Payment”) until December 22, 2024 pursuant to an amendment to the Trust Agreement in the form set forth in Annex B of the accompanying Proxy\nStatement.”\nRecommendation of the Board\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT ALPHAVEST SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR”\nTHE TRUST AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROPOSAL.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors or\nofficers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for\nhimself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of\nAlphaVest—Interests of the Initial Shareholders” for a further discussion.\n34\nPROPOSAL NO. 3—THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL\nOverview\nThe Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow the Board to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of\nproxies, or to provide additional time to effectuate the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment. The Adjournment Proposal will only be\npresented to AlphaVest shareholders in the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to\napprove the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or in the event that the Board determines that additional time is necessary\nto effectuate the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment.\nConsequences if the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved\nIf the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by AlphaVest shareholders, the Board may not be able to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a later date\nin the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the Extension Amendment\nProposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal.\nVote Required for Approval\nApproval of the Adjournment Proposal requires an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of the holders of a simple majority\nof the issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and who, being present in person or represented by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting or any\nadjournment thereof, vote on such matter. Failure to vote in person (including virtually) or by proxy at the Extraordinary General Meeting, abstentions from voting or\nbroker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal.\nOn the Record Date, the Sponsor, AlphaVest’s directors, officers and its initial shareholders and their respective affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to\nvote an aggregate of 2,280,500 Founder Shares held by the Sponsor and the officers and directors of AlphaVest, representing approximately 24.8% of AlphaVest’s\nissued and outstanding Ordinary Shares. Accordingly, assuming all of outstanding Ordinary Shares are present at the Extraordinary General Meeting, then in addition\nto the Founder Shares, the Company will need 2,309,751 or 33.5% of the outstanding Public Shares to vote in favor of the Adjournment Proposal to approve such\nproposal. The Adjournment Proposal will only be put forth for a vote if there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust\nAgreement Amendment Proposal at the Extraordinary General Meeting.\nFull Text of Resolution\n“It is resolved as an ordinary resolution that the chairman of the Extraordinary General Meeting be directed to adjourn the Extraordinary General Meeting to a\nlater date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Extraordinary General Meeting,\nthere are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal or to provide additional time to effectuate\nthe Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment.”\nRecommendation of the Board\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT ALPHAVEST SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR”\nTHE APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.\nThe existence of financial and personal interests of our directors and officers may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors or\nofficers between what he, she or they may believe is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and what he, she or they may believe is best for\nhimself, herself or themselves in determining to recommend that shareholders vote for the proposals. See the section entitled “Extraordinary General Meeting of\nAlphaVest—Interests of the Initial Shareholders” for a further discussion.\n35\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on\nMarch 31, 2023, and in other reports AlphaVest filed with the SEC, including AlphaVest’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2023,\nfiled with the SEC on May 22, 2023, June 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on August 11, 2023, and September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 3, 2023, and in\nother reports we file with the SEC before making a decision to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement or to redeem or continue to hold your Public\nShares. Furthermore, if any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected or we could\nface liquidation. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties\ndescribed in the aforementioned filings and below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently\nbelieve are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results or result in our liquidation.\nThere are no assurances that the Extension Amendment, the Trust Agreement Amendment and Extensions will enable us to complete an initial Business\nCombination.\nApproving the Extension Amendment, the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and Extension involves a number of risks. Even if the Extension Amendment,\nthe Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and Extensions are approved, the Company can provide no assurances that an initial Business Combination will be\nconsummated prior to the expiration of the last Extended Date, December 22, 2024. Our ability to consummate an initial Business Combination is dependent on a\nvariety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. If the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal are approved and the\nother conditions to implementing the Extension, Trust Agreement Amendment and Extension Amendment are satisfied or waived, the Company expects to continue\nto work to consummate its initial Business Combination and shareholder approval of such initial Business Combination. We are required to offer shareholders the\nopportunity to redeem shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, and we will be required to offer shareholders redemption rights again in\nconnection with any shareholder vote to approve an initial Business Combination. Even if the Extension, Extension Amendment, or initial Business Combination are\napproved by our shareholders, it is possible that redemptions will leave us with insufficient cash to consummate an initial Business Combination on commercially\nacceptable terms, or at all. The fact that we will have separate redemption periods in connection with the Extension, Extension Amendment, and an initial Business\nCombination vote could exacerbate these risks. Other than in connection with a redemption offer or liquidation, our shareholders may be unable to recover their\ninvestment except through sales of our shares on the open market. The price of our shares may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that shareholders will be\nable to dispose of our shares at favorable prices, or at all.\nThe SEC has recently issued proposed rules to regulate special purpose acquisition companies. Certain of the procedures that we, a potential Business\nCombination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with such proposals may increase our costs and the time needed to complete an initial\nBusiness Combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete a Business Combination. The need for compliance with the SPAC\nRule Proposals (as defined below) may cause us to liquidate the funds in the Trust Account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise\nchoose.\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the “SPAC Rule Proposals”) relating, among other items, to disclosures in SEC filings in connection with\nBusiness Combination transactions between special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”) such as us and private operating companies; the financial statement\nrequirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projections in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination\ntransactions; the potential liability of certain participants in proposed Business Combination transactions; and the extent to which SPACs could become subject to\nregulation under the Investment Company Act, including a proposed rule that would provide SPACs a safe harbor from treatment as an investment company if they\nsatisfy certain conditions that limit a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities. The SPAC Rule Proposals have not yet been adopted and\nmay be adopted in the proposed form or in a different form that could impose additional regulatory requirements on SPACs.\n36\nCertain of the procedures that we, a potential initial Business Combination target, or others may determine to undertake in connection with the SPAC Rule\nProposals, or pursuant to the SEC’s views expressed in the SPAC Rule Proposals, may increase the costs and time of negotiating and completing a Business\nCombination, and may make it more difficult to complete an initial Business Combination. The need for compliance with the SPAC Rule Proposals may cause us to\nliquidate the funds in the Trust Account or liquidate the Company at an earlier time than we might otherwise choose.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would be required to institute burdensome compliance\nrequirements and our activities would be severely restricted and, as a result, we may abandon our efforts to consummate a Business Combination and liquidate\nthe Company.\nAs described further above, the SPAC Rule Proposals relate, among other matters, to the circumstances in which SPACs such as the Company could potentially\nbe subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. The SPAC Rule Proposals would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the\ndefinition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that a SPAC satisfies certain criteria, including a limited\ntime period to announce and complete a Business Combination. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the SPAC Rule Proposals would require a company to\nfile a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for a Business Combination no later than 18 months after the\neffective date of its registration statement for its initial public offering (the “IPO Registration Statement”). The Company would then be required to complete a\nBusiness Combination no later than 24 months after the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement.\nBecause the SPAC Rule Proposals have not yet been adopted, there is currently uncertainty concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to a\nSPAC, including a company like ours, where it has been less than 18 months since the effective date of its IPO Registration Statement. We do not believe that our\nprincipal activities will subject us to regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, if we are deemed to be an investment\ncompany and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require\nadditional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete the Business Combination and our activities would be severely\nrestricted. In addition, we would be subject to additional burdensome regulatory requirements and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. As a result, if we\nbelieve we may be deemed to be an are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may determine, in our discretion, to liquidate the\nsecurities held in the Trust Account prior to the 18-month anniversary if we have not entered into an agreement with a target company for a Business Combination\nprior to that time, or may determine in our discretion to otherwise due so prior to the 24-month anniversary, and instead hold all funds in the Trust Account in cash or\nan interest-bearing bank deposit account, which may earn less interest than we otherwise would have if the Trust Account had remained invested in U.S. government\nsecurities or money market funds. This may mean that the amount of funds available for redemption would not increase, or would only minimally increase, thereby\nreducing the dollar amount our Public Shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. Alternatively, if we believe we may be\ndeemed to be an are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may determine we may abandon our efforts to consummate a Business\nCombination and instead liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate, you may lose all or part of your investment in the Company and our investors would\nnot be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and rights\nfollowing such a transaction, and our rights would expire and become worthless.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination of a foreign target if it becomes subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities\npursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or regulations.\nCertain acquisitions or business combinations may be subject to review or approval by regulatory authorities pursuant to certain U.S. or foreign laws or\nregulations. In the event that such regulatory approval or clearance is not obtained, or the review process is extended beyond the period of time that would permit an\ninitial Business Combination to be consummated by us with any foreign target (including, but not limited to, a Singapore target), we may not be able to consummate\nan initial Business Combination with such target.\n37\nFor example, among other things, the U.S. Federal Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals, governments, and corporations from owning more than a\nspecified percentage of the capital stock of a broadcast, common carrier, or aeronautical radio station licensee. In addition, U.S. law currently restricts foreign\nownership of U.S. airlines. In the United States, certain mergers that may affect competition may require certain filings and review by the Department of Justice and\nthe Federal Trade Commission, and investments or acquisitions that may affect national security are subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the\nUnited States. CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States by foreign persons in\norder to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States.\nOutside the United States, laws or regulations may affect our ability to consummate a Business Combination. Transactions with potential target companies\nincorporated or having business operations in a jurisdiction where national security considerations, involvement in regulated industries (including\ntelecommunications), or in businesses relating to a country’s culture or heritage may be implicated.\nU.S. and foreign regulators generally have the power to deny the ability of the parties to consummate a transaction or to condition approval of a transaction on\nspecified terms and conditions, which may not be acceptable to us or a target. In such event, we may not be able to consummate a Business Combination.\nAs a result of these various restrictions, even though a Business Combination may be approved by the Board, a governmental or regulatory body may intervene\nand prevent the transaction from occurring. Moreover, the process of government review, could be lengthy. Because we currently only have a limited time to\ncomplete a Business Combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our public\nstockholders may only receive $10.68 per share, and our rights will expire worthless. This will also cause you to lose any potential investment opportunity in a target\ncompany and the chance of realizing future gains on your investment through any price appreciation in the combined company.\nOur ability to complete a business combination may be impacted by the fact that our Sponsor’s major shareholder, Pengfei Zheng, is a non-U.S. person, and\na majority of our officers and directors are located in or have significant ties to the People’s Republic of China, including, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. This\nmay make us a less attractive partner to potential target companies outside the PRC, thereby limiting our pool of acquisition candidates and making it harder for\nus to complete an initial business combination with a non-China-based target company. For example, we may not be able to complete an initial business\ncombination with a U.S. target company since such initial business combination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S.\ngovernment entity, such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), or ultimately prohibited.\nOur Sponsor is currently controlled by Mr. Pengfei Zheng. In addition, a majority of our directors and officers are located in, or have significant ties to,\nChina, including Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. As a result, we may be a less attractive partner to potential target companies outside the PRC, thereby limiting our\npool of acquisition candidates. This would impact our search for a target company and make it harder for us to complete an initial business combination with a non-\nChina-based target company. For example, we may not be able to complete an initial business combination with a U.S. target company since such initial business\ncombination may be subject to U.S. foreign investment regulations and review by a U.S. government entity. Certain federally licensed businesses in the United\nStates, such as broadcasters and airlines, may be subject to rules or regulations that limit foreign ownership. In addition, CFIUS is an interagency committee\nauthorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States by foreign persons in order to determine the effect of such transactions on\nthe national security of the United States. We may be considered a “foreign person” under such rules and regulations and any proposed business combination\nbetween us and a U.S. business engaged in a regulated industry or which may affect national security could be subject to such foreign ownership restrictions and/or\nCFIUS review.\nThe scope of CFIUS was expanded by the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (“FIRRMA”) to include certain non-passive, non-\ncontrolling investments in sensitive U.S. businesses and certain acquisitions of real estate even with no underlying U.S. business. FIRRMA and subsequent\nimplementing regulations that are now in force also subject certain categories of investments to mandatory filings. If our potential initial business combination with a\nU.S. business falls within the scope of foreign ownership restrictions, we may be unable to consummate a business combination with such business.\nIn addition, if our potential business combination falls within CFIUS’s jurisdiction, we may be required to make a mandatory filing, determine to submit a\nvoluntary notice to CFIUS, or proceed with the initial business combination without notifying CFIUS and then bear the risk of CFIUS intervention, before or after\nclosing the initial business combination. CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial business combination, impose conditions to mitigate national security\nconcerns with respect to such initial business combination or order us to divest all or a portion of a U.S. business of the combined company if we had proceeded\nwithout first obtaining CFIUS clearance. The foreign ownership limitations, and the potential impact of CFIUS, may limit the attractiveness of a transaction with us\nor prevent us from pursuing certain initial business combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. As a result,\nthe pool of potential targets with which we could complete an initial business combination may be limited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing\nwith other special purpose acquisition companies which do not have similar foreign ownership issues.\nMoreover, the process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we currently only have 9 months (or 18 months if\nwe extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals\nwithin the requisite time period may prevent us from completing the transaction and require us to liquidate. If we liquidate, our Public Shareholders may only receive\n$10.68 per share initially, and our rights will expire worthless. Our Public Shareholders may also lose the potential investment opportunity in a target company and\nthe opportunity of realizing future gains on such investments through any price appreciation in the combined company.\n38\nBENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of AlphaVest’s Ordinary Shares as of the Record Date based on information\nobtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of AlphaVest’s Ordinary Shares, by:\n● each person known by AlphaVest to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of AlphaVest’s outstanding Ordinary Shares;\n● each of AlphaVest’s executive officers and directors that beneficially owns Ordinary Shares; and\n● all AlphaVest’s executive officers and directors as a group.\nBeneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if such\nperson possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options, rights, and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable\nwithin sixty days.\nIn the table below, percentage ownership is based on 9,180,500 outstanding shares (including 6,900,000 Public Shares and 2,280,500 Founder Shares) issued\nand outstanding as of the Record Date.\nVoting power represents the combined voting power of Ordinary Shares owned beneficially by such person. On all matters to be voted upon, the holders of the\nOrdinary Shares vote together as a single class. The table below does not include the Ordinary Shares underlying the Private Placement Units held or to be held by\nthe Sponsor because these securities are not exercisable within 60 days of this Proxy Statement.\nUnless otherwise indicated, AlphaVest believes that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all Ordinary Shares\nbeneficially owned by them.\n39\nPercentage of\nOutstanding\nNumber of Shares Ordinary\nName and Address of Beneficial Owner (1) Beneficially Owned Shares\nAlphaVest Holding LP (2) 1,092,904 11.9%\nPeace Capital Limited (2) 1,035,000 11.3\nPengfei Zheng(2) 2,127,904 23.2%\nYong (David) Yan(3) - -%\nSong (Steve) Jing(3) - -%\nShu Wang - -\nLi (Helen) Wei\nAll executive officers and directors as a group (6 individuals) 2,127,904 23.2%\nWealthspring Capital LLC (4) 47,000 5.2%\n(1) Unless otherwise noted, the business address of each of the following entities or individuals is c/o AlphaVest Acquisition Corp, 420 Lexington Ave, Suite 2446,\nNew York, NY 10170.\n(2) Our Sponsor is the record holder of founder shares reported herein.

This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate\ninformation received at any one household and helps to reduce AlphaVest’s expenses. However, if shareholders prefer to receive multiple sets of AlphaVest’s\ndisclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the shareholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is\nshared with another shareholder and together both of the shareholders would like to receive only a single set of AlphaVest’s disclosure documents, the shareholders\nshould follow these instructions:\n● if the shares are registered in the name of the shareholder, the shareholder should contact AlphaVest at the following address:\nAlphaVest Acquisition Corp\n420 Lexington Ave, Suite 2446,\nNew York, NY 10170\n(203) 998-5540\n● if a broker, bank or nominee holds the shares, the shareholder should contact the broker, bank or nominee directly.\n41\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\nAlphaVest files annual, quarterly and current reports, Proxy Statements and other information with the SEC as required by the Exchange Act.

For the avoidance of doubt, the same email may be sent to the email address of more than one director (and to the email address of\nthe Company pursuant to Article 17.4(c)).\n17.2 Without limitation to the preceding Article, a director may appoint an alternate for a particular meeting by sending an email to his fellow directors informing\nthem that they are to take such email as notice of such appointment for such meeting. Such appointment shall be effective without the need for a signed\nnotice of appointment or the giving of notice to the Company in accordance with Article 17.4.\n17.3 A director may revoke his appointment of an alternate at any time.

Persons on the committee may include non-directors so\nlong as the majority of those persons are directors.\n19.2 The delegation may be collateral with, or to the exclusion of, the directors’ own powers.\n19.3 The delegation may be on such terms as the directors think fit, including provision for the committee itself to delegate to a sub-committee; save that any\ndelegation must be capable of being revoked or altered by the directors at will.\n19.4 Unless otherwise permitted by the directors, a committee must follow the procedures prescribed for the taking of decisions by directors.\n19.5 The directors may adopt formal written charters for committees and, if so adopted, shall review and assess the adequacy of such formal written charters on\nan annual basis.

Any power of attorney or other appointment may also authorise the attorney or authorised signatory to\ndelegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in that person.\nPower to appoint a proxy\n19.9 Any director may appoint any other person, including another director, to represent him at any meeting of the directors. If a director appoints a proxy, then\nfor all purposes the presence or vote of the proxy shall be deemed to be that of the appointing director.\n19.10 Articles 17.1 to 17.4 inclusive (relating to the appointment by directors of alternate directors) apply, mutatis mutandis, to the appointment of proxies by\ndirectors.\n19.11 A proxy is an agent of the director appointing him and is not an Officer.\n20.

If votes are equal the chairman may, if he wishes, exercise a casting\nvote.\nValidity\n20.10 Anything done at a meeting of directors is unaffected by the fact that it is later discovered that any person was not properly appointed, or had ceased to be a\ndirector, or was otherwise not entitled to vote.\nRecording of dissent\n20.11 A director present at a meeting of directors shall be presumed to have assented to any action taken at that meeting unless:\n(a) his dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or\n(b) he has filed with the meeting before it is concluded signed dissent from that action; or\n(c) he has forwarded to the Company as soon as practical following the conclusion of that meeting signed dissent.\nA director who votes in favour of an action is not entitled to record his dissent to it.\n33\nWritten resolutions\n20.12 The directors may pass a resolution in writing without holding a meeting if all directors sign a document or sign several documents in the like form each\nsigned by one or more of those directors.\n20.13 Despite the foregoing, a resolution in writing signed by a validly appointed alternate director or by a validly appointed proxy need not also be signed by the\nappointing director. If a written resolution is signed personally by the appointing director, it need not also be signed by his alternate or proxy.\n20.14 Such written resolution shall be as effective as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly convened and held; and it shall be treated as having\nbeen passed on the day and at the time that the last director signs.\nSole director’s minute\n20.15 Where a sole director signs a minute recording his decision on a question, that record shall constitute the passing of a resolution in those terms.\n21.

In particular, the director may\nbe a director, secretary or officer of, or employed by, or be a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, that other\nbody corporate.\n21.3 Such disclosure may be made at a meeting of the board or otherwise (and, if otherwise, it must be made in writing). The director must disclose the nature\nand extent of his direct or indirect interest in or duty in relation to a transaction or arrangement or series of transactions or arrangements with the Company\nor in which the Company has any material interest.\n21.4 If a director has made disclosure in accordance with the preceding Article, then he shall not, by reason only of his office, be accountable to the Company for\nany benefit that he derives from any such transaction or arrangement or from any such office or employment or from any interest in any such body\ncorporate, and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any such interest or benefit.\nNotification of interests\n21.5 For the purposes of the preceding Articles:\n(a) a general notice that a director gives to the other directors that he is to be regarded as having an interest of the nature and extent specified in the\nnotice in any transaction or arrangement in which a specified person or class of persons is interested shall be deemed to be a disclosure that he has\nan interest in or duty in relation to any such transaction of the nature and extent so specified; and\n(b) an interest of which a director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest\nof his.\n34\nVoting where a director is interested in a matter\n21.6 A director may vote at a meeting of directors on any resolution concerning a matter in which that director has an interest or duty, whether directly or\nindirectly, so long as that director discloses any material interest pursuant to these Articles.

If the director votes on the resolution, his vote shall be counted.\n21.7 Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment of two or more directors to offices or employment with the Company or any body\ncorporate in which the Company is interested, the proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director separately and each of the directors\nconcerned shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum in respect of each resolution except that concerning his or her own appointment.\n22.

For the purpose of paragraph (b) of the preceding Article, subject to any Applicable Law or regulation, the cheque or\nwarrant shall be made to the order of the Member holding that Share or other person entitled to the Share or to his nominee, whether nominated in writing or\nin an Electronic Record, and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a good discharge to the Company.\n26.10 If two or more persons are registered as the holders of the Share or are jointly entitled to it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the registered holder\n(Joint Holders), a dividend (or other amount) payable on or in respect of that Share may be paid as follows:\n(a) to the registered address of the Joint Holder of the Share who is named first on the Register of Members or to the registered address of the deceased\nor bankrupt holder, as the case may be; or\n(b) to the address or bank account of another person nominated by the Joint Holders, whether that nomination is in writing or in an Electronic Record.\n26.11 Any Joint Holder of a Share may give a valid receipt for a dividend (or other amount) payable in respect of that Share.\nDividends or other moneys not to bear interest in absence of special rights\n26.12 Unless provided for by the rights attached to a Share, no dividend or other monies payable by the Company in respect of a Share shall bear interest.\nDividends unable to be paid or unclaimed\n26.13 If a dividend cannot be paid to a Member or remains unclaimed within six weeks after it was declared or both, the directors may pay it into a separate\naccount in the Company’s name. If a dividend is paid into a separate account, the Company shall not be constituted trustee in respect of that account and the\ndividend shall remain a debt due to the Member.\n26.14 A dividend that remains unclaimed for a period of six years after it became due for payment shall be forfeited to, and shall cease to remain owing by, the\nCompany.\n27.
