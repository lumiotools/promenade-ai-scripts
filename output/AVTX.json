(Nasdaq: AVTX), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of immune dysregulation, today announced that it has received $69.4 million in gross proceeds from the full exercise of the warrants issued in a March 2024 private placement.\n\n_“We appreciate the outstanding support of our investors by fully exercising their warrants from the private placement earlier this year. While our primary focus remains on the execution of our Phase 2 LOTUS trial in hidradenitis suppurativa, we are excited to expand the AVTX-009 program into additional inflammatory indications,”_ said Dr. Garry Neil, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. _“We are hard at work identifying our next indication, the launch and execution of which will benefit from our improved cash position and extended cash runway.”_\n\nThe warrants were issued as part of the private placement in March 2024 that was led by Commodore Capital and TCGX, with participation from BVF Partners, Deep Track Capital, OrbiMed, Petrichor, and RA Capital Management. 11,967,526 warrants were issued and all have been exercised at an exercise price of $5.796933 per underlying share of common stock, resulting in gross proceeds to Avalo of $69.4 million and the issuance of 781,259 shares of common stock and 11,186.267 shares of series C non-voting convertible preferred stock. As of November 8, 2024, Avalo has 10,463,633 shares of common stock outstanding and 24,895.92 shares of series C preferred stock outstanding. Each share of series C preferred stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations.\n\n**About Avalo Therapeutics**\n\nAvalo Therapeutics is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of immune dysregulation. Avalo’s lead asset is AVTX-009, an anti-IL-1β mAb, targeting inflammatory diseases. Avalo also has two additional drug candidates, which include quisovalimab (anti-LIGHT mAb) and AVTX-008 (BTLA agonist fusion protein). For more information about Avalo, please visit [www.avalotx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vt5DXwL12WXDI8v5blKgq0cPDR4Q1CVoEdGuIsENJGpsvtQRaLIEd-5jDOD8sA36IR9bine3fqddufj3dBwTAg==).\n\n**About AVTX-009**\n\nAVTX-009 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that binds to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with high affinity and neutralizes its activity. IL-1β is a central driver in the inflammatory process. Overproduction or dysregulation of IL-1β is implicated in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-1β is a major, validated target for therapeutic intervention. There is evidence that inhibition of IL-1β could be effective in hidradenitis suppurativa and a variety of inflammatory diseases in dermatology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology.\n\n**About the LOTUS Trial**\n\nThe LOTUS Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 trial with two AVTX-009 dose regimens to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AVTX-009 in approximately 180 adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive either one of two dosing regimens of AVTX-009 or placebo during a 16-week treatment phase. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR75) at Week 16. Secondary objectives include but are not limited to: proportion of patients achieving HiSCR50 and HiSCR90 as well as change from baseline in: International HS Severity Score System (IHS4), draining fistula count, abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count and patients achieving at least a 30% reduction on a numerical rating scale in Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain (PGA Skin Pain). The number of patients with anti-drug antibodies, safety, and tolerability will be assessed. For additional information this trial ([NCT06603077](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TthcMBySSbfMm8HE3yNX2WEi39zdOJ0X-lW4UD4NpRb625jKsO4HkUH_vSKCfHaEO2CrC6Q82WZXwNiQHObWHLO4PN3NV0DVgt9ScReZ--g=)), please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\n**About Hidradenitis Suppurativa**\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and tunnels that form in areas of the body such as the armpits, groin, and buttocks, severely impacting the quality of life of affected individuals.1 HS is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed and therefore estimates of HS vary between 0.2-1.7% of the population worldwide.2-5 The exact cause of HS is not fully understood but is believed to involve a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. While advances in treatment have been made, limited treatment options are available. IL-1β plays a crucial role in the inflammatory cascade underlying HS, contributing to tissue damage, inflammation, and disease progression. Given the involvement of IL-1β in the inflammatory process of HS, we believe therapies that target IL-1β offer a potential treatment option for HS.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: AVTX), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the treatment of immune dysregulation, today announced business updates and financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n_“We made significant progress in the third quarter and have dosed the first HS patient in our Phase 2 LOTUS trial of AVTX-009_ , _a promising monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, a key player in inflammation. This achievement moves us closer to offering a vital new treatment for HS patients, with topline data anticipated in 2026. Our goal with the LOTUS trial is to showcase AVTX-009’s potential as a leading treatment for HS due to its potency, specificity, and convenient dosing. We’re committed to executing the trial effectively and exploring AVTX-009’s broader applications for other immune-mediated diseases as we work toward the selection of our second indication,”_ said Dr. Garry Neil, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Avalo Therapeutics.\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights and Upcoming Anticipated Milestones:**\n\n  * In October 2024, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 2 LOTUS trial for the treatment of HS. \n    * The Phase 2 LOTUS trial is a global study in approximately 180 adults with HS to assess the efficacy and safety of convenient subcutaneous bi-weekly and monthly dosing regimens of AVTX-009, compared to placebo.\n    * Topline data is expected in 2026.\n  * Avalo continues to evaluate AVTX-009 in additional immune-mediated diseases as it works toward the selection of a second indication.\n  * Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and through November 6, 2024, Avalo received $58.1 million from the exercise of warrants issued in the first quarter of 2024 private placement. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Update:**\n\n  * **Cash and cash equivalents** were $81.9 million as of September 30, 2024. Net cash used in operating activities was $34.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which includes a $7.5 million milestone payment to AlmataBio, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the acquisition in the first quarter. Subsequent to September 30, 2024 and through November 6, 2024, Avalo received gross proceeds of $58.1 million pursuant to the exercise of 10,026,847 warrants which resulted in the issuance of 711,580 shares of common stock and 9,315.267 shares of preferred stock. Each share of preferred stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. The Company’s current cash on hand is expected to fund operations into at least 2027. \n  * **Research and development expenses** were $9.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $8.3 million compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily due to AVTX-009 LOTUS trial initiation and development costs. \n  * **General and administrative expenses** were $4.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.8 million compared to $2.5 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as increased consulting, legal and other professional expenses following the acquisition and financing that took place in the first quarter of 2024. \n  * **Net income** was $23.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net loss of $5.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase to net income was driven by a $37.4 million increase to other income, net which largely related to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability for the period, partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above. Basic net income per share, based on 5,546,257 weighted average common shares, was $0.98 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a basic net loss per share of $26.83, based on 194,851 weighted average common shares outstanding, for the same period in 2023. Diluted net loss per share, based on 10,784,037 weighted average diluted common shares and which excludes the change in fair value of the warrant liability from diluted net loss, was $2.83 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $26.83, based on 194,851 weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, for the same period in 2023. \n\n\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets** _(In thousands, except share and per share data)_\n\n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 81,858 | $ | 7,415  \nOther receivables | 998 | 136  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 3,251 | 843  \nRestricted cash, current portion | 41 | 1  \nTotal current assets | 86,148 | 8,395  \nProperty and equipment, net | 1,674 | 1,965  \nGoodwill | 10,502 | 10,502  \nRestricted cash, net of current portion | 131 | 131  \nTotal assets | $ | 98,455 | $ | 20,993  \n**Liabilities, mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nAccounts payable | $ | 1,811 | $ | 446  \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities | 7,033 | 4,172  \nWarrant liability | 46,830 | —  \nContingent consideration | 5,000 | —  \nTotal current liabilities | 60,674 | 4,618  \nRoyalty obligation | 2,000 | 2,000  \nDeferred tax liability, net | 154 | 155  \nDerivative liability | 11,810 | 5,550  \nOther long-term liabilities | 1,083 | 1,366  \nTotal liabilities | 75,721 | 13,689  \nMezzanine equity:  \nSeries C Preferred Stock—$0.001 par value;

Avalo’s lead asset is AVTX-009, an anti-IL-1β mAb, targeting inflammatory diseases. Avalo also has two additional drug candidates, which include quisovalimab (anti-LIGHT mAb) and AVTX-008 (BTLA agonist fusion protein). For more information about Avalo, please visit [www.avalotx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=P0XaoFgajj66CMhGmb6ge7KoyX2vL6fTU_sxMuX0Pdlj_1K1nMjfwaEuU2QtnoL4rM6nmNnUkCZ1aJJ4Br-0PA==).\n\n**About AVTX-009**\n\nAVTX-009 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4) that binds to interleukin-1β (IL-1β) with high affinity and neutralizes its activity. IL-1β is a central driver in the inflammatory process. Overproduction or dysregulation of IL-1β is implicated in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. IL-1β is a major, validated target for therapeutic intervention. There is evidence that inhibition of IL-1β could be effective in hidradenitis suppurativa and a variety of inflammatory diseases in dermatology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology.\n\n**About the LOTUS Trial**\n\nThe LOTUS Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase 2 trial with two AVTX-009 dose regimens to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AVTX-009 in approximately 180 adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive either one of two dosing regimens of AVTX-009 or placebo during a 16-week treatment phase. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR75) at Week 16. Secondary objectives include but are not limited to: proportion of patients achieving HiSCR50 and HiSCR90 as well as change from baseline in: International HS Severity Score System (IHS4), draining fistula count, abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count and patients achieving at least a 30% reduction on a numerical rating scale in Patient's Global Assessment of Skin Pain (PGA Skin Pain). The number of patients with anti-drug antibodies, safety, and tolerability will be assessed. For additional information this trial ([NCT06603077](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8ymiuJXArm9eWuctR6n9V1FGq1JX7GQcdKOl9W-_1M3udOdNXMAsJj6GQwEAW7a0Iw_twS-v3LkCoycWNRWeArYSKzS8uKo6HfUExqtJjr4=)), please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n\n**About Hidradenitis Suppurativa**\n\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and tunnels that form in areas of the body such as the armpits, groin, and buttocks, severely impacting the quality of life of affected individuals.1 HS is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed and therefore estimates of HS vary between 0.2-1.7% of the population worldwide.2-5 The exact cause of HS is not fully understood but is believed to involve a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. While advances in treatment have been made, limited treatment options are available. IL-1β plays a crucial role in the inflammatory cascade underlying HS, contributing to tissue damage, inflammation, and disease progression. Given the involvement of IL-1β in the inflammatory process of HS, we believe therapies that target IL-1β offer a potential treatment option for HS.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements made pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
