The awards recognize small businesses for their notable achievements in establishing business excellence using Thryv solutions. The awards feature three categories focusing on small business evolution, productivity and growth. \n\nThe winners are: \n\nSmall Business Growth Award : When Britney and Marc David made the bold decision to leave their careers and start a home inspection business, [TrueMark Home Inspections](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.truemarkfl.com%2Fhome-inspection-services&esheet=54155514&newsitemid=20241120494365&lan=en-US&anchor=TrueMark+Home+Inspections&index=2&md5=8a99d708c4c174a9fb51f049919b2002), the couple prioritized the need for robust support and strategic management, leading them to Thryv Business Center™ and Thryv Marketing Center™. With Thryv’s suite of tools and personalized support, the Davids quickly established operations with an efficient estimate and invoicing process, professional website and high-impact marketing campaigns, setting a solid foundation for growth. As their new business flourished, so did their entrepreneurial spirit. They soon expanded, opening a second business, [Custom Wood & Design Co](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.customwoodanddesignco.com%2F&esheet=54155514&newsitemid=20241120494365&lan=en-US&anchor=Custom+Wood+%26amp%3B+Design+Co&index=3&md5=138f16b4d47f3c85bdc354415d971cf1)., in the spring of 2024. “Having such strong growth can be hard for a small business to manage but with Thryv we have everything in place to build on that growth and create strong customer relationships. We’re booked several months in advance,” said the Davids. \n\nSmall Business Evolution Award : Kevin Binkley, owner of tax return business [The Balance Sheet](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebalancesheetservice.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwY2xjawFzvrZleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZ5LJXtkDN2C43HcPUm4hhHPyi7XTLJ_Nb69Euo5IQHcmnqmXxgZ1AS6YA_aem_9PoZF7Q7lLt4zRJcZ-Nalg&esheet=54155514&newsitemid=20241120494365&lan=en-US&anchor=The+Balance+Sheet&index=4&md5=a42b04fa08c14d9ba1baa5702f9baa89), earned this award in recognition of the successful transition of his business operations to the cloud through Thryv Business Center. A former Thryv Marketing Services customer, Binkley transitioned to Thryv’s CRM, using its features to the fullest. In the process he has tripled his revenue, acquired 45+ Google reviews, added staff and has a new office in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “I work with numbers for a living and my revenue numbers don’t lie,” said Binkley. “Using Thryv Business Center has completely transformed how I run my business, from establishing an online presence to building efficiencies and increasing my responsiveness to customers. It’s been a game-changer.” \n\nSmall Business Productivity Award : Julie McDaniel, owner of [Artful Cakery by Julie](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.artfulcakery.com%2F&esheet=54155514&newsitemid=20241120494365&lan=en-US&anchor=Artful+Cakery+by+Julie&index=5&md5=a6756c59e2f6edb3cd31db51b050dbd5), earned this award for personifying the successful entrepreneurial experience. McDaniel credits her use of Thryv Business Center for growing her wedding and custom cake business by 100%, an incredible achievement that is even more notable in a challenging economy. McDaniel credits Thryv for getting her business organized by putting streamlined processes in place, from building an online presence to communicating with customers to accepting payments. “In the wedding cake business, your reputation is everything. With Thryv I now have a beautiful, professional website and a rapidly growing number of 5-star reviews. In 2023 I set a goal to get 20 wedding cake orders. Thanks to help from Thryv, I made 54 wedding cakes that year!” said McDaniel. \n\n**About the Thryv Small Business Excellence Awards**\n\nClient referrals drive nearly half of Thryv’s new business, making opportunities to share the value small businesses are receiving from the platform a powerful marketing tool for both the award winners and for Thryv.
