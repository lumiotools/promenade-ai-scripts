          "url": "https://rfindustries.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RFIL_Shareholder_Letter.pdf",
          "content": "Fellow Shareholders,\n2022 was an outstanding year for RF Industries and I am very proud of what our\nteam accomplished in transforming our company for sustained growth in the years\nahead. Even though we encountered the challenges of inflation, higher interest\nrates and lingering supply chain disruptions in 2022, we made significant headway in executing our five-\nyear strategy to shift our business to a higher margin value proposition while still growing our traditional\ncore business that generates strong cash flow.\nStrong Growth and Disciplined Execution Delivered Record Performance\nWe delivered record annual sales of $85.3 million, which was a 48% increase over last year and a high\nmark in our company’s history. Our gross profit margin expanded significantly throughout the year, with\na standout fourth quarter of 31%. Our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA also increased 143% to $6.6\nmillion.\nFully integrating our acquisition of Microlab was a highlight of 2022, and it made a strong impact on our\nannual results by contributing $15 million to product sales in the eight months following the transaction\nclose. Importantly, we financed this acquisition with cash and low-interest rate debt and with no dilution\nto our shareholders. Since acquiring Microlab, we have meaningfully paid down debt from our free cash\nflow. Managing capital well is a cornerstone of our business success and the completion of this\nacquisition was no exception.\nThese are impressive numbers for one year. But what’s equally impressive is that we’ve nearly\nquadrupled our size in five years – during a global pandemic, supply chain shortages and turbulent\nmarkets. Plus, our core business has grown organically for five consecutive years. These positive results\nreflected the disciplined execution of our plan including our strategic shift to higher value products and\nsolutions, our focus on managing expenses in an inflationary environment, and our commitment to\nbalancing organic growth with strategic acquisitions.\nBolstered Our Strong Customer Value Proposition Through Product Expansion\nOur customers count on us for quality products, inventory availability and speed. We are a highly\nreliable partner, and we make it easy for our customers to work with us. Our growth plan, whether it’s\norganic growth or through acquisitions, is to provide more of the bill of materials of interconnect\n1\nproducts for telecom, wireless and industrial customer applications. The continued expansion of our\nproduct offering allows customers to buy more from RF Industries across multiple product categories. It\nalso helps them reduce complexity and supply chain costs, while procuring the products they need to\ncomplete jobs quickly.\nOur RF family of products, including coaxial jumpers and fiber optic jumpers, is recognized for its\nconsistent high quality, and we are committed to innovating new products that meet the evolving and\nmission-critical needs of our customers. Our OptiFlexTM hybrid fiber solutions, for example, deliver the\noptimal solutions for wireless carriers seeking to upgrade existing infrastructure to 5G technology. This\nis just one of many products that have technical and intellectual property advantages that go well\nbeyond commoditized solutions. These systems were developed by Cables Unlimited, one of our two\nbrands that have qualified for the coveted Corning Assembly House Connection Gold Program, the\nhighest standard for fiberoptic cable production.\nOur Microlab acquisition was a big step forward in strengthening our signal distribution capabilities with\nproprietary patented technology. Microlab gives us access to distribution and deployment of in-building\nDAS (distributed antenna systems), wireless base stations and small cell networks. These product lines\nwill continue to produce significant project opportunities in stadiums and other key applications. Our\nSchrofftech brand of solutions offers energy efficient cooling/temperature control and filtration systems\nfor telecom shelters, outdoor enclosures and battery/power rooms. We also retrofit existing\ncommunications equipment infrastructure for capacity upgrades and thermal efficiencies through Direct\nAir Cooling (DAC) systems for wireless base stations and remote equipment shelters, supporting our\ncustomers’ green initiatives and energy cost savings programs by eliminating toxic chemicals and\ndecreasing air conditioning costs up to 75%. We are excited about the state-of-the-art solutions these\nproducts bring to the marketplace.\nPositioned To Deliver Long-Term Growth and Returns\nOur executive team is passionate about driving growth and creating value for all of our stakeholders. We\nare a mix of industry veterans, who bring valuable experience from larger companies in our space, and\ntrusted colleagues who have worked well together in the past. We also have a tremendous Board of\nDirectors, who are totally aligned with our strategy and are dedicated to strong corporate governance.\nFive out of six board members are independent, and they bring sophisticated financial expertise, risk\nmanagement and industry experience to the table.\nWe have a long runway for growth, and we will continue to deploy our strong cash flow from operations\nand capital resources prudently to fund growth initiatives that strengthen our competitive position and\ncreate value for our shareholders. At the end of 2022, we had built a healthy $28 million backlog that\ngave us some considerable visibility going into 2023. As I write this letter, we have already completed\nour first quarter of 2023 during which we encountered a shift in backlog deliveries. Most of the delayed\nshipments were related to the rollout of 4G and 5G technologies by wireless carriers. Like many\ncompanies everywhere, these customers are re-thinking their capital expenditure plans based on\npersistent inflation, higher cost of capital and an economic slowdown.\n2\nWe have been through these cycles before, most recently during the COVID pandemic, when wireless\ncarriers pulled back on certain infrastructure investments. That said, it does not diminish the need for\nwireless carriers to meet the connectivity and speed demands of their customers with 4G and 5G\nbuildouts. Granted, these delays are very frustrating, but we are confident that the carriers will resume\ntheir infrastructure deployments. They are already running from behind and their businesses models\nrequire them to stay on the sharp edge of competition or lose valuable customers. We are now slowly\nstarting to see project-related orders flow through and expect them to accelerate in the second half of\n2023.\nQuarter to quarter, our business has always been lumpy—it’s the nature of projects and ordering and\nfulfillment patterns. Regardless, RF Industries serves all Tier-1 wireless carriers, and this presents a\nsignificant opportunity to capture greater market share and to realize our vision of being at the forefront\nof the wireless industry.\nAs mentioned earlier, we are very excited about the potential of our higher-value products, such as\nOptiflexTM hybrid fiber, Direct Air Cooling (DAC) and integrated small cell shrouds for the wireless\nbuildout. DAC has broad applications across many industries and both Small Cell and DAC products are\nnext-generation technology products with compelling value propositions.\nWe also will continue to improve margins by reducing redundancies during 2023. The consolidation of\nour two West Coast facilities into a single San Diego location will be completed in early Summer and we\nare accelerating our plan to consolidate some of our East Coast operations in New Jersey. This will allow\nus to take advantage of economies of scale, reduce overhead costs and better serve our East Coast\ncustomers. With these moves, we will be well positioned to continue providing the high-quality products\nand services our customers expect from us while also improving overall profitability.\nFinally, we recently conducted research to understand more about the relationship customers have with\nour products and the relative importance of our RF family of brands. Based on our findings, we will\nintroduce a new brand architecture this year that will unify our house of brands and create touch points\nfor our customers to connect with each brand to the RF reputation for quality products and service. This\nwill evolve our go-to-market strategy as we enter new adjacencies and industries.\nI am both excited and confident in our ability to continue creating value for our shareholders well into\nthe future, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank our employees for their hard work and\ndedication. Fiscal `22 was a transformative year for RF Industries, and we are just beginning to scratch\nthe surface of what is to come.\nSincerely,\nRobert Dawson\nPresident and CEO\n3"

Yet the area’s densely populated\ncommunities and famous boardwalk mean small cells must be strategically placed to increase wireless\ncapacity and coverage in an effective, cost-efficient way. Munisite Networks, which builds and operates\nmulti-tenant, multi-use, neutral-host infrastructure for wireless carriers, IoT companies and public\nentities, was engaged by a Tier 1 wireless carrier to deploy its millimeter wave spectrum at optimal\nlocations for small cell equipment without creating visual clutter. Munisite turned to RFI for a solution.\nThe Solution:\n• True RF transparency enables exceptional small cell performance with no visual clutter.\n• With RF Industries’ TruField pole-top concealment shrouds, Munisite was able to efficiently deploy and\nconceal the wireless carrier’s small cell equipment at dozens of locations along the Jersey Shore while\nensuring outstanding 5G performance.\n• TruField concealment shrouds are designed to support multiple tenants with no signal degradation. This\nimproved wireless services in the busy Jersey Shore area without a proliferation of unsightly equipment.\n13 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nDAC Customer Case Study – Montauk Point Lighthouse\nHistoric lighthouse once again home to Fresnel lens – A fully monitored environmental\ncontrol system from RF Industries optimizes airflow, keeps salt and moisture out\n14 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nCase Study Continued\nThe Problem:\nMontauk Point Lighthouse has been weathering the harsh, seaside conditions at the tip of Long Island,\nNew York, since it was completed in 1796. By 2019, increasing condensation and corrosive sale moisture\nwas causing significant issues that created risks to the tower structure. The underlying masonry issues\nand leaks were repaired and a commercial-grade dehumidifier and monitoring system was installed. As\nrestoration of the tower neared completion, the possibility arose to allow the 3-1/2 order antique\nFresnel lens that served the lighthouse between 1903 and 1987 to be reinstalled in the lantern room.\nUnfortunately, the off the-shelf dehumidifier and monitoring system couldn’t deliver the reliable\nperformance needed to adequately protect the 110.5-foottall Lighthouse and allow the Fresnel lens to be\nreinstalled. The Montauk Point Lighthouse staff turned to RFI for a solution.\nThe Solution:\n• Schrofftech, a division of RF Industries, installed its Direct Air Cooling (DAC) environmental control\nsystem combined with AVTECH’s Room Alert environmental monitoring solution to resolve the\nLighthouse’s humidity challenges.\n• A virtual sensor tracks critical environment conditions and data and can alert lighthouse staff if\nconditions exceed appropriate temperature and humidity levels to protect the antique Fresnel lens.\n15 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nOur Brands\n16 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nMarket Overview\n© RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential\nTarget Markets\nOur Products Help Make Wireless Work and Enable Many Industrial Applications\nWireless Connectivity\nCarrier Infrastructure Distributed Antenna Systems Public Safety\nIndustrial and Other Communications\nTelecom and Networking Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Testing\nTransportation Oil and Gas Land Mobile Radio\n18 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nMarket Opportunity\nLarge and highly fragmented markets including wireless carrier builds\n• 5G Market estimated at ~$200B by 2030 with 48% CAGR from 2022 to 2030\n• 5G build is expected to provide a long-term opportunity of 15-20 years\n• Distributed Antenna Systems Market = $8B growing to $18B in 2026\n• Small Cell = 80% of future infrastructure deployments will be small cells\n“5G will transform industries and should be viewed as a business strategy for all.”\n- Qualcomm\n19 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential Source: CTIA, US Congress, RFIL Company Estimates www.rfindustries.com\nMarket Influence and Sales Breakout\nOur job is to influence end customer purchases with quality products and high touch service\nInfluence\nProducts Channel End Customer\nDistribution\n60%\nDistributors\nCarriers\nNeutral Hosts\nDirect to\nNeutral Hosts\nCarrier/OEM\nIntegrators\n40%\nManufacturers Manufacturers\n20 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nDistribution Partners & Sample End User Customers\nDistribution Partners Sample Customers\n21 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nCompelling Customer Value Proposition\nSpeed of delivery requires deep understanding of customer inventory needs; and\n•\nFast ability to manage inventory\nFaster lead times than larger competitors\n•\nFlexible Customized product options and solutions\n•\nReliable Consistent supplier of superior products at competitive prices\n•\nHigh quality products; ISO 9001 Certified; Corning Gold House Certified,\n•\nHigh Quality\nAS9100 Certified\nCustomer Mix Customers include all Tier 1 carriers and high percentage of repeat customers\n•\nEnabling key applications to work through competitively priced, high-quality products\nresults in high ROIC for customers\n22 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nGrowth Strategy\n© RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential\nOrganic Growth + Strategic M&A = Growth Strategy\nOrganic Growth Strategic M&A\nProprietary product offerings\nSteady core product line growth\nand IP\nExpand and diversify market and\nEnter new market segments\ncustomer base\nExpand product offering Cross selling opportunities\nLeverage strong RFIL reputation New distribution channels\nEnhance addressable market, technology, competitive position and\ncreate synergies and efficiencies\n24 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nTrack Record of Strategic Acquisitions\n2022 2019 2019\n• $16M revenue, $3.7 M adjusted EBITDA; • $6M revenue • $8.7M revenue; immediately accretive;\n$24M cash transaction cash transaction\n• In-demand product categories\n• Designs and manufactures high- • Connectivity solutions for\n‒ Energy-efficient Direct Air Cooling(DAC)\nperformance radio frequency and telecommunications and data\nsystem for wireless base stations and\nmicrowave products enabling signal remote equipment shelters that decrease communications distributors\ndistribution and deployment of venue telecom carrier’s air conditioning costs up to\n75% • New revenue opportunities from\nand in-building DAS, wireless base\nenhanced small cell product offering\nstations and small cell networks ‒ Family of custom designed, pole-ready 5G\nsmall cell integrated enclosures that for wireless carrier market\n• Significant growth opportunities in improve aesthetics and reduce small cell\nsmall cell and DAS markets plus installation time from days to hour\noperating synergies\n25 © RF Industries 2024 | Proprietary & Confidential www.rfindustries.com\nExperienced Management Team\nRobert Dawson, Chief Executive Officer, Director - Joined RF Industries as CEO in 2017 and appointed\nto the Board in 2018.

We believe these financial measures provide useful information to investors with\nwhich to analyze our operating trends and performance.\nIn computing Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, which\nrepresents non-cash charges for the fair value of stock options and other non-cash awards granted to employees, non-cash and other\nlease charges, and severance. For Adjusted EBITDA we also exclude depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income\ntaxes. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can\nimpact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash\nexpense and non-recurring costs and expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and\nthose of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating\nour own core business operating results over different periods of time.\nOur Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to\nthat provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results\ndifferently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items.
