(NASDAQ:MRNA) today announced Health Canada has approved mRESVIA™ (Respiratory Syncytial Virus mRNA vaccine) for active immunization for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in adults 60 years of age and older.1\n\n\"Today's approval is an example of how our mRNA platform can help address significant public health challenges like RSV,\" said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna. \"As our second product approved by Health Canada, mRESVIA underscores our commitment to leveraging mRNA technology to protect vulnerable populations and contribute to a healthier future for Canadians.\" \n\nmRESVIA is the only RSV vaccine available in a pre-filled syringe. This format offers a convenient, ready-to-use formulation that simplifies the process of administering the vaccine, saving healthcare professionals time and reducing the risk of administrative errors. Supply of mRESVIA is anticipated in Canada in early 2025. \n\nThe National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends vaccination against RSV for people in Canada aged 75 years and older, as well as those aged 60 years and older who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities. Community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older are recommended for RSV vaccination as an individual decision following consultation with their healthcare provider.2\n\n\"With Health Canada's approval of mRESVIA for Canadians aged 60 and older, we are proud to bring the first-ever mRNA vaccine against RSV to Canadians in a convenient and efficient pre-filled syringe format,\" said Stefan Raos, General Manager at Moderna in Canada. \"This milestone highlights the importance of vaccination for older adults, who face heightened risks from RSV, and reinforces our dedication to advancing mRNA innovation for meaningful public health impact.\" \n\nHealth Canada's approval is based on data from the Phase 3 clinical trial [ConquerRSV](https://pr.report/41rk), a global study conducted in approximately 37,000 adults aged 60 years and older in 22 countries. No serious safety concerns were identified in the Phase 3 trial. Moderna continues to file for mRESVIA marketing authorizations worldwide. \n\n**About mRESVIA™**\n\nmRESVIA is an RSV vaccine that consists of an mRNA sequence encoding RSV glycoprotein F stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The F glycoprotein is expressed on the surface of the virus and is required for infection by helping the virus to enter host cells. The prefusion conformation of the F protein is a significant target of potent neutralizing antibodies and is highly conserved across both RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes. The vaccine uses the same lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. \n\n**About Moderna**\n\nModerna is a leader in the creation of the field of mRNA medicine. Through the advancement of mRNA technology, Moderna is reimagining how medicines are made and transforming how we treat and prevent disease for everyone. By working at the intersection of science, technology and health for more than a decade, the company has developed medicines at unprecedented speed and efficiency, including one of the earliest and most effective COVID-19 vaccines. \n\nModerna's mRNA platform has enabled the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and autoimmune diseases. With a unique culture and a global team driven by Moderna values and mindsets to responsibly change the future of human health, Moderna strives to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines.

(NASDAQ:MRNA) today reported\nfinancial results and provided business updates for the third quarter of 2024.\n“During the third quarter, we focused on execution with the launch of our updated COVID-19 and RSV\nvaccines in markets across the globe. I am pleased with the cost efficiency we achieved in the quarter,\ntracking ahead of where we planned to be at this time,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer\nof Moderna. “Looking into the fourth quarter and preparing for 2025, we remain focused on driving\nsales growth, delivering 10 product approvals over the next three years, and continuing to reduce our\ncost structure.\"\nRecent progress includes:\nCommercial Updates\nCOVID-19: The Company reported $1.8 billion in Spikevax® sales in the third quarter of 2024, which\nincludes $1.2 billion of U.S. sales and $0.6 billion of international sales.\nModerna's updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has been approved in major markets worldwide. In the\nU.S., the Company was ready for an earlier COVID vaccine approval compared to the prior season, with\ntimely shipments to all channels across the U.S. healthcare system. The approval timing has driven an\nearlier uptake in the retail channel, where Moderna has 40% market share season to date.1\nThe Company continues to focus on public health efforts to drive vaccination rates globally. Moderna\nhas undertaken marketing and awareness campaigns to educate consumers and activate the medical\ncommunity. The recent recommendation of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\n(ACIP) of additional doses for older adults and high-risk populations is supportive of vaccination uptake.\n1 Source: Based on information licensed from IQVIA: IQVIA RAPID Weekly Audit for August-October 2024, reflecting\nestimates of real-world activity. All rights reserved.\n1\nRSV: The Company reported $10 million in mRESVIA® sales in the third quarter of 2024. Sales were\nlower than anticipated, resulting from the approval and recommendation of mRESVIA later in the\ncontracting season, when many customers had completed their orders. Moderna's RSV vaccine has\nbeen approved in the U.S., EU, Norway, Iceland and Qatar.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nRevenue: Total revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.9 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in the\nsame period in 2023. Net product sales for the third quarter of 2024 reached $1.8 billion, reflecting a\n4% year-over-year increase. This growth was primarily driven by higher sales in the U.S. market,\nfollowing the earlier launch of the updated COVID-19 vaccine. With FDA approval granted three weeks\nearlier than in the previous year, the Company was able to meet demand more effectively. International\nsales were lower compared to the same period in 2023, when sales benefited from the fulfillment of\norders deferred from 2022. Additionally, the Company commenced sales of its RSV vaccine during the\nthird quarter of 2024. RSV vaccine sales were $10 million in the quarter.\nCost of Sales: Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2024 was $514 million, which included third-party\nroyalties of $92 million, inventory write-downs of $214 million, and unutilized manufacturing capacity\nand wind-down costs of $27 million. Compared to the same period in 2023, the cost of sales decreased\nby $1.7 billion, or 77%. Cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales was 28% for the third quarter\nof 2024, down from 128% in the third quarter of 2023. The significant decrease in both cost of sales\nand cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales was primarily due to reductions in inventory\nwrite-downs and unutilized manufacturing capacity, and productivity improvements.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of\n2024 decreased by 2% to $1.1 billion, compared to the third quarter in 2023. The reduction was mainly\ndue to lower clinical development and manufacturing expenses, driven by decreased spending on\nclinical trials and productivity improvements. This decrease was partially offset by the cost of\npurchasing a priority review voucher.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses for the\nthird quarter of 2024 decreased by 36% to $281 million, compared to the third quarter in 2023. This\nreduction was driven by the Company's continued focus on cost management and operational\nefficiencies achieved through prior investments in foundational capabilities. These efficiencies\nsignificantly reduced reliance on external consultants and purchased services. The Company remains\ncommitted to investing in digital and commercial capabilities and has increased its emphasis on\nbuilding and utilizing AI technologies to further streamline operations and enhance productivity.\n2\nIncome Taxes: The Company recognized an income tax expense of $8 million for the third quarter of\n2024, compared to $1.7 billion in the same period last year. The significant decrease was primarily due\nto the establishment of a $1.7 billion valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of\n2023. This valuation allowance has been applied consistently since its initial recognition in the third\nquarter of 2023.\nNet Income (Loss): Net income was $13 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of\n$(3.6) billion for the third quarter of 2023.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share: Earnings per share was $0.03 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to loss\nper share of $(9.53) for the third quarter of 2023.\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September 30, 2024, were $9.2 billion,\ncompared to $10.8 billion as of June 30, 2024. The decrease in the cash position during the third\nquarter of 2024 was largely attributable to research and development expenses and operating\nactivities.\n2024 Financial Framework\nNet Sales: The Company reiterates its 2024 expected net product sales of $3.0 to $3.5 billion from its\nrespiratory franchise.\nCost of Sales: Cost of sales is now expected to be in the range of 40-45% of product sales for the year\n(previously 40-50%).\nResearch and Development Expenses: Full-year 2024 research and development expenses are now\nanticipated to be in the range of $4.6 to $4.7 billion (previously $4.8 billion).\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024\nare projected to be approximately $1.2 billion.\nIncome Taxes: The Company continues to expect its full-year tax expense to be negligible.\nCapital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for 2024 are now expected to be approximately $1.2 billion\n(previously ~$0.9 billion). The updated estimate includes the purchase of the Norwood, MA, campus\nfor ~$0.4 billion.\nCash and Investments: Year-end cash and investments for 2024 are projected to be approximately $9\nbillion.\nRecent Progress and Upcoming Late-Stage Pipeline Milestones\n3\nThe Company remains focused on a prioritized research and development portfolio, delivering on 10\nproduct approvals over the next three years.\nRespiratory vaccines:\n• Next-generation COVID-19 vaccine: Moderna shared positive Phase 3 vaccine efficacy and\nimmunogenicity data for its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283) at its R&D Day\nevent in September 2024.\n• Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine: Moderna shared positive Phase 3 data for its vaccine\nagainst RSV (mRNA-1345) in high-risk adults aged 18-59 at its 2024 R&D Day event.\n• Seasonal flu + COVID vaccine: Moderna shared positive Phase 3 immunogenicity data for its\nflu/COVID combination vaccine at its 2024 R&D Day event.\n• Seasonal flu vaccine: The Company has initiated a Phase 3 efficacy study (P304) for its seasonal\nflu vaccine (mRNA-1010), which has demonstrated consistently acceptable safety and\ntolerability across three previous Phase 3 trials.\n• Moderna is on track to file in 2024 for approval of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine\n(mRNA-1283) and RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for high-risk adults aged 18-59; the Company\nexpects to communicate the PDUFA date for each of these programs when it is confirmed.\nModerna intends to use priority review vouchers for mRNA-1283 and mRNA-1345 for high-\nrisk adults aged 18-59. For its flu/COVID combination vaccine (mRNA-1083), the Company\nintends to file in 2024, subject to ongoing discussions with the U.S. FDA, and has decided not\nto use a priority review voucher.\nLatent and other vaccines:\n• Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine: Moderna expects to have accrued the 81 cases necessary to\ntrigger the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 vaccine efficacy study of its CMV vaccine\ncandidate (mRNA-1647) by the end of 2024. If the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)\nrecommends unblinding at the first interim analysis, the Company intends to share the results.\n• Norovirus vaccine: Moderna's trivalent vaccine candidate for the prevention of norovirus\n(mRNA-1403) advanced into a pivotal Phase 3 randomized clinical trial evaluating its efficacy,\nsafety and immunogenicity.\nOncology therapeutics:\n4\n• Individualized Neoantigen Therapy (INT): Moderna and Merck initiated a Phase 3 study\nevaluating adjuvant INT (mRNA-4157) in combination with KEYTRUDA® after neoadjuvant\nKEYTRUDA and chemotherapy in patients with certain types of resected non-small cell lung\ncancer. This is the third Phase 3 trial for the investigational INT focused on earlier stages of\ncancer.\nRare disease therapeutics:\n• Propionic acidemia (PA) therapeutic: In an ongoing Phase 1/2 study designed to evaluate safety\nand pharmacology in trial participants with PA, Moderna's investigational therapeutic (mRNA-\n3927) was generally well-tolerated to date with no events meeting protocol-defined dose-\nlimiting toxicity criteria. Early results suggest potential decreases in annualized metabolic\ndecompensation event (MDE) frequency compared to pre-treatment, and the majority of\npatients have elected to continue on the open label extension study. The Company intends to\nbegin generating pivotal trial data in 2024.\n• Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) therapeutic: Moderna's investigational therapeutic for MMA\n(mRNA-3705) has been selected by the U.S. FDA for the Support for Clinical Trials Advancing\nRare Disease Therapeutics (START) pilot program. The FDA and Moderna have agreed on the\npivotal study design. The Company expects to start a pivotal study in the first half of 2025.\nModerna Corporate Updates\n• Expanded the Moderna Executive Committee:\n◦ Moderna President Stephen Hoge, M.D., has taken on an expanded role, adding new\nresponsibilities overseeing Moderna’s commercial organization.

Description of the Business\nModerna, Inc. (collectively, with its consolidated subsidiaries, any of Moderna, we, us, our or the Company) is a biotechnology company advancing a new\nclass of medicines made of messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted\nproteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. Our platform builds on continuous advances in\nbasic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new\ndevelopment candidates. We are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology, rare diseases and autoimmune diseases,\nindependently and with our strategic collaborators.\nOur COVID-19 vaccine is our first commercial product and is marketed, where approved, under the name Spikevax®. Our original vaccine, mRNA-1273,\ntargeted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, and we have leveraged our mRNA platform to rapidly adapt our vaccine to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains to\nprovide protection as the virus evolves and regulatory guidance is updated.\nIn May 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mRESVIA® (mRNA-1345), our mRNA respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, to\nprotect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The approval was granted under a breakthrough therapy\ndesignation and marks the second approved mRNA product from Moderna.\nWe have a diverse and extensive development pipeline of 36 development candidates across our 45 development programs, of which 42 are in clinical studies\ncurrently.\n2. Summary of Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Standards\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that accompany these notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (GAAP) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial reporting,\nconsistent in all material respects with those applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Form 10-K). Any\nreference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as found in\nthe Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) and Accounting Standards Update (ASU) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). This report\nshould be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include Moderna, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated\nin consolidation. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 are consistent with those described in our 2023 Form 10-K. The only exception pertains to the policy related to research and\ndevelopment funding. We entered into a research and development funding arrangement in the first quarter of 2024. Please refer to Note 5 for further details\nregarding this policy. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to\nbe expected for the full fiscal year or future operating periods. We anticipate seasonal fluctuations in demand for our COVID-19 and recently approved RSV\nvaccines, with higher sales expected during the fall and winter seasons.\nUse of Estimates\nWe have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. We\nbase our estimates on historical experience and various relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which\nform the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in our estimates are recorded in the financial\nresults of the period in which the new information becomes available. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.\n11\nTable of Contents\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and other comprehensive income/loss for the period. Other comprehensive income/loss consists of\nunrealized gains/losses on our investments, derivatives designated as hedging instruments, and foreign currency translation, as well as, pension and\npostretirement obligation adjustments. Total comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented has been disclosed in the condensed consolidated statements\nof comprehensive loss.\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\nUnrealized Gains on\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Pension and Gains on Foreign Currency\nSecurities Postretirement Benefits Translation Total\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, balance at December 31,\n2023 $ (114) $ (9) $ — $ (123)\nOther comprehensive income 22 — — 22\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, balance at March 31,\n2024 (92) (9) — (101)\nOther comprehensive income 30 — — 30\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss, balance at June 30, 2024 (62) (9) — (71)\nOther comprehensive income 74 — 8 82\nAccumulated other comprehensive income, balance at September\n30, 2024 $ 12 $ (9) $ 8 $ 11\nRestricted Cash\nWe include our restricted cash balance in the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reconciliation of operating, investing and financing activities in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of\nthe same such amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,644 $ 2,932\nRestricted cash(1) — 17\nRestricted cash, non-current(2) 3 4\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash shown in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows $ 1,647 $ 2,953\n_______\n(1)Included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Included in other non-current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies and adopted by us as of the specified effective\ndate. Except as noted below, we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU\nbroadens the disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n(CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard also requires entities to disclose, on an interim and annual basis,\nthe amount and description, including the nature and type, of the other segment items. Additionally, entities are required to disclose the title and position of the\nindividual identified as\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how\nto allocate resources. These enhanced disclosure obligations apply to entities that operate with one reportable segment as well. ASU 2023-07 is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis. Early\nadoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact that this new accounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires\ndisaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The standard\nrequires entities to disclose federal, state, and foreign income taxes in their rate reconciliation tables and elaborate on reconciling items that exceed a\nquantitative threshold. Additionally, it requires an annual disclosure of income taxes paid, net of refunds, categorized by jurisdiction based on a quantitative\nthreshold. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU will result\nin the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently assessing the impact that this new\naccounting standard will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n3. Net Product Sales\nNet product sales by customer geographic location were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 1,215 $ 913 $ 1,477 $ 916\nEurope 281 103 281 739\nRest of world 324 741 413 2,223\nTotal $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\nNet product sales by product were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCOVID-19 $ 1,810 $ 1,757 $ 2,161 $ 3,878\nRSV 10 — 10 —\nTotal $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have two commercial products authorized for use, our COVID-19 vaccine and our RSV vaccine. The RSV vaccine was\napproved by the FDA in May 2024 for adults aged 60 years and older and we commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024.\nPrior to the third quarter of 2023, we sold our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations. The\nagreements and related amendments with these entities generally do not include variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates or returns. Certain of these\nagreements entitle us to upfront deposits for our COVID-19 vaccine supply, initially recorded as deferred revenue.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had deferred revenue of $443 million and $613 million, respectively, related to customer deposits for\nour COVID-19 vaccine. We expect $361 million of our deferred revenue related to customer deposits as of September 30, 2024 to be realized in less than one\nyear. Timing of product delivery and manufacturing, and receipt of marketing approval for the applicable COVID-19 vaccine will determine the period in\nwhich product sales are recognized.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. commercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign\ngovernments and international organizations. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. In the U.S., our COVID-19 and RSV\nvaccines are sold primarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. Wholesalers and distributors\ntypically do not make upfront payments to us.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNet product sales are recognized net of estimated wholesaler chargebacks, invoice discounts for prompt payments and pre-orders, provisions for sales returns\nand government rebates, and other related deductions.\nThe following table summarizes product sales provision for the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross product sales $ 2,964 $ 2,420 $ 3,377 $ 4,541\nProduct sales provision:\nWholesaler chargebacks, discounts and fees (1,053) (479) (1,053) (479)\nReturns, rebates and other fees (91) (184) (153) (184)\nTotal product sales provision(1) $ (1,144) $ (663) $ (1,206) $ (663)\nNet product sales $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\n_______\n(1)Includes an adjustment of approximately $140 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a reduction in prior period provision estimates, primarily related\nto returns for the previous COVID-19 vaccine season that closed during the quarter.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to product sales provision recorded as accrued liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\n(in millions):\nReturns and other fees\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (556)\nProvision related to sales made in 2024 (308)\nProvision related to sales made in prior periods(1) 155\nPayments and returns related to sales made in current period 42\nPayments and returns related to sales made in prior year 264\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (403)\n_______\n(1)Primarily reflecting a reduction in prior period return estimates for the previous COVID-19 vaccine season that closed during the quarter.\n4. Other Revenue\nThe following table summarizes other revenue for the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGrant revenue $ 7 $ 44 $ 27 $ 96\nCollaboration revenue 28 30 35 63\nLicensing and royalty revenue 7 — 37 —\nTotal other revenue $ 42 $ 74 $ 99 $ 159\nGrant Revenue\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a division of the Administration\nfor Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), for an award of up to $483 million to\naccelerate development of mRNA-1273. The agreement has been subsequently amended to provide for additional commitments to support various late-stage\nclinical development efforts of our original COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, including a 30,000 participant Phase 3 study, pediatric clinical trials, adolescent\nclinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies. The maximum award from BARDA, inclusive of all amendments, was approximately $1.8 billion. All contract\noptions have been exercised. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining available funding, net of revenue earned was $70 million.\n14\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2024, we were awarded up to $176 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV), funded by BARDA, to accelerate the\ndevelopment of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines. The project award will support the late-stage development of an mRNA-based vaccine to enable\nthe licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine against the H5 influenza virus. This subtype of the influenza virus causes a highly infectious and severe disease in\nbirds known as avian influenza and poses a risk of spillover into the human population. The agreement also includes additional options to prepare for and\naccelerate responses to future public health threats. We had not recognized any revenue under this agreement as of September 30, 2024.\nLicensing and Royalty Revenue\nIn April 2024, we entered a non-exclusive out-licensing agreement with a pharmaceutical company based in Japan for mRNA COVID-19-related intellectual\nproperty for the territory of Japan. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50 million, which included a $20 million prepayment\ncreditable against future royalties. Additionally, we are entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on the net sales of the company’s COVID-19 product.\nUpon execution of the agreement, we recognized $30 million of the upfront payment as other revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe remaining $20 million was recorded as deferred revenue in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the third quarter of 2024, we began recognizing\nroyalty revenue by amortizing the deferred revenue as the underlying sales occurred.\n5. Collaboration Agreements and Research and Development Funding Arrangement\nMerck\nIn June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement for the development and commercialization of personalized mRNA cancer vaccines (also\nknown as individualized neoantigen therapy, or INT) with Merck. This agreement was subsequently amended and restated in 2018. Our role in this strategic\nalliance involves identifying genetic mutations in a particular patient’s tumor cells, synthesizing mRNA for these mutations, encapsulating the mRNA in one of\nour proprietary lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), and administering a unique mRNA INT to each patient. Each INT is designed to specifically activate the patient’s\nimmune system against her or his own cancer cells.\nIn September 2022, Merck exercised its option for INT, including mRNA-4157, pursuant to the terms of the agreement and in October 2022 paid us an option\nexercise fee of $250 million. Following this exercise, the Merck Participation Term commenced. Pursuant to the agreement, we and Merck have agreed to\ncollaborate on further development and commercialization of INT, with costs and any profits or losses to be shared equally on a worldwide basis.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized expenses, net of Merck's reimbursements, of $109 million and $280 million,\nrespectively, related to the INT collaboration under the Merck Participation Term. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, these expenses\nwere $53 million and $122 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net cost recovery for capital expenditures was $25 million and $82 million,\nrespectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the net cost recovery for capital expenditures was $16 million and $34 million,\nrespectively. These amounts were applied to reduce the capitalized cost of the assets.\nWe have other collaborative and licensing arrangements that we do not consider to be individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to these\nagreements, we may be required to make upfront payments and payments upon achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones,\nwhich in the aggregate could be significant. Future milestone payments, if any, will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements when the\ncorresponding events have occurred. In addition, we may be required to pay significant royalties on future sales if products related to these arrangements are\ncommercialized.\nDevelopment and Commercialization Funding Arrangement with Blackstone Life Sciences (Blackstone)\nIn March 2024, we entered into a development and commercialization funding arrangement with Blackstone, under which Blackstone has committed to\nproviding up to $750 million in funding to us. This funding supports the development of our investigational mRNA-based influenza vaccine. Contingent upon\nregulatory approval in the U.S. and only if the approval is dependent on data from the funded activities, Blackstone will be entitled to receive low single-digit\npercentage royalties and up to $750 million in sales milestone payments. These payments are based on net sales of our future influenza and combination\nvaccines, with sales milestone payments contingent upon achieving specified cumulative net sales targets.\n15\nTable of Contents\nGiven the substantive transfer of financial risk to Blackstone, we account for this arrangement as an obligation to conduct research and development activities.\nThe funding is recognized as a reduction to the expenses of our mRNA-based influenza program. This reduction is recognized proportionally as the related\ncosts are incurred, based on an input method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded research and development expense\nreductions of $30 million and $35 million, respectively.\n6. Financial Instruments\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities by significant investment category as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023 (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNon-\nCash and Current Current\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Cash Marketable Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value Equivalents Securities Securities\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,644 $ — $ — $ 1,644 $ 1,644 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale:\nCertificates of deposit 27 — — 27 — 27 —\nU.S. treasury bills 538 1 — 539 — 539 —\nU.S. treasury notes 3,234 7 (15) 3,226 — 2,244 982\nCorporate debt securities 3,625 7 (18) 3,614 — 2,269 1,345\nGovernment debt securities 153 — (1) 152 — 144 8\nTotal $ 9,221 $ 15 $ (34) $ 9,202 $ 1,644 $ 5,223 $ 2,335\nDecember 31, 2023\nNon-\nCash and Current Current\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated Cash Marketable Marketable\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value Equivalents Securities Securities\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,907 $ — $ — $ 2,907 $ 2,907 $ — $ —\nAvailable-for-sale:\nCertificates of deposit 27 — — 27 — 27 —\nU.S. treasury bills 807 — — 807 — 807 —\nU.S. treasury notes 4,407 3 (67) 4,343 — 2,664 1,679\nCorporate debt securities 5,067 3 (81) 4,989 — 2,082 2,907\nGovernment debt securities 211 — (3) 208 — 117 91\nTotal $ 13,426 $ 6 $ (151) $ 13,281 $ 2,907 $ 5,697 $ 4,677\n16\nTable of Contents\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as\nfollows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAmortized Estimated\nCost Fair Value\nDue in one year or less $ 5,240 $ 5,223\nDue after one year through five years 2,337 2,335\nTotal $ 7,577 $ 7,558\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Estimated\nCost Fair Value\nDue in one year or less $ 5,751 $ 5,697\nDue after one year through five years 4,768 4,677\nTotal $ 10,519 $ 10,374\nIn accordance with our investment policy, we place investments in investment grade securities with high credit quality issuers, and generally limit the amount\nof credit exposure to any one issuer. We evaluate securities for impairment at the end of each reporting period. Impairment is evaluated considering numerous\nfactors, and their relative significance varies depending on the situation. Factors considered include whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost\nbasis is due to credit-related factors or non-credit-related factors, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold\nthe investment to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss),\nnet of applicable taxes. A credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. We did not\nrecognize any impairment charges related to available-for-sale securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We did not record\nany credit-related allowance for available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the amount of gross unrealized losses and the estimated fair value for our available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss\nposition by the length of time the securities have been in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or More Total\nGross Gross Gross\nUnrealized Estimated Fair Unrealized Estimated Fair Unrealized Estimated Fair\nLosses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nAs of September 30, 2024:\nU.S. treasury bills $ — $ 219 $ — $ — $ — $ 219\nU.S. treasury notes — 300 (15) 1,581 (15) 1,881\nCorporate debt securities (1) 368 (18) 1,921 (19) 2,289\nGovernment debt securities — — — 76 — 76\nTotal $ (1) $ 887 $ (33) $ 3,578 $ (34) $ 4,465\nAs of December 31, 2023:\nU.S. treasury bills $ — $ 25 $ — $ — $ — $ 25\nU.S. treasury notes (3) 774 (64) 2,983 (67) 3,757\nCorporate debt securities (1) 562 (79) 3,518 (80) 4,080\nGovernment debt securities — 8 (4) 143 (4) 151\nTotal $ (4) $ 1,369 $ (147) $ 6,644 $ (151) $ 8,013\n17\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we held 233 and 392 available-for-sale securities, respectively, out of our total investment portfolio that\nwere in a continuous unrealized loss position. We neither intend to sell these investments, nor do we believe that we are more-likely-than-not to conclude we\nwill have to sell them before recovery of their carrying values. We also believe that we will be able to collect both principal and interest amounts due to us at\nmaturity.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and\nliabilities:\n• Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\n• Level 2: Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable,\neither directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; or\n• Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by\nlittle or no market activity).\nThe following tables summarize our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n(in millions):\nFair Value Measurement Using\nFair value at September\n30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 530 $ 530 $ —\nCertificates of deposit 27 — 27\nU.S. treasury bills 1,164 — 1,164\nU.S. treasury notes 3,226 — 3,226\nCorporate debt securities 3,975 — 3,975\nGovernment debt securities 152 — 152\nEquity investments(1) 23 23 —\nTotal $ 9,097 $ 553 $ 8,544\nLiabilities:\nDerivative instruments $ 2 $ — $ 2\nFair Value Measurement Using\nFair value at December\n31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 1,572 $ 1,572 $ —\nCertificates of deposit 27 — 27\nU.S. treasury bills 1,246 — 1,246\nU.S. treasury notes 4,343 — 4,343\nCorporate debt securities 5,480 — 5,480\nGovernment debt securities 208 — 208\nEquity Investments(1) 24 24 —\nDerivative instruments 4 — 4\nTotal $ 12,904 $ 1,596 $ 11,308\nLiabilities:\nDerivative instruments $ 9 $ — $ 9\n18\nTable of Contents\n_______\n(1)Investments in publicly traded equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded at quoted market prices for identical securities, with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other expense, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and did not\nhave any Level 3 financial assets or financial liabilities.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized net losses of $8 million and $43 million, respectively, on equity investments from\nchanges in fair value of the securities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized net losses of $33 million and $16 million,\nrespectively, on equity investments from changes in fair value of the securities.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had $42 million in equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which were recorded within other\nnon-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and excluded from the fair value measurement tables above. These investments became publicly traded\nduring the first quarter of 2024 and were recorded at their quoted market price in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024.\n7. Inventory\nInventory as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consisted of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nRaw materials $ 171 $ 163\nWork in progress 95 15\nFinished goods 146 24\nTotal inventory $ 412 $ 202\nInventory, non-current(1) $ 65 $ 170\n_______\n(1)Consisted of raw materials with an anticipated consumption beyond one year. Inventory, non-current is included in other non-current assets in the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nInventory write-downs as a result of excess, obsolescence, scrap or other reasons, and losses on firm purchase commitments are recorded as a component of\ncost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, inventory write-downs were\n$214 million and $302 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, inventory write-downs were $1.3 billion and\n$1.9 billion, respectively. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, losses on firm purchase commitments were $21 million. For the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, losses on firm purchase commitments were zero and $141 million, respectively. Inventory write-downs were\nmainly related to obsolete inventory due to inventory in excess of expected demand and shelf-life expiration. Losses on firm purchase commitments were\nprimarily related to excess raw material purchase commitments that will expire before the anticipated consumption of those raw materials. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued liability for losses on firm future purchase commitments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets was\n$21 million and $79 million, respectively.\nIn May 2024, the FDA approved our RSV vaccine for adults aged 60 years and older, and we began to capitalize RSV vaccine inventory. As of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, we had inventory on hand of $477 million and $372 million, respectively, inclusive of inventory for our COVID-19 and RSV\nvaccines. Our raw materials and work-in-progress inventory have variable shelf lives. We expect that the majority of this inventory will be consumed over the\nnext three years. The shelf life of our COVID-19 vaccine product ranges from nine to twelve months. The shelf life of our RSV vaccine is 18 months.\n19\nTable of Contents\nPre-launch Inventory\nConsistent with guidance from regulators, we have updated our COVID-19 vaccine to target the KP.2 and JN.1 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and are\nprepared to meet the anticipated 2024-2025 season demand. We commenced manufacturing and capitalizing pre-launch inventory costs related to both KP.2\nand JN.1 strains in the first half of 2024, prior to regulatory approval. As of June 30, 2024, we had capitalized pre-launch COVID-19 vaccine inventory of\n$165 million in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the third quarter of 2024 and the subsequent period, our vaccine targeting the KP.2 strain\nreceived approval from the FDA and Health Canada, while our vaccine targeting the JN.1 strain was approved by regulatory authorities in the European Union,\nthe United Kingdom, and other global markets. We have since commenced the supply of this updated vaccine to customers.\n8.

Leases\nWe have entered into various long-term, non-cancelable lease arrangements for our facilities and equipment, expiring at various times through 2042. Certain of\nthese arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize lease costs under such arrangements on a straight-line basis over\nthe life of the lease. We have two main campuses in Massachusetts, our Cambridge campus and our Moderna Technology Center (MTC), an industrial\ntechnology center located in Norwood. We also lease various parcels of land, as well as office, lab, and manufacturing spaces across the globe for our business\noperations.\nCambridge Campus\nOur Cambridge campus consists of multiple leased properties, including office and research laboratory spaces totaling approximately 667,000 square feet,\nincluding the Moderna Science Center.\nModerna Science Center\nIn September 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for a building in Cambridge, Massachusetts, comprising approximately 462,000 square feet. This facility,\nwhich includes our principal executive offices along with additional office and laboratory spaces, is referred to as the Moderna Science Center (MSC). After an\napproximately two-year building project, the lease term is 15 years, with options for two additional seven-year extensions. During the third quarter of 2023, we\ncommenced the lease and recognized the related right-of-use asset and lease liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nFollowing the commencement of the MSC lease, we amended the expiration dates of our existing leases at Technology Square in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOriginally scheduled to expire ranging from 2024 to 2029, these leases have been adjusted to conclude by early 2025. All our Cambridge leases are classified\nas operating leases.\nModerna Technology Center\nOur MTC is composed of three buildings, MTC South, MTC North and MTC East, totaling approximately 686,000 square feet. Our MTC leases expire in 2042\nand we have the option to extend the term for three extension periods of five years each. All of our MTC leases are classified as finance leases.\nIn September 2024, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the properties we currently lease in Norwood, Massachusetts, where the MTC is located.\nThe total purchase price for the properties is approximately $370 million. In October 2024, we made a nonrefundable deposit of $50 million as part of the\ntransaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, with an anticipated closing date in December 2024.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOperating and financing lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nAssets:\nRight-of-use assets, operating, net(1) (2) $ 784 $ 713\nRight-of-use assets, financing, net(3) (4) 498 436\nTotal $ 1,282 $ 1,149\nLiabilities:\nCurrent:\nOperating lease liabilities(5) $ 21 $ 25\nFinancing lease liabilities(5) 30 —\nTotal current lease liabilities 51 25\nNon-current:\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 679 643\nFinancing lease liabilities, non-current 625 575\nTotal non-current lease liabilities 1,304 1,218\nTotal $ 1,355 $ 1,243\n_______\n(1)These assets are real estate related assets, which include land, office, manufacturing, and laboratory spaces.\n(2)Net of accumulated amortization.\n(3)These assets are real estate assets related to the MTC leases and contract manufacturing service agreements.\n(4)Included in property, plant and equipment in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, net of accumulated depreciation.\n(5)Included in other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nFuture minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable lease agreements as of September 30, 2024, were as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Operating Leases Financing Leases(1)\n2024 (remainder of the year) $ 17 $ 19\n2025 71 47\n2026 73 47\n2027 78 42\n2028 81 23\nThereafter 841 1,074\nTotal minimum lease payments 1,161 1,252\nLess amounts representing interest or imputed interest (461) (597)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 700 $ 655\n______\n(1)Includes certain optional lease term extensions, predominantly related to the MTC leases, which represent a total of $668 million of undiscounted future lease\npayments.\n11. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered ordinary course in our business. The outcome of any such proceedings,\nregardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the likelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to considerable\njudgment. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings for which a material loss is probable, or for which a loss is reasonably estimable at this time.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIndemnification Obligations\nAs permitted under Delaware law, we indemnify our officers, directors, and employees for certain events, occurrences while the officer, or director is, or was,\nserving at our request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification is for the officer’s or director’s lifetime.\nWe have standard indemnification arrangements in our leases for laboratory and office space that require us to indemnify the landlord against any liability for\ninjury, loss, accident, or damage from any claims, actions, proceedings, or costs resulting from certain acts, breaches, violations, or non-performance under our\nleases.\nWe enter into indemnification provisions under our agreements with counterparties in the ordinary course of business, typically with business partners,\ncontractors, clinical sites and customers. Under these provisions, we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or\nincurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities. These indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement. The\nmaximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited.\nThrough the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we had not experienced any material losses related to\nthese indemnification obligations, and no material claims were outstanding. We do not expect significant claims related to these indemnification obligations\nand, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established.\nPurchase Commitments and Purchase Orders\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors and contract manufacturing organizations for raw materials and manufacturing services\nand with vendors for preclinical research studies, clinical trials and other goods or services. As of September 30, 2024, we had $1.2 billion of non-cancelable\npurchase commitments related to raw materials and manufacturing agreements, which are expected to be paid through 2029. As of September 30, 2024, we had\n$342 million of non-cancelable purchase commitments related to research and development and other goods and services which are expected to be paid\nthrough 2031. These amounts represent our minimum contractual obligations, including termination fees.\nIn addition to purchase commitments, we have agreements with third parties for various goods and services, including services related to clinical operations\nand support and contract manufacturing, for which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience and avoid any and all future obligations to the\nvendors. Certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or winddown costs. Under such agreements, we are contractually\nobligated to make certain payments to vendors, mainly, to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation. As of September 30,\n2024, we had cancelable open purchase orders of $3.3 billion in total under such agreements for our significant clinical operations and support and contract\nmanufacturing. These amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay as of September 30, 2024,\nassuming we would not cancel these agreements. The actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the purchase\norder amounts.\nLicenses to Patented Technology\nWe have patent license agreements with Cellscript, LLC and its affiliate, mRNA RiboTherapeutics, Inc., and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious\nDiseases. Under these agreements, we are required to pay royalties and certain milestone payments. For further information on our licensing and royalty\npayments, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Business—Intellectual Property—In-licensed intellectual property” and Note 11 to our\nconsolidated financial statements contained therein.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $92 million and $110 million, respectively, of royalty expenses associated with our\nproduct sales. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $78 million and $176 million, respectively, of royalty expenses\nassociated with our product sales. These royalty expenses were recorded to cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAdditionally, we have other in-license agreements with third parties which require us to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone\npayments and sales-based royalties for specified products associated with the agreements. The achievement of these milestones have not yet occurred as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n25\nTable of Contents\n12. Stock-Based Compensation and Share Repurchase Programs\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents the components and classification of stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOptions $ 44 $ 32 $ 124 $ 102\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) and Performance Stock Units (PSUs) 68 43 196 117\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) — 2 5 7\nTotal $ 112 $ 77 $ 325 $ 226\nCost of sales $ 6 $ 7 $ 19 $ 28\nResearch and development 69 40 196 115\nSelling, general and administrative 37 30 110 83\nTotal $ 112 $ 77 $ 325 $ 226\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $875 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation with respect to\noptions, RSUs and PSUs granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years as of September 30, 2024.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nAs of September 30, 2024, $1.7 billion of our Board of Directors’ authorization for repurchases of our common stock (the 2022 Repurchase Programs) remains\noutstanding, with no expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the 2022 Repurchase Programs will depend on a variety of\nfactors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market\npurchases through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares repurchased.\n13. Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes our income tax expense for the periods presented (in millions, except for percentages):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 21 $ (1,958) $ (2,423) $ (4,012)\nProvision for income taxes $ 8 $ 1,672 $ 18 $ 919\nEffective tax rate 39.2 % (85.5)% (0.7)% (22.9)%\nThe effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate, primarily due to our global valuation\nallowance, which limits our ability to recognize tax benefits from the loss. The higher effective tax rate was also due to certain of our foreign subsidiaries that\nhave taxable income, while we incurred a net loss before income taxes in other jurisdictions. The decrease in our effective tax rate, compared to the same\nperiods in 2023, was primarily attributable to the establishment of a $1.7 billion valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2023. This\nvaluation allowance has been applied consistently since its initial recognition in the third quarter of 2023. For additional details regarding our deferred tax\nassets and the policies governing our valuation allowance, please refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe periodically reassess the need for valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, considering both positive and negative evidence to evaluate whether it is\nmore likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. Significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our\ndeferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates, we adjust our estimates in future periods and we may need to modify our valuation\nallowance, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe file U.S. federal income tax returns and income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We are not currently subject to any tax\nassessment from an income tax examination in the U.S. or any other major taxing jurisdiction.\n14. Earnings (Loss) per Share\nThe computation of basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS) is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding. The computation of\ndiluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding and potential dilutive common shares during the period as determined\nby using the treasury stock method.\nBasic and diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were calculated as follows (in millions, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 13 $ (3,630) $ (2,441) $ (4,931)\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted-average common shares outstanding 385 381 383 382\nEffect of dilutive securities 14 — — —\nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding 399 381 383 382\nBasic EPS $ 0.03 $ (9.53) $ (6.37) $ (12.89)\nDiluted EPS $ 0.03 $ (9.53) $ (6.37) $ (12.89)\nCommon stock equivalents excluded from the EPS computation above\nbecause their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive 11 28 33 28\n27\nTable of Contents\n2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited financial information\nand related notes included in this Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on February 23, 2024\n(the 2023 Form 10-K).\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company advancing a new class of medicines made of messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA medicines are designed to direct the body’s\ncells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of\ndiseases. Our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mRNA science, delivery technology and manufacturing, providing us the capability\nto pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates. We are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases, immuno-oncology,\nrare diseases and autoimmune diseases, independently and with our strategic collaborators.\nSince our founding in 2010, we have transformed from a research-stage company advancing programs in the field of mRNA to a commercial enterprise with a\ndiverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across several modalities, a broad intellectual property portfolio and integrated manufacturing\ncapabilities that allow for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale. We have a diverse and extensive development pipeline of 36 development\ncandidates across our 45 development programs, of which 42 are in clinical studies currently.\nOur COVID-19 vaccine is our first commercial product and is marketed, where approved, under the name Spikevax®. Our original vaccine, mRNA-1273,\ntargeted the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain, and we have leveraged our mRNA platform to rapidly adapt our vaccine to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains to\nprovide protection as the virus evolves and regulatory guidance is updated. In May 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval for\nmRESVIA® (mRNA-1345), our mRNA vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), to protect adults aged 60 and older from lower respiratory tract\ndisease caused by RSV infection. This marks our second approved mRNA product and underscores our ongoing commitment to delivering solutions for\npatients by addressing global public health threats related to infectious diseases.\nBusiness Highlights\nCOVID-19\nConsistent with guidance from regulators, we updated our COVID-19 vaccine to target the KP.2 and JN.1 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the 2024-2025\nseason. During the third quarter of 2024, our vaccine targeting the KP.2 strain received approval from the FDA and Health Canada, while our vaccine targeting\nthe JN.1 strain was approved by regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan and other jurisdictions. We have since\ncommenced the supply of these vaccines to customers.\nRSV\nIn May 2024, the FDA approved mRESVIA to protect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection. The\napproval was granted under a breakthrough therapy designation. Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a\nrecommendation for all unvaccinated people 75 years of age and older and unvaccinated people ages 60-74 who are at increased risk. In August 2024, the\nEuropean Commission (EC) granted marketing authorization for mRESVIA to protect adults aged 60 years and older from lower respiratory tract disease\ncaused by RSV infection. The authorization is valid in all 27 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. We have also filed for mRNA-\n1345 approval with regulators in multiple markets worldwide and commenced sales in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024.\nModerna's Canadian Manufacturing Facility\nIn September 2024, our manufacturing facility in Laval, Quebec, received a Drug Establishment License (DEL) from Health Canada, certifying the site’s\ncompliance with the required safety and quality standards to produce drug substance. This certification marked a significant step in enabling our Canadian\nfacility to become fully operational, supporting domestic manufacturing of mRNA vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, with production expected to begin\nin 2025.\nNet Product Sales and Net Loss Per Share\nFor the third quarter of 2024, we recognized net product sales of $1.8 billion from sales of our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines,\n28\nTable of Contents\ncompared to $1.8 billion for the third quarter of 2023. Earnings per share was $0.03 for the third quarter of 2024, compared to loss per share of $(9.53) for the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nRecent Program Developments\nRespiratory Virus Vaccines\n• RSV. In September 2024, we announced positive Phase 3 results for our RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59. In the trial,\nmRNA-1345 met all primary immunogenicity endpoints and the 50 µg dose, which is the same for the currently approved mRESVIA vaccine for\nadults 60 years and above, was well tolerated with no safety concerns identified.\n• Next-generation COVID-19. In September 2024, we shared positive Phase 3 vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity data for our next-generation\nCOVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283).\n• Flu. In September 2024, we announced that we are no longer pursuing an accelerated approval pathway for the regulatory submission of our\nstandalone flu vaccine, mRNA-1010, to focus our resources on the submission of a potentially more impactful Flu+COVID combination vaccine,\nmRNA-1083. In September 2024, we initiated a Phase 3 efficacy study (P304) for mRNA-1010, funded by previously announced project financing\nthrough Blackstone Life Sciences.\n• We intend to file in 2024 for approval of our next-generation COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1283) and our RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for high-risk\nadults ages 18 to 59. We intend to use priority review vouchers for those programs. For our Flu+COVID combination vaccine (mRNA-1083), we\nintend to file in 2024, subject to ongoing discussions with the FDA, and we have decided not to use a priority review voucher.\nLatent and Other Virus Vaccines\n• Cytomegalovirus (CMV). We expect to have accrued the 81 cases necessary to trigger the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 vaccine efficacy study of\nour CMV vaccine candidate (mRNA-1647) by the end of 2024.\n• Norovirus. In September 2024, we announced that the first participant in the U.S. had been dosed in the pivotal Phase 3 trial of our investigational\nmRNA trivalent norovirus vaccine, mRNA-1403. We had previously announced that an interim analysis had shown that a single dose of mRNA-1403\nelicited a robust immune response across all dose levels evaluated with a clinically acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile. Additionally, robust\nhisto-blood group antigen (HBGA) blocking antibody titers were observed against vaccine-matched norovirus genogroup I and II selected strains\nacross all dose levels evaluated. Similar mRNA-1403-induced HBGA-blocking antibody titers were observed in younger adult and older adult age\ngroups.\nOncology Therapeutics\n• Individualized neoantigen therapy (INT). In October 2024, we and Merck initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating adjuvant INT (mRNA-4157) in\ncombination with KEYTRUDA after neoadjuvant KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy in patients with certain types of resected non-small cell lung\ncancer. This is the third Phase 3 trial for the investigational INT focused on earlier stages of cancer.\nDiscontinued Programs\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we announced that five programs in our pipeline have been discontinued due to our strategic prioritization efforts:\n• Endemic HCoV (mRNA-1287): The preclinical program will not advance into Phase 1.\n• RSV infants (seronegative, <2 years) (mRNA-1345): We do not expect the program to advance beyond the ongoing Phase 1 based on emerging\nclinical data.\n• KRAS antigen-specific therapy (mRNA-5671): We have no further development plans.\n• Triplet (OX40L/IL-23/IL-36γ) (mRNA-2752): We have deprioritized further development based on emerging clinical data.\n• Relaxin (mRNA-0184): The program is wrapping up Phase 1.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur Pipeline\nThe following chart shows our current pipeline of 45 development programs across our several modalities.\nAbbreviations: BARDA, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority; CMV, cytomegalovirus; cSCC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HIV, human\nimmunodeficiency virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; HSV, herpes simplex virus; IAVI, International AIDS Vaccine Initiative; ILCM, Institute for Life Changing Medicines; IM, infectious\nmononucleosis; NIH, National Institutes of Health; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; VZV, varicella-zoster virus.\n30\nTable of Contents\nResults of operations\nThe following table summarizes our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 vs. 2023\n2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue:\nNet product sales $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 63 4%\nOther revenue 42 74 (32) (43)%\nTotal revenue 1,862 1,831 31 2%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales 514 2,241 (1,727) (77)%\nResearch and development 1,137 1,160 (23) (2)%\nSelling, general and administrative 281 442 (161) (36)%\nTotal operating expenses 1,932 3,843 (1,911) (50)%\nLoss from operations (70) (2,012) 1,942 (97)%\nInterest income 103 105 (2) (2)%\nOther expense, net (12) (51) 39 (76)%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 21 (1,958) 1,979 101%\nProvision for income taxes 8 1,672 (1,664) (100)%\nNet income (loss) $ 13 $ (3,630) $ 3,643 100%\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 vs. 2023\n2024 2023 $ %\nRevenue:\nNet product sales $ 2,171 $ 3,878 $ (1,707) (44)%\nOther revenue 99 159 (60) (38)%\nTotal revenue 2,270 4,037 (1,767) (44)%\nOperating expenses:\nCost of sales 725 3,764 (3,039) (81)%\nResearch and development 3,421 3,439 (18) (1)%\nSelling, general and administrative 823 1,079 (256) (24)%\nTotal operating expenses 4,969 8,282 (3,313) (40)%\nLoss from operations (2,699) (4,245) 1,546 (36)%\nInterest income 334 318 16 5%\nOther expense, net (58) (85) 27 (32)%\nLoss before income taxes (2,423) (4,012) 1,589 (40)%\nProvision for income taxes 18 919 (901) (98)%\nNet loss $ (2,441) $ (4,931) $ 2,490 (50)%\nRevenue\nNet product sales\nNet product sales by customer geographic location were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnited States $ 1,215 $ 913 $ 1,477 $ 916\nEurope 281 103 281 739\nRest of world 324 741 413 2,223\nTotal $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\n31\nTable of Contents\nNet product sales by product were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nCOVID-19 $ 1,810 $ 1,757 $ 2,161 $ 3,878\nRSV 10 — 10 —\nTotal $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have two commercial products authorized for use, our COVID-19 vaccine and our RSV vaccine. The RSV vaccine was\napproved by the FDA in May 2024 for adults aged 60 years and older.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. commercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign\ngovernments and international organizations. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in the third quarter of 2024. In the U.S., our COVID-19 and RSV\nvaccines are sold primarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. Net product sales are recognized\nnet of estimated wholesaler chargebacks, invoice discounts for prompt payments and pre-orders, provisions for sales returns and government rebates, and other\nrelated deductions.\nThe following table summarizes product sales provision for the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGross product sales $ 2,964 $ 2,420 $ 3,377 $ 4,541\nProduct sales provision:\nWholesaler chargebacks, discounts and fees (1,053) (479) (1,053) (479)\nReturns, rebates and other fees (91) (184) (153) (184)\nTotal product sales provision(1) $ (1,144) $ (663) $ (1,206) $ (663)\nNet product sales $ 1,820 $ 1,757 $ 2,171 $ 3,878\n_______\n(1)Includes an adjustment of approximately $140 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a reduction in prior period provision estimates, primarily related\nto returns for the previous COVID-19 vaccine season that closed during the quarter.\nPrior to the third quarter of 2023, we sold our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations. The\nagreements and related amendments with these entities generally do not include variable consideration, such as discounts, rebates or returns. Certain of these\nagreements entitle us to upfront deposits for our COVID-19 vaccine supply, initially recorded as deferred revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we had deferred\nrevenue of $443 million associated with customer deposits received or billable under supply agreements, with the majority of our COVID-19 vaccine deliveries\nscheduled in 2024.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue comprises grant revenue, collaboration revenue, and licensing and royalty revenue.\nTotal revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, total revenue decreased by $1.8 billion, or 44%, compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to lower net product sales of our\nCOVID-19 vaccine.\nNet product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $63 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by\nhigher sales in the U.S. market following the earlier launch of our updated COVID-19 vaccine for the season, and an approximately $140 million adjustment\nrelated to the reduction in prior period sales provision estimates. With FDA approval granted three weeks earlier than in the previous year, we were able to meet\ndemand more effectively. This increase was partially offset by lower international sales, which in 2023 had benefited from the fulfillment of orders deferred\nfrom 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net product sales decreased by $1.7 billion, or 44%, compared to the same period in 2023. This\ndecline reflects the transition of the COVID-19 vaccine market from pandemic-driven demand to a more seasonal commercial pattern, with sales in 2024\nexhibiting greater seasonality and reduced overall demand.\nWe expect higher demand for our COVID-19 and RSV vaccines in the fall and winter seasons each year across both hemispheres, as countries prepare for\nseasonal vaccination campaigns. For the full year of 2024, we anticipate further reductions in net product sales\n32\nTable of Contents\nfor our COVID-19 vaccine compared to 2023 as the market continues to evolve into a seasonal commercial model. Although we commenced sales of our RSV\nvaccine in the third quarter of 2024, these sales are not expected to have a significant impact on our overall product sales for the year.\nOther revenue decreased by $32 million, or 43%, and $60 million, or 38%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to\nthe same periods in 2023. The decrease for the three and nine months ended was mainly due to a reduction in grant revenue under our agreement with\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for the development of our COVID-19 vaccine, partially offset by an increase in\nlicensing and royalty revenue.\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $514 million, which included third-party royalties of $92 million, inventory write-downs of\n$214 million, unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind-down costs of $27 million. Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\n$725 million, which included third-party royalties of $110 million, inventory write-downs of $302 million, primarily related to our finished and semi-finished\nCOVID-19 vaccine inventory and certain raw materials, unutilized manufacturing capacity and wind-down costs of $109 million, and a $57 million benefit\nfrom the sale of previously written-down zero-cost inventory. Please refer to Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for inventory related\ncharges. These charges in 2024, other than royalties, were largely driven by customer demand forecast adjustments and commitments related to manufacturing\ncapacity.\nCost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $1.7 billion, or 77%, compared to the same period in 2023. Cost of sales as a\npercentage of net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 28%, compared to 128% for the same period in 2023. Cost of sales for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $3.0 billion, or 81%, compared to the same period in 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of net product\nsales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33%, compared to 97% for the same period in 2023. The decrease in cost of sales for both the three-\nand nine-month periods in 2024 was primarily driven by reduced inventory write-downs, unutilized manufacturing capacity, and purchase commitment related\ncancellation fees. In addition, the reduction reflects the impact of a strategic cost initiative launched in the third quarter of 2023 to optimize our COVID-19\nbusiness by resizing manufacturing operations in response to the shift toward an endemic seasonal market. This initiative, which incurred $1.4 billion in\ncharges during the third quarter of 2023, helped drive improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions in 2024. The decrease in cost of sales as a\npercentage of net product sales for both the three- and nine-month periods in 2024 was mainly driven by reduced costs, while the decrease for the nine-month\nperiod was partially offset by the lower sales volume, reflecting a decline in product demand and increased seasonality.\nWe anticipate that the full year cost of sales as a percentage of net product sales for 2024 will be lower than the 70% experienced in 2023. This expectation is\nbased on projected improvements in our manufacturing efficiency and expected reductions in inventory write-downs. However, due to the strong seasonality of\nour business, we expect this percentage to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter anticipated to be higher\nthan the third quarter.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $23 million, or 2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThis reduction was primarily due to decreases in clinical trial expenses of $182 million and clinical manufacturing expenses of $92 million. These decreases\nwere partially offset by the purchase of a priority review voucher, along with a $38 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses decreased by $18 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023.\nThis reflects a $332 million reduction in clinical trial expenses, a $150 million reduction in clinical manufacturing expenses, and an $85 million reduction in\nupfront license payments. These reductions were offset by a $193 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation, as well as the\npurchase of two priority review vouchers. The increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation for both periods was driven by higher\nheadcount to support our continued research and development efforts. The decrease in clinical trial expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024,\nwas mainly due to reduced spending on our COVID-19 and RSV programs. For the nine-month period, the decrease was largely attributable to reduced\nspending on our COVID-19, RSV and seasonal flu programs, in line with our planned trial schedules.\nWe anticipate a modest reduction in research and development expenses in 2024 compared to 2023 levels. We continue to develop our pipeline and advance\nour product candidates into later-stage development, particularly our ongoing Phase 3 studies. These include our next-generation COVID-19, seasonal flu,\nCMV, norovirus and combination vaccine programs, as well as our INT program.\n33\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $161 million, or 36%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nin 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction of $105 million in consulting and outside services across all functions, as well as a $36 million\nreduction in commercial and marketing related expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses\ndecreased by $256 million, or 24%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decline for the nine-month period was mainly due to a $250 million reduction in\nconsulting and outside services across all functions, along with a $51 million reduction in commercial and marketing related expenses. These decreases were\npartially offset by a $48 million increase in personnel-related costs and stock-based compensation, primarily driven by an expanded headcount in digital,\nmedical affairs and commercial functions to support our digital and artificial intelligence initiatives, as well as our marketed products. The decrease in both\nperiods reflects cost discipline and efficiencies gained by reducing reliance on external consultants and bringing more functions in-house.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses in 2024 will be lower than the levels experienced in 2023. This reflects our ongoing\ncommitment to efficiency as we expand our global commercial, regulatory, sales and marketing infrastructure, while continuing to invest in digital capabilities\nand leverage artificial intelligence technologies. These efforts align with our strategic focus on advancing our program development and enhancing our overall\nbusiness processes.\nInterest income\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, interest income decreased by $2 million, or 2%, compared to the same period in 2023. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, interest income increased by $16 million, or 5%, compared to the same period in 2023. Overall, interest income from our\ninvestments in marketable securities remained relatively flat across both periods. The decrease in the three-month period was primarily due to lower average\ninvestment balances, while the increase for the nine-month period was driven by the overall higher interest rate environment.\nOther expense, net\nThe following tables summarize other expense, net for the periods presented (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 vs. 2023\n2024 2023 $ %\nLoss on investments $ (9) $ (37) $ 28 (76)%\nInterest expense (6) (10) 4 (40)%\nOther income (loss), net 3 (4) 7 175%\nTotal other expense, net $ (12) $ (51) $ 39 (76)%\nNine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 vs. 2023\n2024 2023 $ %\nLoss on investments $ (47) $ (50) $ 3 (6)%\nInterest expense (18) (32) 14 (44)%\nOther income (loss), net 7 (3) 10 333%\nTotal other expense, net $ (58) $ (85) $ 27 (32)%\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, total other expense, net decreased by $39 million and $27 million, or 76% and 32%, respectively,\ncompared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in total other expense, net for the three-month period was primarily driven by a reduction in losses on\nequity investments. For the nine-month period, the decrease was mainly due to lower losses on available-for-sale debt securities and reduced interest expense,\npartially offset by an increase in losses on equity investments. Our interest expense is primarily related to our finance leases. Please refer to Note 10 to our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIncome taxes\nProvision for income taxes decreased by $1.7 billion and $901 million, or 100% and 98%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared\nto the same periods in 2023. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to the establishment of a $1.7 billion valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in\nthe third quarter of 2023. This valuation allowance has been applied consistently since its initial recognition in the third quarter of 2023. As a result, we are\nunable to recognize tax benefits from the loss due to our global valuation allowance. Consequently, the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 are not comparable to the same periods in the prior year. Please refer to Note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nThe following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, investments and working capital as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,644 $ 2,907\nInvestments 5,223 5,697\nInvestments, non-current 2,335 4,677\nTotal $ 9,202 $ 13,281\nWorking capital:\nCurrent assets $ 9,666 $ 10,325\nCurrent liabilities 2,201 3,015\nTotal $ 7,465 $ 7,310\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation.\nInvestments, consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities, are stated at fair value. Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of September\n30, 2024 decreased by $4.1 billion, or 31%, compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to a\nnet cash outflow from operating activities of $3.8 billion and purchases of property and equipment of $529 million during the nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\nWorking capital, which is current assets less current liabilities, as of September 30, 2024 increased by $155 million, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to an increase in accounts receivable of $672 million, mainly due to timing of collections, a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable of $569\nmillion, driven by lower spend during the period, and an increase in inventory of $210 million, driven by manufacturing of COVID-19 product, partially offset\nby a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, other than those obligations and commitments disclosed herein.\nCash flow\nThe following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each period presented (in millions):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (3,829) $ (3,740)\nInvesting activities 2,488 4,744\nFinancing activities 59 (1,268)\nOperating activities\nWe derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from customer deposits and accounts receivable related to our product sales, as well as\ncertain government-sponsored and private organizations, strategic alliances and funding arrangements. Our\n35\nTable of Contents\ncash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2020, we entered into supply agreements with the U.S. Government, foreign governments and international organizations for\nthe supply of our COVID-19 vaccine and received upfront deposits. In the third quarter of 2023, we commenced sales of our COVID-19 vaccine to the U.S.\ncommercial market, in addition to continuing sales to foreign governments and international organizations. In the U.S., our COVID-19 vaccine is sold\nprimarily to wholesalers and distributors, and to a lesser extent, directly to retailers and healthcare providers. We also commenced sales of our RSV vaccine in\nthe third quarter of 2024. Wholesalers and distributors typically do not make upfront payments to us. As of September 30, 2024, we had $443 million in\ndeferred revenue related to customer deposits received or billable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3.8 billion and consisted of net loss of $2.4 billion, non-cash\nadjustments of $427 million and a net change in assets and liabilities of $1.8 billion. Non-cash items primarily included stock-based compensation of $325\nmillion, and depreciation and amortization of $129 million. The net change in assets and liabilities was mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable of\n$672 million driven by timing of invoicing, a decrease in accrued liabilities and accounts payable of $518 million, driven by overall lower spend in the period,\nan increase in inventory of $208 million, driven by manufacturing of COVID-19 products, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $177 million due to revenue\nrecognized in excess of customer deposits received.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased by $89 million, or 2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily attributable to a change in deferred income taxes of $934 million driven by an increase in valuation allowance, a change in prepaid expense and other\nassets of $919 million mainly related to prepayment of clinical studies and contract manufacturing organization activities, a change in inventory of $670\nmillion driven by less inventory write-downs, partially offset by a decrease in net loss of $2.5 billion.\nInvesting activities\nOur primary investing activities consist of purchases, sales, and maturities of our investments, capital expenditures for land, building, leasehold improvements,\nmanufacturing, laboratory, computer equipment and software, and business development.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.5 billion, which primarily included proceeds from maturities\nand sales of marketable securities of $7.7 billion, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $4.6 billion, and purchases of property and equipment\nof $529 million.\nNet investing cash flows decreased by $2.3 billion, or 48%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to an increase in purchases of marketable securities of $2.5 billion.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $59 million, primarily due to proceeds from issuance of common\nstock through equity plans of $55 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $1.3 billion, or 105%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period\nin 2023, mainly due to a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $1.2 billion.\nOperation and funding requirements\nOur principal sources of funding as of September 30, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash we may generate from operations. We\ngenerated net income of $8.4 billion and $12.2 billion for the years ended in 2022 and 2021, respectively, following the authorization of our first commercial\nproduct in December 2020. From our inception to the end of 2020, we incurred significant losses from operations due to our significant research and\ndevelopment expenses. We also incurred a net loss of $2.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a net loss of $4.7 billion for the year\nended 2023. We have retained earnings of $11.2 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nWe have significant future capital requirements including expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities, operate our\norganization, and meet capital expenditure needs. We anticipate maintaining substantial expenses across all areas of our ongoing activities, particularly as we\ncontinue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines. This also extends to our\nmanufacturing costs, including our arrangements with our supply and manufacturing partners. Our ongoing work on our RSV, seasonal flu, CMV and norovirus\nvaccine candidates, individualized neoantigen therapy, next generation COVID-19 vaccine, combination vaccines, late-stage clinical development, investments\nin digital\n36\nTable of Contents\ncapabilities and artificial intelligence technologies, and buildout of global commercial, regulatory, sales and marketing infrastructure and manufacturing\nfacilities will require significant cash outflows in future periods, most of which will not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our partners or collaborators. In\naddition, we have substantial facility, lease and purchase obligations (refer to Note 10 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). We\nhave entered into various collaboration and licensing agreements, as well as a research and development funding arrangement with third parties. These\narrangements collectively encompass the funding of specific research and development activities, with the distinction that under the research and development\nfunding arrangement, we receive funding. However, for all these arrangements, we may be obligated to make potential future milestone and royalty payments.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of September 30, 2024, together with cash expected to be generated from product sales, will be\nsufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these financial\nstatements included in this Form 10-Q. We are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines, and we may\nencounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors, which may adversely affect our business. For example, we\nexperienced a decline in customer demand for our COVID-19 vaccine in 2023, and this trend continued into 2024, reflecting the market's ongoing transition to\na seasonal commercial pattern in the endemic COVID-19 vaccine market. We foresee that our commitment to investing in our business for future product\nlaunches may lead to continued negative cash flows from operations in upcoming periods. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial\nresources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a\nresult of a number of factors. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could utilize our available capital resources\nsooner than we currently expect.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nThere have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to those disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2024, other than disclosed within Note 5, Note 10 and Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no\nmaterial changes to our contractual obligations and commitments from those described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations” included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nOur market risks, and the way we manage them, are summarized in Part II, Item 7A., “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our\n2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our market risk or to our management of such risks for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nmeans controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files\nor submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and\nprincipal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment\nin evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as\nof September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept for a change in our logistics provider to support vaccine distribution and order management, there were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months\n37\nTable of Contents\nended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However,\nour management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud.\nA control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are\nmet. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to\ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and\ninstances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by the collusion\nof two or more people or by a management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about\nthe likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions;\nover time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because\nof the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nPART II\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered ordinary course in our business, including the intellectual property litigation\ndescribed in our 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” Most of the issues raised by these claims are highly complex and subject to\nsubstantial uncertainties. For a description of risks relating to these and other legal proceedings we face, see Part I, Item 1A., “Risk Factors,” of our 2023 Form\n10-K, including the discussion under the headings entitled “Risks related to our intellectual property” and “Risks related to the manufacturing of our\ncommercial products and product candidates.” The outcome of any such proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain; therefore, assessing the\nlikelihood of loss and any estimated damages is difficult and subject to considerable judgment.\nProceedings Related to Patents Owned by Alnylam\nAs previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K, in May 2023, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware asserting three U.S. patents concerning cationic lipids. In November 2023, the District Court entered an order of partial dismissal with\nrespect to two of the patents at issue. Subsequently, in October 2024, the District Court entered a final judgment of non-infringement in our favor with respect\nto the third patent at issue. The decision is subject to appeal.\nProceedings Related to Patents Owned by GSK\nCOVID-19 Vaccines\nIn October 2024, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK) filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting that our\nmanufacture and sale of our COVID-19 vaccines infringe certain U.S. patents directed to lipid-mRNA vaccine formulation technology. The complaint seeks a\njudgment of infringement of the asserted patents and unspecified damages, but does not seek injunctive relief.\nRSV Vaccine\nAlso in October 2024, GSK filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting that our manufacture and sale of our\nRSV vaccine infringes certain U.S. patents directed to lipid-mRNA vaccine formulation technology. The complaint seeks a judgment of infringement of the\nasserted patents, unspecified damages and injunctive relief in the United States.\nProceedings Related to Patents Owned by Northwestern University\nIn October 2024, Northwestern University filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware asserting that our COVID-19 and\nRSV vaccines infringe several U.S. patents concerning lipid nanoparticle technology. The complaint seeks a judgment of infringement of the asserted patents\nand unspecified damages. The complaint does not seek injunctive relief.\n38\nTable of Contents\nSecurities Class Action Litigation\nIn August 2024, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of\nMassachusetts. The action is purportedly brought on behalf of a class of shareholders who purchased Moderna common stock between January 18, 2023 and\nJune 25, 2024. The complaint asserts claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding statements about our RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) and seeks\nunspecified damages.\nDerivative Litigation\nBetween September and November 2024, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts\nagainst certain of our officers and directors and against the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaints allege breaches of fiduciary duty and claims\nunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding statements about mRNA-1345 and seek declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages\npayable to us.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInformation regarding risk and uncertainties related to our business appears in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no\nmaterial changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn August 1, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for our common stock of up to $3.0 billion, with no expiration date. During\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no shares repurchased. As of September 30, 2024, $1.7 billion of our Board of Directors’ authorization\nfor repurchases of our common stock remains outstanding, with no expiration date.\nFor details about our share repurchase programs, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, as set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K.\n39\nTable of Contents\nItem 6.

Mock\nNovember 7, 2024\nJames M. Mock\nChief Financial Officer\n(Principal Financial Officer)\n41\nExhibit 10.1\nMODERNA, INC.\n2018 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN\nThe purpose of the Moderna, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“the Plan”) is to provide eligible employees of Moderna, Inc. (the “Company”) and\neach Designated Company (as defined in Section 11) with opportunities to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the\n“Common Stock”). An aggregate of 810,000 shares of Common Stock have been approved and reserved for this purpose, plus on January 1, 2020 and each\nJanuary 1 thereafter, the number of shares of Common Stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan shall be cumulatively increased by the lesser of\n(i) 3,240,000 shares of Common Stock, (ii) one percent of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the immediately\npreceding December 31 or (iii) such lesser number of shares of Common Stock as determined by the Administrator.\nThe Plan includes two components: a Code Section 423 Component (the “423 Component”) and a non-Code Section 423 Component (the “Non-423\nComponent”). It is intended for the 423 Component to constitute an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the 423 Component shall be interpreted in accordance with that intent (although the Company makes no\nundertaking or representation to maintain such qualification). In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of options under the Non-423 Component that does not\nqualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Code. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Non-423 Component will operate and\nbe administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.\n1. Administration. The Plan will be administered by the person or persons (the “Administrator”) appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”)\nfor such purpose. The Administrator has authority at any time to: (i) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, subplans, guidelines and practices for the administration\nand operation of the Plan and for its own acts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable, including to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws,\nregulations and procedures for jurisdictions outside of the United States; (ii) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan; (iii) make all determinations it\ndeems advisable for the administration of the Plan; (iv) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan; and (v) otherwise supervise the administration of\nthe Plan. All interpretations and decisions of the Administrator shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the Participants. No member of the\nBoard or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect\nto the Plan or any option granted hereunder.\n2. Offerings. The Company will make one or more offerings to eligible employees to purchase Common Stock under the Plan (“Offerings”). Unless otherwise\ndetermined by the Administrator, an Offering will begin on the first business day occurring on or after each January 1st and July 1st and will end on the last\nbusiness day occurring on or before the following May 31st and November 30th, respectively. The Administrator may, in its discretion, designate a different\nperiod for any Offering, provided that no Offering shall exceed 27 months in duration or overlap any other Offering.\n3. Eligibility. All individuals classified as employees on the payroll records of the Company and each Designated Company are eligible to participate in any\none or more of the Offerings under the Plan, provided that as of the first day of the applicable Offering (the “Offering Date”) they are customarily employed by\nthe Company or a Designated Company for 20 hours or more a week, unless the exclusion of employees who do not meet this requirement is not permissible\nunder applicable law, and have completed at least 30 days of employment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, individuals who are not\ncontemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company for purposes of the Company’s or applicable Designated Company’s\npayroll system are not considered to be eligible employees of the Company or any Designated Company and shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan. In\nthe event any such individuals are reclassified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company for any purpose, including, without limitation, common\nlaw or statutory employees, by any action of any third party, including, without limitation, any government agency, or as a result of any private lawsuit, action\nor administrative proceeding, such individuals shall, notwithstanding such reclassification, remain ineligible for participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nthe exclusive means for individuals who are not contemporaneously classified as employees of the Company or a Designated Company on the Company’s or\nDesignated Company’s payroll system to become eligible to participate in a plan which is equivalent to this Plan is through the adoption of a subplan, which\nspecifically renders such individuals eligible to participate therein.\n4. Participation.\n(a) Participants. An eligible employee who is not a Participant in any prior Offering may participate in a subsequent Offering by submitting (either in electronic\nor written form, according to procedures established by the Company) an enrollment form to his or her appropriate payroll location at least 5 business days\nbefore the Offering Date (or by such other deadline as shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering).\n(b) Enrollment. The enrollment form will (a) state a whole percentage to be contributed from an eligible employee’s Compensation (as defined in Section 11)\nper pay period, (b) authorize the purchase of Common Stock in each Offering in accordance with the terms of the Plan and (c) specify the exact name or names\nin which shares of Common Stock purchased for such individual are to be issued or transferred pursuant to Section 10. An employee who does not enroll in\naccordance with these procedures will be deemed to have waived the right to participate. Unless a Participant submits (either in electronic or written form,\naccording to procedures established by the Company) a new enrollment form or withdraws from the Plan, such Participant’s contributions and purchases will\ncontinue at the same percentage of Compensation for future Offerings, provided he or she remains eligible.\n(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, participation in the Plan will neither be permitted nor be denied contrary to the requirements of the Code and any applicable\nlaw.\n5. Employee Contributions. Each eligible employee may authorize payroll deductions at a minimum of 1 percent up to a maximum of 15 percent of such\nemployee’s Compensation for each pay period; provided, however, that if payroll deductions are not permitted or problematic under applicable law or for\nadministrative reasons, the Company, in its discretion, may allow eligible employees to contribute to the Plan by other means. The Company will maintain\nbook accounts showing the amount of payroll deductions or other contributions made by each Participant for each Offering. No interest will accrue or be paid\non payroll deductions or other contributions, unless required under applicable law.\n6. Contribution Changes. Except as may be determined by the Administrator in advance of an Offering, a Participant may not increase his or her contributions\nduring any Offering and may only decrease his or her contributions once during any Offering. However, during an Offering, a Participant may increase or\ndecrease his or her contributions with respect to the next Offering (subject to the limitations of Section 5) by submitting (either in electronic or written form,\naccording to procedures established by the Company) a new enrollment form at least 5 business days before the next Offering Date (or by such other deadline\nas shall be established by the Administrator for the Offering). The Administrator may, in advance of any Offering, establish rules permitting a Participant to\nincrease, decrease or terminate his or her contributions during an Offering.\n7. Withdrawal. A Participant may withdraw from participation in the Plan by submitting a notice of withdrawal to his or her appropriate payroll location (either\nin electronic or written form, according to procedures established by the Company). The Participant’s withdrawal will be effective if submitted at least 10\nbusiness days prior to the end of the Offering period. Following a Participant’s withdrawal, the Company will promptly refund such individual’s entire account\nbalance under the Plan to him or her (after payment for any Common Stock purchased before the effective date of withdrawal). Partial withdrawals are not\npermitted. Such an employee may not begin participation again during the remainder of the Offering, but may enroll in a subsequent Offering in accordance\nwith Section 4.\n8. Grant of Options. On each Offering Date, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a Participant in the Plan an option (“Option”) to\npurchase on the last day of such Offering (the “Exercise Date”), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, the lowest of (a) a number of shares of Common\nStock determined by dividing such Participant’s accumulated contributions on such Exercise Date by the lower of (i) 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the\nCommon Stock on the Offering Date, or (ii) 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Exercise Date, (b) 3,000 shares; or (c) such other\nlesser maximum number of shares as shall have been established by the Administrator in advance of the Offering; provided, however, that such Option shall be\nsubject to the limitations set forth below. Each Participant’s Option shall be exercisable only to the extent of such Participant’s accumulated payroll deductions\nand/or other contributions on the Exercise Date. The purchase price for\n2\neach share purchased under each Option (the “Option Price”) will be 85 percent of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the Offering Date or the\nExercise Date, whichever is less.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, no Participant may be granted an Option hereunder if such Participant, immediately after the Option was granted, would be\ntreated as owning stock possessing 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or\nSubsidiary (as defined in Section 11). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the\nstock ownership of a Participant, and all stock which the Participant has a contractual right to purchase shall be treated as stock owned by the Participant. In\naddition, no Participant may be granted an Option which permits his or her rights to purchase stock under the Plan, and any other employee stock purchase plan\nof the Company and its Parents and Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of the fair market value of such stock (determined on the Option\ngrant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. The purpose of the limitation in the preceding sentence is to comply\nwith Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and shall be applied taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted.\n9. Exercise of Option and Purchase of Shares. Each employee who continues to be a Participant in the Plan on the Exercise Date shall be deemed to have\nexercised his or her Option on such date and shall acquire from the Company such number of whole shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the\nPlan as his or her accumulated contributions on such date will purchase at the Option Price, subject to any other limitations contained in the Plan. Any amount\nremaining in a Participant’s account at the end of an Offering solely by reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share will be carried forward to the next\nOffering; any other balance remaining in a Participant’s account at the end of an Offering will be refunded to the Participant promptly.\nIf a Participant has more than one Option outstanding under the Plan, unless he or she otherwise indicates in agreements or notices delivered hereunder: (i)\neach agreement or notice delivered by that Participant shall be deemed to apply to all of his or her Options under the Plan; and (ii) an Option with a lower\nOption Price (or an earlier granted Option, if different Options have identical Option Prices) shall be exercised to the fullest possible extent before an Option\nwith a higher Option Price (or a later granted Option if different Options have identical Option Prices) shall be exercised.\n10. Issuance of Certificates. Certificates, or book entries for uncertificated shares, representing shares of Common Stock purchased under the Plan may be\nissued only in the name of the employee or, if permitted by the Administrator, in the name of the employee and another person of legal age as joint tenants with\nrights of survivorship, or in the name of a broker authorized by the employee to be his, her or their, nominee for such purpose.\n11. Definitions.\nThe term “Affiliate” means any entity that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company which does not meet the definition of a Subsidiary below, as\ndetermined by the Administrator, whether new or hereafter existing.\nThe term “Compensation” means the amount of base pay, prior to salary reduction pursuant to Sections 125, 132(f) or 401(k) of the Code or comparable\nreductions under laws outside the United States, but excluding overtime, commissions, incentive or bonus awards, allowances and reimbursements for\nexpenses such as relocation allowances or travel expenses, income or gains on the exercise, vesting or settlement of Company equity incentive awards, and\nsimilar items. The Administrator shall have the discretion to determine the application of this definition to Participants outside of the United States.\nThe term “Designated Company” means any present or future Affiliate or Subsidiary (as defined below) that has been designated by the Administrator to\nparticipate in the Plan. The Administrator may so designate any Affiliate or Subsidiary, or revoke any such designation, at any time and from time to time,\neither before or after the Plan is approved by the stockholders and may further designate such companies as participating in the 423 Component or the Non-423\nComponent. For purposes of the 423 Component, only Subsidiaries may be Designated Companies. The current list of Designated Companies is attached\nhereto as Appendix A.\n3\nThe term “Fair Market Value of the Common Stock” on any given date means the fair market value of the Common Stock determined in good faith by the\nAdministrator; provided, however, that if the Common Stock is admitted to quotation on the Nasdaq Global Market or another national securities exchange, the\ndetermination shall be made by reference to the closing price on such date. If there is no closing price for such date, the determination shall be made by\nreference to the last date preceding such date for which there is a closing price.\nThe term “Initial Public Offering” means the first day when trading prices for the Common Stock are reported on Nasdaq Global Market or another national\nsecurities exchange, pursuant to an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offer and sale by the\nCompany of its Common Stock.\nThe term “Parent” means a “parent corporation” with respect to the Company, as defined in Section 424(e) of the Code.\nThe term “Participant” means an individual who is eligible as determined in Section 3 and who has complied with the provisions of Section 4.\nThe term “Subsidiary” means a “subsidiary corporation” with respect to the Company, as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code.\n12. Rights on Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, if a Participant’s employment terminates for any reason before the\nExercise Date for any Offering, no contributions will be taken from any pay due and owing to the Participant and the balance in the Participant’s account will\nbe paid to such Participant or, in the case of such Participant’s death, if permitted by the Administrator, to his or her designated beneficiary as if such\nParticipant had withdrawn from the Plan under Section 7. An employee will be deemed to have terminated employment, for this purpose, if the corporation that\nemploys him or her, having been a Designated Company, ceases to be an Affiliate or a Subsidiary, as applicable, or if the employee is transferred to any\ncorporation other than the Company or a Designated Company. An employee will not be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose, if the\nemployee is on an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness or for any other purpose approved by the Company, if the employee’s right to\nreemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Administrator\notherwise provides in writing.\n13. Special Rules. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrator may adopt special rules applicable to the employees of a particular\nDesignated Company, whenever the Administrator determines that such rules are necessary or appropriate for the implementation of the Plan in a jurisdiction\nwhere such Designated Company has employees; provided that if such rules are inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423(b) of the Code, these\nemployees will participate in the Non-423 Component. Any special rules established pursuant to this Section 13 shall, to the extent possible, result in the\nemployees subject to such rules having substantially the same rights as other Participants in the Plan.\n14. Optionees Not Stockholders. Neither the granting of an Option to a Participant nor the deductions from his or her pay or other contributions shall deem\nsuch Participant to be a holder of the shares of Common Stock covered by an Option under the Plan until such shares have been purchased by and issued or\ntransferred to him or her.\n15. Rights Not Transferable. Rights under the Plan are not transferable by a Participant other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and are\nexercisable during the Participant’s lifetime only by the Participant.\n16. Application of Funds. All funds received or held by the Company under the Plan may be combined with other corporate funds and may be used for any\ncorporate purpose; unless otherwise required under applicable law.\n17. Adjustment in Case of Changes Affecting Common Stock. In the event of a subdivision of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the payment of a dividend\nin Common Stock or any other change affecting the Common Stock, the number of shares approved for the Plan and the share limitation set forth in Section 8\nshall be equitably or proportionately adjusted to give proper effect to such event.\n18. Amendment of the Plan. The Board may at any time and from time to time amend the Plan in any respect, except that without the approval within 12\nmonths of such Board action by the stockholders, no amendment shall be made\n4\nincreasing the number of shares approved for the Plan or making any other change that would require stockholder approval in order for the 423 Component of\nthe Plan, as amended, to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423(b) of the Code.\n19. Insufficient Shares. If the total number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be purchased on any Exercise Date plus the number of shares\npurchased under previous Offerings under the Plan exceeds the maximum number of shares issuable under the Plan, the shares then available shall be\napportioned among Participants in proportion to the amount of payroll deductions accumulated on behalf of each Participant that would otherwise be used to\npurchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date.\n20. Termination of the Plan. The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Board. Upon termination of the Plan, all amounts in the accounts of Participants\nshall be promptly refunded. The Plan shall automatically terminate on the ten year anniversary of the date of the Company’s Initial Public Offering.\n21. Compliance with Law. The Company’s obligation to sell and deliver Common Stock under the Plan is subject to completion of any registration or\nqualification of the Common Stock under any U.S. or non-U.S. local, state or federal securities or exchange control law or under rulings or regulations of the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or of any other governmental regulatory body, and to obtaining any approval or other clearance from any\nU.S. and non-U.S. local, state or federal governmental agency, which registration, qualification or approval the Company shall, in its absolute discretion, deem\nnecessary or advisable. The Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Common Stock with the SEC or any other U.S. or non-U.S. securities\ncommission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of such stock.\n22. Governing Law. This Plan and all Options and actions taken thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the General Corporation\nLaw of the State of Delaware as to matters within the scope thereof, and as to all other matters shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the\ninternal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, applied without regard to conflict of law principles.\n23. Issuance of Shares. Shares may be issued upon exercise of an Option from authorized but unissued Common Stock, from shares held in the treasury of the\nCompany, or from any other proper source.\n24. Tax Withholding. Participation in the Plan is subject to any minimum required tax withholding on income of the Participant in connection with the Plan.\nEach Participant agrees, by participating in the Plan, that the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall have the right to deduct any Tax Liability from\nany payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant, including shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan. Where a Tax Liability arises in\nconnection with the Plan, the Company and/or a Designated Company may require that, as a condition of exercise of an Option and purchase of shares of\nCommon Stock, a Participant must either:\n(a) make a payment to the Company, or otherwise as the Company directs, of an amount equal to the Company’s estimate of the amount of the Tax Liability; or\n(b) enter into arrangements acceptable to the Company to secure that such payment is made (whether by surrender of shares of Common Stock, net share\nissuance, the sale of shares of Common Stock or otherwise).\nFor these purposes, “Tax Liability” shall mean any amount of U.S. or non-U.S. federal, state or local income tax, social security (or similar) contributions,\npayroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account and/or other tax-related items related to the participation in the Plan and legally applicable to the\nParticipant, which the Company and/or an Affiliate or Subsidiary become liable to pay on the Participant’s behalf to the relevant authorities in any jurisdiction.\n25. Notification Upon Sale of Shares. Each Participant who is subject to tax in the United States with respect to his or her participation in the Plan agrees, by\nentering the Plan, to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares purchased under the Plan where such disposition occurs within two years\nafter the date of grant of the Option pursuant to which such shares were purchased or within one year after the date such shares were purchased.\n26. Effective Date and Approval of Shareholders. The Plan shall take effect on the date immediately preceding the date of the Company’s Initial Public\nOffering, subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present or by written consent of\nthe stockholders.\nLast updated July 25, 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX A\nDesignated Companies\n6\nExhibit 31.1\nCERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULES 13a-14(a) AND 15d-14(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS ADOPTED\nPURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002\nCERTIFICATIONS\nI, Stéphane Bancel, certify that:\n1.
