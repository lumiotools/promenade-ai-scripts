(“Mustang” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma.\n\nThe FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation to drugs and biologics that are intended for safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation provides certain incentives, such as tax credits toward the cost of clinical trials upon approval and prescription drug user fee waivers. If a product receives Orphan Drug Status from the FDA, that product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity for the disease in which it has Orphan Drug designation, which is independent from intellectual property protection.\n\nManuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang, said, “The Orphan Drug Designation for MB-108 is significant for Mustang, as it could provide additional market exclusivity and we hope to advance MB-108, in combination with MB-101, as a potential treatment option for patients living with malignant glioma, including patients with recurrent glioblastoma (“GBM”) and high-grade astrocytomas, where there is historically a median overall survival of six months. Our novel therapeutic strategy, combining our MB-108 oncolytic virus with MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy, could be the first-ever industry-sponsored trial of its kind for the treatment of malignant glioma. As such, Mustang plans to also request Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy) in malignant gliomas. These advancements highlight our dedication to potentially improving outcomes for patients battling difficult-to-treat cancers.”\n\nAs previously reported, preclinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting in 2022 supported a combination therapy to potentially optimize results to treat recurrent GBM. The combination leverages MB-108 to reshape the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) and make cold tumors “hot,” thereby potentially improving the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. Data presented separately on MB-101 and MB-108 showed that administration of these therapies was well tolerated in recurrent GBM patients. Two patients treated solely with MB-101 who had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors) achieved complete responses lasting 7.5 and 31+ months, respectively. Importantly, of the 53 City of Hope Phase 1 patients disclosed at AACR in 2022, these 2 complete responses were observed in the 2 patients with the “hottest” tumors prior to treatment with MB-101. Phase 1 clinical trials of MB-101 at City of Hope and of MB-108 at The University of Alabama at Birmingham continue to enroll patients.\n\nThe Company’s ability to further develop the MB-109 program for recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas is contingent upon raising additional funding and / or consummating a strategic partnership.\n\n**About MB-109 (MB-101 (IL13Rα2** **targeted CAR-T cells) + MB-108 oncolytic virus)** MB-109 is Mustang’s designation for the treatment regimen combining MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy licensed from City of Hope) with MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital). The combination is designed to leverage MB-108 to make cold tumors “hot” and potentially improve the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. MB-108 oncolytic virus is first injected to infect tumor cells which, in turn, leads to reshaping of the TME through recruitment of endogenous CD8- and CD3-positive effector T-cells. This inflamed TME potentially permits MB-101 CAR-T cells injected into and around the tumor to better infiltrate into and throughout the tumor mass, undergo activation and, ideally, effect tumor cell killing.\n\n**About Mustang Bio** Mustang Bio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers.

Exhibits 78\nSignatures 80\n2\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision in our securities. The risks described\nbelow are a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully\nconsider these risk factors, the risk factors described in Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Form 10-Q”), and the other\nreports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Related to our Finances and Capital Requirements\n● We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable\nfuture.\n● There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional financing in\nupcoming periods, which may not be available on acceptable terms to us, or at all. Failure to obtain necessary capital when\nneeded may force us to delay, limit or terminate our potential product candidates.\n● We have not generated any revenue from our development stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any\nrevenue.\n● Our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\n● Our success is contingent on raising additional capital, and our efforts to do so may fail. Even if successful, our future capital\nraising activities may dilute our current stockholders, restrict our operations, or cause us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n● Our future growth and success depend on our ability to successfully develop, and, if approved, commercialize our product\ncandidates, which we have yet to do.\n● Our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of our chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T cell\n(“CAR T”) technology product candidates.\n● Our strategic pivot to our lead product candidate, MB-106, and our disposal of non-core assets, including our facility, may not\nresult in the cost savings we anticipate and could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development and Commercialization\n● Preclinical development is highly speculative and carries a high failure risk.\n● We may not receive the required regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates on our projected timelines, if at all, which\nmay result in increased costs and delay our ability to generate revenue.\n● We may not obtain the desired labeling claims or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications, to\nsuccessfully promote our product candidates, if approved.\n● If a product candidate demonstrates adverse side effects, we may need to abandon or limit the development of such product\ncandidate.\n● Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical\ntrials, and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n● Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’\ncommercial opportunity and profitability.\n● If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such product\nwill likely be limited.\n● Any successful products’ liability claims related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur\nsubstantial liability and limit the commercialization of any such products.\n3\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\n● We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties\nmay not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or complying with applicable\nregulatory requirements.\n● We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and may also do so\nfor commercialization, if and when our product candidates are approved.\n● We rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties, which may prove inaccurate or unreliable.\n● We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be\navailable on commercially reasonable terms.\nRisks Relating to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n● We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or\nexecutive action may have on our operations.\n● We may be subject to anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other\nhealthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational\nharm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\n● We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and could become subject to fines or penalties\nor incur costs that could harm our business.\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n● If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could\ndevelop and commercialize products similar or identical to ours and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and\nproducts could therefore be impaired.\n● We depend on our licensors to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights covering certain of our product candidates.\n● We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property\nrights or to enforce our or our licensors’ intellectual property rights against third-party infringers.\n● Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Relating to Our Control by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”)\n● Fortress controls a voting majority of our common stock and has the right to receive significant share grants annually, which will\nresult in dilution of our other stockholders and could reduce the value of our common stock.\n● We have entered into certain agreements with Fortress and may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties.\n● We share certain directors with Fortress, which could create conflicts of interest between us and Fortress.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPART I.

As of June 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $394.4 million.\nThe Company has funded its operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and via debt raises. The Company expects to continue\nto use the proceeds from its previous financing transactions and asset sale primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe Company will require substantial additional financings through equity and debt offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or\nother sources to fully develop, prepare regulatory filings, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize its existing product candidates.\nThe continuation of our business as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional capital and eventually attaining and maintaining\nprofitable operations.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-40, Going Concern, the Company evaluated whether there are\nconditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one\nyear after the date that these unaudited consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into\nconsideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial\nstatements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its\nplans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of\nmanagement’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year\nafter the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant\nconditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that\nthese unaudited financial statements are issued. In performing its evaluation, management excluded certain elements of its operating plan\nthat cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future equity or debt issuances cannot\nbe considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within the Company’s control nor have been approved by the Board\nof Directors as of the date of these financial statements.\nThe Company's expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future, and the need for additional\nfunding to support its planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a\nperiod of one year after the date that these unaudited financial statements are issued. The Company made strategic decisions, including a\nsignificant reduction in the workforce by approximately 81% in April 2024, and also in April 2024, terminated certain license agreements\nwith St. Jude and Leiden University Medical Centre, and with Mayo Clinic in June 2024, to preserve capital and prioritize the allocation of\nresources. The Company continues to pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. The Company\nhas concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months\nfrom the date of issuance of these unaudited financial statements.\nThe accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of\nassets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include\n10\nTable of Contents\nany adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities\nthat may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation\nS-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information\nand footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the interim unaudited financial\nstatements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the balances and\nresults for the periods presented. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial\nstatements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes\nthereto for the year ended December 31, 2023, which were included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 11, 2024 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). The results of operations for any interim\nperiods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company’s unaudited financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. The\nCompany’s significant estimates include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such\nestimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company records cash held in an escrow account as a security deposit for the manufacturing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, as\nrestricted cash.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from the Unaudited Balance Sheets to the\nUnaudited Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023:\nJune 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,268 $ 15,385\nRestricted cash 375 750\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 4,643 $ 16,135\nAssets Held for Sale\nAssets held for sale represent assets that have met the criteria of “held for sale” accounting, as specified by Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 360, “Long-lived Assets.” As of June 30, 2024, there were $2.2 million of lab and cell processing equipment,\nfurniture and fixtures and computer equipment that are recorded as assets held for sale. The effect of suspending depreciation on the assets\nheld for sale is immaterial to the results of operations. The assets held for sale are part of the repurchase of assets from uBriGene (see Note\n6).\n11\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, including tangible assets and other intangible assets with definitive lives, for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducts its\nlong-lived asset impairment analyses in accordance with ASC 360-10, \"Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC 360-10-15\nrequires the Company to group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash\nflows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. If the undiscounted\ncash flows do not indicate the carrying amount of the asset group is recoverable, an impairment charge is measured as the amount by which\nthe carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis or appraisals.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies previously disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were no new accounting pronouncements or updates to recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in\nthe 2023 Form 10-K that affect the Company’s present or future results of operations, overall financial condition, liquidity, or disclosures\nupon adoption.\nNote 3 - Clinical Trial and Sponsored Research Agreements\nResearch and Development Expenses - Sponsored Research and Clinical Trial Agreements\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded the following expenses in research and development\nfor sponsored research and clinical trial agreements in the Unaudited Statements of Operations pursuant to the terms of these agreements:\nFor the three months ended June 30, For the six months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCity of Hope National Medical Center\nIL13Rα2 111 326 391 636\nCS1(1) — 139 — 188\nPSCA(1) — 22 — 44\nFred Hutchinson Cancer Center - CD20 312 544 312 1,098\nSt. Jude Children's Research Hospital - XSCID(2) — 216 (434) 634\nLeiden University Medical Center - RAG1 SCID 121 112 241 224\nMayo Clinic(3) (275) 275 (275) 551\nTotal $ 268 $ 1,634 $ 235 $ 3,375\n(1) Licenses and associated sponsored research agreements were terminated in May 2023.\n(2) License and associated Data Transfer Agreement were terminated in April 2024.\n(3) License and associated sponsored research agreement were terminated in June 2024.\n12\nTable of Contents\nOngoing Clinical Trial and Sponsored Research Agreements\nIL13Rα2 (MB-101) Clinical Research Support Agreements\nSince February 2017, the Company has been party to a clinical research support agreement for the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T program (the\n“IL13Rα2 CRA”) with COH, whereby, the Company has agreed to contribute $0.1 million related to patient costs in connection with the\non-going investigator-initiated study.\nSince October 2020, the Company has been party to a clinical research support agreement for the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T program for\nadult patients with leptomeningeal glioblastoma, ependymoma or medulloblastoma (the “IL13Rα2 Leptomeningeal CRA”) with COH,\nwhereby the Company has agreed to contribute $0.1 million per patient in connection with the ongoing investigator-initiated study.

The plan initially authorized grants to issue up to 133,333 shares of authorized but unissued\ncommon stock, expires 10 years from adoption, and limits the term of each option to no more than 10 years from the date of grant. In June\n2018, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares issuable by\n200,000 shares, for a total of 333,333 shares. In June 2021, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Incentive Plan to\nincrease the number of authorized shares issuable by 200,000 shares, for a total of 533,333 shares. In June 2022, the Company’s\nstockholders approved an amendment to the Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares issuable by 200,000 shares, for a\ntotal of 733,333 shares.\nAs of June 30, 2024, 394,393 shares were available for future issuance under the Incentive Plan.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes stock option activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024:\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nWeighted Average Contractual Life (in\nStock Options Exercise Price years)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023 76,112 $ 85.95 3.31\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024 76,112 $ 85.95 2.81\nOptions vested and exercisable at June 30, 2024 47,570 $ 85.95 2.81\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to options.

In connection with the Company’s\nRegistered Direct Offering on October 26, 2023, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,668,236 shares of common\nstock, and in a concurrent private placement, the Company issued unregistered warrants to purchase up to 2,588,236 shares of common\nstock, and the resale of the underlying shares of common stock were subsequently registered in April 2024 on Form S-1 (File No. 333-\n275997). In connection with these offerings, H.C. Wainwright received Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 155,294 shares of\ncommon stock. In connection with the Public Offering the Company completed in May 2024, the 2,588,236 unregistered warrants were\nrepriced from the original exercise price of $1.58 to $0.237.\nIn connection with the May 2024 Offering, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 15,717,638 shares of common stock\nand issued three series of warrants to purchase up to 50,632,914 shares of common stock. In connection with these offerings, H.C.\nWainwright received Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 1,012,658 shares of common stock.\nIn connection with the Registered Direct Offering, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 3,105,000 shares of common\nstock, and in the concurrent Private Placement, the Company issued unregistered warrants to purchase up to 6,130,000 shares of common\nstock, the resale of the underlying shares of common stock were subsequently registered in July 2024 on Form S-1 (File No. 333-280927).\nIn connection with these offerings, H.C.

Since dividends are declared, paid and set aside among the holders of shares of common stock and Class A\ncommon shares pro-rata on an as-if-converted basis, the two-class method of computing net loss per share is not required. Diluted net loss\nper share does not reflect the effect of shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of warrants or outstanding Class A preferred\nshares, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities\nas having rights that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders. In addition, as our non-pre-funded warrants are\nparticipating securities, we are required to calculate diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method and utilize the most dilutive\nresult. In periods where there is a net loss, no allocation of undistributed net loss to non-pre-funded warrants is performed as the holders of\nour non-pre-funded warrants are not contractually obligated to participate in our losses.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes potentially dilutive securities that were not considered in the computation of diluted net loss per share because\nthey would be anti-dilutive.\nFor the six months ended June 30,\n2024 2023\nWarrants 60,957,004 70,102\nOptions 76,112 76,112\nClass A Preferred Shares 250,000 250,000\nUnvested restricted stock awards 60,111 34,016\nUnvested restricted stock units 14,216 129,476\nTotal 61,357,443 559,706\nNote 11 – Income Taxes\nThe Company incurred net operating losses and recorded a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets for all periods presented.\nAccordingly, the Company has not recorded a provision for federal or state income taxes.\nThe Company is subject to US federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or\nrefundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred\ntax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of Management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of\nthe deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nNote 12 – Commitments and Contingencies\nIndemnification\nIn accordance with its Certificate of Incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and indemnification agreements, the Company has\nindemnification obligations to its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while they are serving at\nthe Company’s request in such capacity.

On June 28, 2024, the\nCompany terminated the lease of its Mercantile Center Facility for a termination fee of $40,000. The Company’s lease liabilities result from\nthe lease of its Plantation Street Facility, which expires in 2026. Such leases do not require any contingent rental payments, impose any\nfinancial restrictions, or contain any residual value guarantees. Certain of the Company’s leases include renewal options and escalation\nclauses; renewal options have not been included in the calculation of the lease liabilities and right of use assets as the Company is not\nreasonably certain to exercise the options. The Company does not act as a lessor or have any leases classified as financing leases.\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company identified triggering events that required an impairment of the asset group consisting of the right-of-use\nasset and associated leasehold improvements. The assessment concluded that impairment existed as of June 30, 2024, and the impairment\nloss was allocated to the leasehold improvements and right-of-use assets based on the relative carrying amounts of the assets (see Note 6).\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had operating lease liabilities of $1.1 million and right of use assets of $0.1 million, which were\nincluded in the Unaudited Balance Sheet.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial\nstatements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nU.S. GAAP. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),\nwhich are often indicated by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “look forward to,”\n“may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions, include, but are not limited to, any\nstatements relating to our growth strategy and product development programs, including the Company’s expectations with respect to the\nconsummation of the sale of its manufacturing facility, the timing of and our ability to make regulatory filings such as Investigational New\nDrug (“IND”) applications and other applications and to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, statements concerning\nthe potential of therapies and product candidates, and any other statements that are not historical facts. All forward-looking statements\nincluded in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such\nforward-looking statements. Our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Actual results could\ndiffer materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the\ninformation set forth under Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” herein.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies into\npotential cures for hematologic cancers and solid tumors. We aim to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring\nan ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the\ntechnologies to market.\nOur pipeline is currently focused in two core areas: CAR T therapies for hematologic malignancies and CAR T therapies for solid tumors.\nFor these therapies we have partnered with world class research institutions, including the City of Hope National Medical Center (“COH”\nor “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“Fred Hutch”), and Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”).\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses for the foreseeable future relating to research, development and commercialization of our potential\nproducts. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional resources when needed, on terms acceptable\nto us, if at all. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited financial statements\ndo not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets that might be necessary despite this uncertainty.\nCAR T Therapies\nOur pipeline of CAR T therapies is being developed under exclusive licenses from several world class research institutions. Our strategy is\nto license these technologies, support preclinical and clinical research activities by our partners and transfer the underlying technology to\nour or our contract manufacturer’s cell processing facility in order to conduct our own clinical trials.\nWe are developing CAR T therapy for hematologic malignancies in partnership with Fred Hutch targeting CD20 (MB-106). In May 2021,\nwe announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application for MB-\n106. As of December 2023, approximately 40 patients have been treated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Fred Hutch\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729), and approximately 20 patients have been treated in the Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by us\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05360238). In 2023, we received Safety Review Committee approval to continue dose escalation in all\nthree active arms of the ongoing Mustang-sponsored Phase 1 trial. We presented the latest results, demonstrating a favorable safety profile,\ncomplete\n25\nTable of Contents\nresponse rate, and durability, from the ongoing Mustang-sponsored Phase 1 trial at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”)\nAnnual Meeting.\nWe are also developing CAR T therapy for solid tumors in partnership with COH targeting IL13Rα2 (MB-101). In addition, we have\npartnered with Nationwide for a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus (MB-108) in order to enhance the activity of MB-\n101 for the treatment of patients with high-grade malignant brain tumors. The Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by COH for MB-101\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02208362) has completed the treatment phase and patients continue to be assessed for long-term safety.\nA Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) for MB-108 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nNCT03657576) began during the third quarter of 2019. In October 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted our IND application for the\ncombination of MB-101 and MB-108 – which is referred to as MB-109 – for the treatment of patients with IL13Rα2+ relapsed or\nrefractory glioblastoma (“GBM”) and high-grade astrocytoma.\nOn May 18, 2023, we announced a series of changes resulting from a review of our portfolio of product candidates to determine the future\nstrategy of our programs and the proper allocation of our resources. Following this review, we determined to discontinue development of\nour MB-102 (CD123), MB-103 (HER2), MB-104 (CS1) and MB-105 (PSCA) programs, all of which were CAR T therapies being\ndeveloped in partnership with City of Hope.\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T cell therapy for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we completed a successful End-of-Phase 1 meeting with the FDA regarding a potential pivotal Phase 2 single-\narm clinical trial for the treatment of WM. Per the discussions, the FDA agreed with the proposed overall design of the pivotal trial for WM\nat the recommended dose of 1 x 107 CAR-T cells/kg and requested only minimal modifications to the study protocol. No additional\nnonclinical studies are expected prior to Phase 2 or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) filing. Due to limited resources, and as a\nresult of the reduction in work force described below, we do not expect to initiate our pivotal Phase 2 single-arm clinical trial of MB-106\nfor the treatment of WM trial in 2024. Subject to available funds, we intend to rely on third party service providers to conduct study and\nmanufacturing services to advance our priority potential product candidates.\nAlso in the first quarter of 2024, we completed enrollment of the indolent lymphoma arm in our multicenter Phase 1 trial. The tenth and\nfinal patient enrolled on that arm was a patient with follicular lymphoma (FL) who achieved a complete response following treatment with\n1 x 107 CAR-T cells/kg. As a result, the overall complete response rate for FL in the Phase 1 portion of this trial was sustained at 100%\n(N=6), with no occurrence of CRS above grade 1 and no ICANS of any grade, despite not using prophylactic tocilizumab or\ndexamethasone.\nIn March 2024, we announced plans to collaborate with Fred Hutch for a proof-of-concept Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial\nevaluating MB-106 in autoimmune diseases.\nIn March 2024, we were granted the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA for the treatment of\nrelapsed or refractory CD20 positive WM and FL, based on potential improvement in response as seen in clinical data to date. Drugs\neligible for RMAT designation are those intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and that\npresent preliminary clinical evidence indicating the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition.\nRMAT designation provides regenerative medicine advanced therapy products with the same benefits to expedite the development and\nreview of a marketing application that are available to drugs that receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation. These advantages include\ntimely advice and interactive communications with FDA, as well as proactive and collaborative involvement by senior FDA managers and\nexperienced review and regulatory health project management staff. A product designated as an RMAT also may be eligible for other FDA-\nexpedited programs, such as Priority Review. The FDA also may conduct a rolling review of products in its expedited programs, reviewing\nportions of a marketing application before the complete application is submitted.\nIn June 2024, we announced that updated data for MB-106 in the Phase 1/2 Fred Hutch investigator-sponsored trial showed a favorable\nsafety and efficacy profile in 10 patients with WM. There was an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 90% with durable responses observed,\nincluding three complete responses (“CR”), two very good partial responses (“VGPR”), and four partial responses (“PR”). One of the\npatients who achieved a CR remained in remission for 31 months, with an\n26\nTable of Contents\nimmunoglobulin M (IgM) level that decreased rapidly to the normal range after treatment with MB-106 and remained normal since.\nPatients had a median of nine prior lines of therapy, and only one patient started additional anti-WM treatment after being treated with MB-\n106. From a safety perspective, CRS occurred in nine patients: five patients with grade 1 and four patients with grade 2. One patient\nexperienced grade 1 ICANS. No grade 3 or 4 CRS or grade 2, 3 or 4 ICANS was observed, despite dose escalation.\nIn May 2024, we informed the clinical sites participating in the Mustang-sponsored Phase 1/2 study in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia, MB106-CD20-001, that we had decided to close the trial. In June 2024, we similarly informed the clinical\nsites participating in the Mustang-sponsored Long-term Follow-up Study in Patients Previously Treated with Mustang Bio, Inc. CAR-T\nCell Investigational Products, MB100-OBS-001, that we had decided to close that trial. As a result, further clinical development of MB-106\nis currently focused solely on autoimmune diseases unless funding and resources become available to restart the program for hematologic\nmalignancies. Planning for the aforementioned Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in autoimmune diseases is in progress, with\ninitiation of the trial planned for the fourth quarter of 2024 and proof-of-concept anticipated in 2025.\nMB-109 (Combination of MB-101 CAR T Therapy with MB-108 Oncolytic Virus Therapy for Malignant Brain Tumors)\nIn October 2023, we received a safe-to-proceed “approval” from the FDA for our MB-109 IND application allowing us to initiate a Phase\n1, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study of MB-109 in patients with IL13Rα2+ recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytoma. In\nthis Phase 1 clinical study, we intend to evaluate the combination of CAR-T cells (MB-101) and the herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic\nvirus (MB-108) in patients with IL13Rα2+ high-grade gliomas. The design of this study involves first a lead-in cohort, wherein patients are\ntreated with MB-101 alone without prior MB-108 administration. After successful confirmation of the safety profile of MB-101 alone, the\nstudy will then investigate increasing doses of intratumorally administered MB-108 followed by dual intratumoral (ICT) and\nintraventricular (ICV) administration of MB-101. Due to limited resources, we do not currently expect to initiate this study until such time,\nif any, that additional resources become available to us.\nTerminated Product Candidates (Gene Therapies and in vivo CAR-T)\nWe previously developed several gene therapy product candidates, which included MB-117 and MB-217 (based on technologies licensed\nfrom St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (“St. Jude”)) and MB-110 (based on technologies licensed from Leiden University Medical\nCentre (“LUMC”)). In April 2024, we entered into a termination and release agreement with St. Jude, pursuant to which we agreed to\nterminate the license agreement underpinning the MB-117 and MB-217 product candidates in exchange for a mutual release of liability and\nforgiveness by St. Jude of all amounts previously owing to them. Also in April 2024, we delivered a termination notice to LUMC pursuant\nto which we terminated the license agreement underpinning the MB-110 product candidate; we are currently in discussions with LUMC\nregarding the terms that will govern such termination. In June 2024, we also agreed with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and\nResearch (“Mayo Clinic”) to terminate the license agreement underpinning our (now former) preclinical in vivo CAR-T program, together\nwith a related sponsored research agreement, in exchange for a mutual release of liability and forgiveness by Mayo Clinic of all amounts\npreviously owed to them.\nTo date, we have not received approval for the sale of any of our product candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any\nproduct sales from our product candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to\ncontinue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.\nRecent Developments\nApril 2024 Reduction in Work Force\nOn April 10, 2024, our board of directors approved a reduction of our workforce by approximately 81% of our employee base in order to\nreduce costs and preserve capital due to the fundraising environment and continued uncertainty regarding the CFIUS review of the sale of\nthe Facility and the Transaction with uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“uBriGene”). The workforce reduction\ntook place primarily in April 2024 and was completed in the second\n27\nTable of Contents\nquarter of 2024. As a result of these actions, we incurred personnel-related restructuring charges of approximately $0.2 million in\nconnection with one-time employee termination cash expenditures, which were incurred in the second quarter of 2024.\nSale of Manufacturing Facility – Overview of Transaction\nOn May 18, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene, pursuant to\nwhich we agreed to sell our leasehold interest in our cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts (the “Facility”), and\nassociated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to uBriGene (the “Transaction”). We\nand uBriGene subsequently entered into Amendment No. 1, dated as of June 29, 2023, and Amendment No. 2, dated as of July 28, 2023, to\nthe Original Asset Purchase Agreement (the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, as so amended, the “Prior Asset Purchase Agreement”).\nOn July 28, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, we completed the sale of all of our assets that\nprimarily relate to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (such operations, the “Transferred\nOperations” and such assets, the “Transferred Assets”) to uBriGene for upfront consideration of $6 million cash (the “Base Amount”). The\nTransferred Assets that were transferred to uBriGene on the Closing Date include, but are not limited to: (i) our leases of equipment and\nother personal property and all other property, equipment, machinery, tools, supplies, inventory, fixtures and all other personal property\nprimarily related to the Transferred Operations, (ii) the data, information, methods, quality management systems, and intellectual property\nprimarily used for the purposes of the Transferred Operations, (iii) the records and filings, including customer and vendor lists, production\ndata, standard operating procedures and business records relating to, used in or arising under the Transferred Operations and (iv) all\ntransferrable business license, permits and approvals necessary to operate the Transferred Operations. Certain Transferred Assets, including\nour lease of the Facility and contracts that are primarily used in the Transferred Operations (the “Transferred Contracts”) did not transfer to\nuBriGene on the Closing Date.\nVoluntary Notice to U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\nuBriGene is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UBrigene (Jiangsu) Biosciences Co., Ltd., a Chinese contract development and\nmanufacturing organization. Under the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to\nobtain clearance for the Transaction from the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), although obtaining\nsuch clearance was not a condition to closing the Transaction. In accordance with the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene\npreviously submitted a voluntary joint notice to CFIUS on August 10, 2023.\nFollowing an initial 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period, on November 13, 2023, CFIUS requested that we\nand uBriGene withdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature and extent\nof national security risk posed by the Transaction. Upon CFIUS’s request, we and uBriGene submitted a request to withdraw and re-file our\njoint voluntary notice to CFIUS, and on November 13, 2023, CFIUS granted this request, accepted the joint voluntary notice and\ncommenced a new 45-day review period on November 14, 2023. CFIUS’s 45-day review ended on December 28, 2023. Since CFIUS had\nnot concluded its review by December 28, 2023, the proceeding transitioned to a subsequent 45-day investigation period, which ended on\nFebruary 12, 2024.\nFollowing the 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period described above, on February 12, 2024, we and uBriGene\nrequested permission to withdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature\nand extent of national security risk posed by the Transaction. Upon our joint request to withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to\nCFIUS, on February 12, 2024, CFIUS granted this request, accepted the joint voluntary notice and commenced a new 45-day review period\non February 13, 2024. CFIUS’s new 45-day review ended on March 28, 2024. Because CFIUS had not yet concluded its action, the\nproceeding transitioned to a second 45-day phase as CFIUS further investigated the Transaction. On March 28, 2024, CFIUS advised us\nthat its investigation would be completed no later than May 13, 2024.\nOn May 13, 2024, together with uBriGene and CFIUS, we executed a National Security Agreement (the “NSA”), pursuant to which we and\nuBriGene agreed to abandon the Transaction and all other transactions contemplated by the Asset\n28\nTable of Contents\nPurchase Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith. The execution of the NSA was the result of CFIUS’\ndetermination that such transactions posed a risk to the national security of the United States. We disagree with this position but did not feel\na meaningful likelihood existed that the Transaction would be consummated in light of CFIUS’ objections. The NSA imposes certain\nconditions on us and uBriGene and its affiliates. Most significantly, we agreed (i) not to effect the Transaction with uBriGene or any of its\naffiliates; and (ii) to appoint a point of contact representative with whom CFIUS and uBriGene’s designated contact person may interact as\nneeded. The NSA also obligates uBriGene to sell, or otherwise dispose of, the equipment assets purchased within 180 days after the\nexecution of the NSA, with uBriGene able to eliminate some of its obligations under the NSA if it is able to sell the equipment assets\npurchased back to us within 45 days after the execution of the NSA (an “Expedited Divestment”).\nJune 2024 Repurchase of Assets\nOn June 27, 2024 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene,\npursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to repurchase (the “Repurchase Transaction”) the assets,\nproperties and rights previously transferred by the Company to uBriGene under the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement, excluding any\ninventory transferred under the Purchase Agreement that has been consumed or transferred to a third party by uBriGene since the closing of\nthe Prior Asset Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “Repurchased Assets”). For the avoidance of doubt, “Repurchased Assets” also\nincludes all Mustang Assets (as such term is defined in the NSA) that were previously sold, transferred, conveyed, assigned, delivered, or\ncontributed by us or our affiliates to uBriGene or its affiliates, to the extent such assets have not been consumed or transferred to a third\nparty by uBriGene since the closing of the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement. The Repurchased Assets do not include inventory acquired by\nuBriGene after the closing of the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement. We further agreed to assume all obligations, liabilities and commitments\npreviously transferred by us to uBriGene under the Prior Asset Purchase Agreement. The Repurchase Transaction was intended to\nconstitute an Expedited Divestment by uBriGene pursuant to the NSA with CFIUS.\nAs consideration for the Repurchase Transaction, we agreed to pay to uBriGene a total purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) of $1,395,138,\nconsisting of (i) an upfront payment of $100,000 due within five (5) business days of the Effective Date and a (ii) subsequent amount of\n$1,295,138 due on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Closing (the “Deferred Amount”). In the event that as of the original (or any\nextended) date on which the Deferred Amount is payable we have, as of the date of the public reporting of our then-most recent quarterly\naudited or unaudited financial statements, net assets below $20 million, then we may, upon written notice to uBriGene, elect to delay our\npayment obligation of the Deferred Amount by an additional six (6) months, with no limit on the number of such extensions available to us.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if we have not paid the Deferred Amount in full as of the date that is 12 (twelve) months after closing of the\nRepurchase Transaction, any amounts that remain outstanding will accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum beginning on the date that is\n12 (twelve) months after closing and until the Deferred Amount is paid in full.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both us and uBriGene with respect to each party.\nAdditionally, we agreed to provide a purchase price allocation schedule to uBriGene within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date.\nPursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene terminated the following agreements between us that were\nentered into in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement: (i) the Manufacturing Services Agreement, dated July 28, 2023, and work\norders entered into under such agreement, (ii) the Quality Services Agreement, dated July 28, 2023, (iii) the Subcontracting CDMO\nAgreement, dated July 28, 2023, and work orders entered into under such agreement, (iv) the Quality Services Agreement, dated July 28,\n2023, and (v) the Transition Services Agreement.\nNotification of Non-Compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements\nOn March 13, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Letter”) from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of The Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for\ncontinued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires companies\nlisted on the Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). As\nof December 31, 2023, we reported stockholders’ equity\n29\nTable of Contents\nof $123,000, and as of June 30, 2024, we reported negative stockholders’ equity of $ ($8.3) million. The Letter further noted that as of its\ndate, we did not have a market value of listed securities of $35 million, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most\nrecently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for\ncontinued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe Letter had no immediate effect on our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to our compliance with the other\ncontinued listing requirements. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, we were provided 45 calendar days, or until April 29, 2024, to submit a\nplan to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”). We submitted our Compliance Plan on April 29, 2024, and the Staff granted our\nrequest for an extension of 180 calendar days through September 9, 2024, to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement.\nOn May 16, 2024, we received a notice (the “Second Letter”) from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that the bid price of our common stock\nhad closed below $1.00 per share for 31 consecutive business days and, as a result, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2), which sets forth the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Second Letter\nfrom Nasdaq had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we\nwere afforded a 180-calendar day grace period, or until November 12, 2024, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement.\nCompliance can be achieved by evidencing a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days\n(but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the 180-calendar day grace period.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the bid price requirement by November 12, 2024, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar\nday compliance period so long as we satisfy the criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq and the continued listing requirement for market value\nof publicly held shares and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period\nby effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. In the event we are not eligible for the second grace period, Nasdaq staff will provide written\nnotice that our common stock is subject to delisting; however, we may request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”),\nwhich request, if timely made, would stay any further suspension or delisting action by the Staff pending the conclusion of the hearing\nprocess and expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in our\nefforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nFinancing Activities\nMay 2024 Public Offering\nOn April 29, 2024, we commenced a best efforts public offering with an institutional investor (the “Investor”) (the “May 2024 Offering”)\nof an aggregate of (i) 1,160,000 shares of common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “May 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase up to\nan aggregate of 15,717,638 shares of common stock (the “May 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant Shares”), (iii) Series A-1 warrants (the “Series A-\n1 Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of common stock (the “Series A-1 Warrant Shares”), (iv) Series A-2\nwarrants (the “Series A-2 Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of common stock (the “Series A-2 Warrant\nShares”), and (v) Series A-3 warrants (the “Series A-3 Warrants,” and together with the Series A-1 Warrants and Series A-2 Warrants, the\n“Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 16,877,638 shares of common stock (the “Series A-3 Warrant Shares”). Each share of\ncommon stock or May 2024 Pre-Funded Warrant was sold together with one Series A-1 Warrant to purchase one share of common stock,\none Series A-2 Warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and one Series A-3 Warrant to purchase one share of common stock. The\npublic offering price for each share of common stock and accompanying Warrants was $0.237, and the public offering price for each May\n2024 Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying Warrants was $0.2369. The May 2024 Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of\n$0.0001 per share, were exercisable immediately and will expire when exercised in full. Each Warrant has an exercise price of $0.237 per\nshare, will be exercisable beginning on the effective date of stockholder approval of the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the\nWarrants (the “Warrant Stockholder Approval”), which was obtained on June 27, 2024. The Series A-1 Warrant will expire on the five-year\nanniversary of the Warrant Stockholder Approval. The Series A-2 Warrant will expire on the twenty-four-month anniversary of the Warrant\nStockholder Approval. The Series A-3 Warrant will expire on the nine-month anniversary of the Warrant Stockholder Approval.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe net proceeds of the May 2024 Offering, after deducting the fees and expenses of the Placement Agent (as defined below), described in\nmore detail below, and other offering expenses payable by us, but excluding the net proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the Warrants, was\napproximately $3.2 million. The May 2024 Offering closed on May 2, 2024.\nIn connection with the May 2024 Offering, we also entered into a warrant amendment agreement (the “Warrant Amendment Agreement”)\nwith the Investor. Under the Warrant Amendment Agreement, we agreed to amend certain existing warrants to purchase up to 2,588,236\nshares of common stock that were previously issued in October 2023 to the Investor, with an exercise price of $1.58 per share (the\n“Existing Warrants”), in consideration for their purchase of the securities in the May 2024 Offering, as follows: (i) lower the exercise price\nof the Existing Warrants to $0.237 per share, (ii) provide that the Existing Warrants, as amended, will not be exercisable until the receipt of\nWarrant Stockholder Approval for the exercisability of the Warrants in the May 2024 Offering, and (iii) extend the original expiration date\nof the Existing Warrants by five years following the receipt of such Warrant Stockholder Approval. The Warrant Amendment Agreement\nbecame effective on May 2, 2024.\nJune 2024 Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent Private Placement of Warrants (the “June 2024 Offering”)\nOn June 19, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “June 2024 SPA”) with an institutional accredited investor,\npursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under the rules of Nasdaq (the “Registered\nDirect Offering”), (i) 3,025,000 shares of common stock, at a price per Share of $0.41 and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-Funded\nWarrants”) to purchase up to 3,105,000 shares of our common stock, at a price per Pre-Funded Warrant equal to $0.4099, the price per\nshare of common stock, less $0.0001.\nThe Pre-Funded Warrants were sold, in lieu of shares of common stock, to the investor, whose purchase of shares of common stock in the\nRegistered Direct Offering would otherwise result in the investor, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning\nmore than 4.99% (or, at the investor’s option upon issuance, 9.99%) of our outstanding common stock immediately following the\ncompletion of the Registered Direct Offering. The Pre-Funded Warrants have an exercise price of $0.0001 per share, became exercisable\nupon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full.\nThe Registered Direct Offering closed on June 21, 2024. We intend to use the net proceeds of approximately $2.1 million from the\nRegistered Direct Offering for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements.\nIn a concurrent private placement, pursuant to the terms of the June 2024 SPA, we also agreed to issue and sell to the investor unregistered\nwarrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to purchase up to 6,130,000 shares of common stock, at an offering price of $0.41 per Private\nPlacement Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the “Private Placement” and, together with the Registered Direct Offering, the\n“Offerings”) (which offering price was included in the purchase price per share of common stock or Pre-Funded Warrant). The Private\nPlacement Warrants have an exercise price of $0.41 per share (subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Private Placement\nWarrants), were exercisable upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance. The Private Placement Warrants contain\ncustomary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including for share splits, share dividends, rights offering and pro rata\ndistributions. The Private Placement Warrants were subsequently registered in July 2024 on Form S-1 (File No. 333-280927).\nH.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”) acted as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the Offerings under an\nEngagement Letter, dated as of June 18, 2024, between us and Wainwright (the “Engagement Letter”). Pursuant to the Engagement Letter,\nwe issued to Wainwright (or its designees) warrants to purchase up to 367,800 shares of common stock (the “Wainwright Warrants” and,\ntogether with the Private Placement Warrants, the “2024 Warrants”). The Wainwright Warrants have substantially the same terms as the\nPrivate Placement Warrants, except that the Wainwright Warrants will expire five years from the commencement of the sales of the\nOfferings and have an exercise price of $0.5125 per share (subject to customary adjustment as set forth in the Wainwright Warrants),\nrepresenting 125% of the purchase price per share of common stock in the Registered Direct Offering.\n31\nTable of Contents\nMay 2024 At the Market Offering Agreement\nOn May 31, 2024, we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Wainwright (the “Manager”) under\nwhich we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock (the “ATM Shares”), through or to the\nManager. The offer and sale, if any, of ATM Shares by us under the Offering Agreement will be made pursuant to our registration statement\non Form S-3 (File No. 333-279891) (the “Registration Statement”) under the Securities Act, and the related prospectus included therein,\nfiled with the SEC on May 31, 2024, and declared effective on June 12, 2024.\nUnder the ATM Agreement, the Manager may sell ATM Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market offering”\nas defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act. The Manager will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ATM Shares from\ntime to time, based upon instructions from us (including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may\nimpose). We will pay the Manager a commission of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sales of ATM Shares sold through the Manager\nunder the ATM Agreement and have provided the Manager with customary indemnification and contribution rights. We will also reimburse\nthe Manager for certain expenses incurred in connection with the ATM Agreement. The Company and the Manager may each terminate the\nATM Agreement at any time upon specified prior written notice.\nThe offering of ATM Shares pursuant to the ATM Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all ATM Shares subject to the\nATM Agreement or (ii) the termination of the ATM Agreement in accordance with its terms.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, no shares of common stock were issued under the ATM Agreement.\nThe amount of securities we are able to sell pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-3 is limited. See “Risk Factors” and\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nTermination of 2018 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement\nOn May 31, 2024, we delivered notice to B. Riley Securities, Inc. (formerly B. Riley FBR, Inc.), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., and the Manager\n(collectively, the “Agents”) to terminate our At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, dated July 27, 2018, as amended on July 20, 2020,\nDecember 31, 2020, and April 14, 2023 (collectively, the “2018 Sales Agreement”), with the Agents. Termination of the 2018 Sales\nAgreement was effective June 5, 2024, pursuant to Section 13(b) of the 2018 Sales Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the 2018 Sales Agreement, we were previously able to issue and sell, from time to time through or to the Agents,\nshares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $100,000,000, subject to the limitations of Instruction I.B.6 of\nForm S-3. As a result of the termination of the 2018 Sales Agreement, we will not issue or sell any additional shares of our common stock\nunder the 2018 Sales Agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which we have\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Applying these principles requires our judgment\nin determining the appropriateness of acceptable accounting principles and methods of application in diverse and complex economic\nactivities. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nexpenses, assets and liabilities, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience\nand other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions.\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the MD&A in the 2023 Form 10-K. There were no material changes in our critical\naccounting estimates or accounting policies from December 31, 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAccounting Pronouncements\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no new accounting pronouncements or updates to recently issued accounting\npronouncements disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K that are expected to materially affect the Company’s present or future financial\nstatements.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” within the meaning of federal securities laws, meaning that the market value of our shares held by\nnon-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year.\nWe may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $250\nmillion or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our\nshares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most recent\nfiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive\ncompensation and certain other matters, and smaller reporting companies are permitted to delay adoption of certain recent accounting\npronouncements discussed in Note 2 to our financial statements in this Form 10-Q.\nControlled Company Status\nWe are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress. As a “Controlled Company” we rely on the exemption provided by Nasdaq Listing\nRule 5615(c)(2), which permits us to maintain less than a majority of independent directors on our board.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the three months ended June 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 4,360 $ 10,836 $ (6,476) (60)%\nAsset impairment 2,649 — 2,649 100%\nGeneral and administrative 1,531 3,055 (1,524) (50)%\nTotal operating expenses 8,540 13,891 (5,351) (39)%\nLoss from operations (8,540) (13,891) 5,351 (39)%\nOther income (expense)\nOther income 314 429 (115) (27)%\nInterest income 29 159 (130) (82)%\nInterest expense (2) (2,932) 2,930 (100)%\nTotal other income (expense) 341 (2,344) 2,685 (115)%\nNet Loss $ (8,199) $ (16,235) $ 8,036 (49)%\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license, sponsored research and milestone costs related to in-\nlicensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations (“CROs”) for preclinical and clinical\nstudies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated\nwith regulatory filings, laboratory costs and other supplies.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were $4.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively.\nThe decrease of approximately $6.4 million is primarily attributed to decreased expenses of $5.1\n33\nTable of Contents\nmillion for personnel related costs, which includes approximately $0.6 million of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting agreement\nwith uBriGene and the reversal of $1.3 million of 2023 accrued bonus that will not be paid due to the reduction in the workforce that\noccurred in April 2024, $2.9 million for lab supplies, which includes approximately $0.1 million of costs reimbursed through the\nsubcontracting agreement with uBriGene, $0.6 million for program related expenses, which includes approximately $0.3 million\nforgiveness of payables to the Mayo Clinic as a result of the mutual termination of the license agreement, $0.6 million for facility and\ndeprecation expenses, which includes approximately $0.2 million of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting agreement with\nuBriGene, and $0.9 million for consulting expenses, offset by $3.7 million higher other expenses, of which approximately $3.2 million of\nexpenses incurred related to the June 2024 Repurchase of Assets from uBriGene.\nThe following table provides a breakout of the components of research and development expenses for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the three months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nR&D program related expenses (1)\nMB-102 $ - $ 69\nMB-106 514 945\nMB-107/207 (2) - (912)\nMB-109 130 358\nMB-110 121 112\nMayo in situ CAR T (300) 282\nAll others (3) 8 221\nTotal R&D development expense 473 1,075\nR&D personnel related expenses (4) (449) 4,610\nR&D facility and depreciation expense 300 892\nR&D consulting expenses 74 977\nR&D lab supplies (12) 2,946\nR&D other expense (5) 3,974 336\nTotal research and development expense $ 4,360 $ 10,836\n(1) Includes sponsored research, license and clinical trial related costs.\n(2) Credit for the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflects the refunds and credit memos received upon the termination services for the\nMB-107/207 program.\n(3) Includes costs for long-term follow-up and programs that were terminated.\n(4) Credit for the three months ended June 30, 2024, reflects the reversal of stock-based compensation expense due to the forfeitures of\nrestricted stock units related to the reduction in the workforce in April 2024.\n(5) Includes approximately $3.2 million of expenses incurred related to the June 2024 Repurchase of Assets from uBriGene.\nAsset Impairment\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred impairment charges of $2.6 million attributable to our assessment of the\nrecoverability of the asset group consisting of leasehold improvements and associated right-of-use asset. No impairment was recorded in\nthe three months ended June 30, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for executives\nand other administrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including investor relations, legal\nactivities including patent fees, and facilities-related expenses.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, general and administrative expenses were $1.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nThe decrease of approximately $1.6 million is primarily attributed to a $0.5 million decrease in personnel costs, $0.8 million decrease in\nlegal and patent protection expenses, and $0.2 million decrease in professional\n34\nTable of Contents\nservices, $0.2 million decrease in consulting, and a $0.1 million decrease across various other general and administrative expenses, offset\nby $0.2 million increase in the equity fee to Fortress, in connection with the financings.\nOther Income or Expense\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, other income (expense) was $0.3 million and $(2.3) million, respectively. The\nincrease of approximately $2.7 million in income is primarily attributed to a $2.9 million decrease in interest expense, related to the\nrepayment of the Term Loan, partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in other income and a $0.1 million decrease in interest income.\nComparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the six months ended June 30, Change\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 8,164 $ 24,836 $ (16,672) (67)%\nAsset impairment 2,649 — 2,649 100%\nGeneral and administrative 2,958 5,376 (2,418) (45)%\nTotal operating expenses 13,771 30,212 (16,441) (54)%\nLoss from operations (13,771) (30,212) 16,441 (54)%\nOther income (expense)\nOther income 314 780 (466) (60)%\nInterest income 70 612 (542) (89)%\nInterest expense (3) (4,108) 4,105 (100)%\nTotal other income (expense) 381 (2,716) 3,097 (114)%\nNet Loss $ (13,390) $ (32,928) $ 19,538 (59)%\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license, sponsored research and milestone costs related to in-\nlicensed products and technology, payments made to third party contract research organizations (“CROs”) for preclinical and clinical\nstudies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated\nwith regulatory filings, laboratory costs and other supplies.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, research and development expenses were $8.2 million and $24.8 million, respectively.\nThe decrease of approximately $16.6 million is primarily attributed to decreased expenses of $10.9 million for personnel related costs,\nreflecting decreased headcount and includes approximately $2.9 million of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting agreement with\nuBriGene and the reversal of $1.3 million of 2023 accrued bonus that will not be paid due to the reduction in the workforce that occurred in\nApril 2024, $4.9 million for lab supplies, which includes approximately $0.1 million of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting\nagreement with uBriGene, $2.4 million for program related expenses, which includes approximately $0.6 million forgiveness of payables\nto St. Jude as a result of the mutual termination of the license agreement and $0.3 million forgiveness of payables to the Mayo Clinic as a\nresult of the termination of the license agreement, $1.4 million for facility and deprecation expenses, which includes approximately $0.4\nmillion of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting agreement with uBriGene, and $1.2 million for consulting expenses, offset by\napproximately $4.0 million increase in other expenses, of which approximately $3.2 million of expenses incurred related to the June 2024\nRepurchase of Assets from uBriGene.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a breakout of the components of research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024\nand 2023:\nFor the six months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nR&D program related expenses (1)\nMB-102 $ (2) $ 110\nMB-106 1,567 2,126\nMB-107/207 (2) (562) (472)\nMB-109 403 675\nMB-110 241 224\nMayo in situ CAR T (294) 582\nAll others (3) 8 494\nTotal R&D development expense 1,361 3,739\nR&D personnel related expenses (4) (1,138) 9,715\nR&D facility and depreciation expense 659 2,065\nR&D consulting expenses 758 1,930\nR&D lab supplies 183 5,109\nR&D other expense (5) 6,341 2,278\nTotal research and development expense $ 8,164 $ 24,836\n(1) Includes sponsored research, license and clinical trial related costs.\n(2) Credit for the six months ended June 30, 2024, reflects the forgiveness of outstanding payables and accrued expenses due to the mutual\ntermination of the license agreement and related data transfer agreement with St. Jude.\n(3) Includes costs for long-term follow up and programs that were terminated.\n(4) Credit for the six months ended June 30, 2024, reflects the reversal of 2023 accrued bonus that will not be paid due to the reduction in\nthe workforce in April 2024.\n(5) Includes approximately $3.2 million of expenses incurred related to the June 2024 Repurchase of Assets from uBriGene.\nAsset Impairment\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred impairment charges of $2.6 million attributable to our assessment of the\nrecoverability of the asset group consisting of leasehold improvements and associated right-of-use asset. No impairment was recorded in\nthe six months ended June 30, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for executives\nand other administrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including investor relations, legal\nactivities including patent fees, and facilities-related expenses.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, general and administrative expenses were $3.0 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nThe decrease of approximately $2.4 million is primarily attributed to a $1.0 million decrease in personnel costs, $1.0 million decrease in\nlegal and patent protection expenses, $0.2 million decrease in consulting expenses, $0.1 million decrease in professional services. and a\n$0.3 million decrease across various other general and administrative expenses, offset by $0.2 million increase in the equity fee to Fortress,\nin connection with the financings.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOther Income or Expense\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, other income (expense) was $0.4 million and $(2.7) million, respectively. The increase\nof approximately $3.1 million in income is primarily attributed to a $4.1 million decrease in interest expense, related to the repayment of\nthe Term Loan, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in other income and a $0.5 million decrease in interest income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and\nmay never become profitable. As of June 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $394.4 million.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity. For example, on May 2, 2024, we completed the May 2024\nOffering and on June 21, 2024, we completed the June 2024 Offering (together the “Offerings”) described in “Financing Activities” above.\nThe net proceeds of the Offerings, after deducting the fees and expenses of the placement agent and other offering expenses payable by us,\nbut excluding the net proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants, were approximately $5.3 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from\nthe Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 million. On April 10, 2024, our Board approved a reduction in our\nworkforce of approximately 81%, in order to reduce costs and preserve capital due to the fundraising environment and continued\nuncertainty regarding the CFIUS review of the sale of the Facility and the Transaction with uBriGene. The reduction occurred primarily in\nApril 2024 and was completed in the second quarter. Additionally in April 2024, we terminated our license agreements with St. Jude and\nLeiden University Medical Centre. The mutual termination of the St. Jude license and associated Data Transfer Agreement included the\nforgiveness of outstanding amounts owed by us. In June 2024, we terminated our license agreement with the Mayo Clinic, which included\nthe forgiveness of the outstanding amounts owed by us of approximately $0.3 million. In June 2024, we also terminated the sublease of the\nMercantile Center Facility. Based on our current operating plan, reflecting these changes described above, we currently expect that such\ncash and cash equivalents, together with the approximately $5.3 million net proceeds received in the Offerings described above, will be\nsufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2024. We will continue to seek additional funding through corporate partnerships\nand capital markets fundraising. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements.”\nThe continuation of our business as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional capital and eventually attaining and maintaining\nprofitable operations. As of June 30, 2024, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months\nfrom the date of issuance of these unaudited financial statements. The financial statements included in this Form 10-Q do not include any\nadjustments that might be necessary should operations discontinue.\nIn addition, the amount of proceeds we may be able to raise pursuant to our existing shelf registration statements on Form S-3 may be\nlimited. As of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we are subject to General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 known as the “baby shelf rules.” Under\nthese instructions, the amount of funds we can raise through primary offerings of securities in any 12-month period using our registration\nstatements on Form S-3 is limited to one-third of the aggregate market value of the shares of our common stock held by our non-affiliates.\nTherefore, we will be limited in the amount of proceeds we are able to raise by selling securities using our Form S-3 until such time as our\npublic float exceeds $75 million.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with licensors, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and other\nthird parties for the procurement of various products and services, including without limitation biopharmaceutical development, biologic\nassay development, commercialization, clinical and preclinical development, clinical trials management, pharmacovigilance and\nmanufacturing and supply. These contracts typically do not contain minimum purchase commitments and are generally terminable by us\nupon written notice. Payments due upon termination or cancelation/delay consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred,\nincluding non-cancelable obligations\n37\nTable of Contents\nof our service providers, up to the date of cancellation; in certain cases, our contractual arrangements with CROs and CMOs include\ncancelation and/or delay fees and penalties.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments, as\ndescribed in our 2023 Form 10-K. See above for recent terminations of our agreements with St. Jude and LUMC in April 2024 and the\nMayo Clinic in June 2024.\nCash Flows for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nFor the six months ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (7,656) $ (30,200)\nInvesting activities — (34)\nFinancing activities 5,315 (30,287)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (2,341) $ (60,521)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $7.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to $30.2 million for the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to approximately $13.4 million in net loss,\npartially offset by $5.7 million of non-cash items, primarily related to the $2.6 million asset impairment charge, and a $3.1 million change\nin operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to approximately $32.9 million in net loss\nand $1.8 million change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $0.3 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, $1.3\nmillion of depreciation, $2.8 million due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, and $0.1 million from other operating activities.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, no cash was used in or provided by investing activities.

OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock or any other type of equity or debt securities we may offer (together, our “Securities”) involves a high\ndegree of risk. The following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained\nin forward-looking statements we have made in this Form 10-Q and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider\nthe risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial\nstatements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” before\nmaking an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks\nand uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived\nby us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations. Some of the statements in the\nfollowing risk factors constitute forward-looking statements. Please see the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking\nStatements.”\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or\nmaintain profitability. We do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any\nrevenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.\nWe have a limited operating history. We have focused primarily on organizing, acquiring and developing and securing our proprietary\ntechnology and identifying and obtaining preclinical data for various product candidates, with the goal of supporting regulatory approval\nfor these product candidates. We have incurred losses since our inception in March 2015. Our net losses were $13.4 million and $32.9\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $394.4 million as of\nJune 30, 2024. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. We also do not anticipate that we will\nachieve profitability for a period of time after generating material revenues, if ever. If we are unable to generate revenues, we will not\nbecome profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\n39\nTable of Contents\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or\namount of increased expenses or when or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter\nto quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:\n● one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and are approved for commercial sale, due to our need to\nestablish the necessary commercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product candidate without substantial delays,\nincluding hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing,\ndistribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;\n● we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n● there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;\n● we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements that require us to make payments to collaborators or licensors;\n● there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n● there are any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits in which we may become involved; and\n● there are any regulatory developments affecting product candidates of our competitors.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our\ndevelopment stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a\nnumber of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n● obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or\nacquire;\n● manufacture or have manufactured commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product\ncandidate, if approved, at acceptable cost levels; and\n● develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our\nproduct candidates or any future product candidate, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to\nbecome and remain profitable would depress the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business,\nmaintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of\nour Company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Securities.\nThere is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional funding (which may\nnot be available on acceptable terms to us, or at all) and/or delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other\noperations. If we are unable to raise capital, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely\nresult in our securityholders losing some or all of their investment in us.\nWe are currently advancing our programs in hematologic cancers and solid tumors through clinical development. Developing and\ncommercializing CAR T products is expensive, and we do not expect to generate meaningful product revenues in the foreseeable future\nuntil we obtain marketing approval for products in the United States and following any potential commercial launch.\n40\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were $4.3 million. Based on our current business plan, there is substantial doubt\nregarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that our financial statements for the year ended\nJune 30, 2024, are issued. Our fundraising efforts to raise additional funding may divert our management from their day-to-day activities,\nwhich may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our potential products following marketing approval if and when\nobtained. In addition, we cannot guarantee that financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nMoreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional\nsecurities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of\nadditional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. Potential indebtedness, if incurred, would result in increased\nfixed payment obligations, and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur\nadditional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could\nadversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative\npartners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our\ntechnologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results and prospects.\nIn addition, in order to address our current funding constraints, we may be required to further revise our business plan and strategy, which\nmay result in us (i) further curtailing, delaying or discontinuing one or more of our research or development programs or the\ncommercialization of any product candidates, (ii) selling certain of our assets and/or (iii) may result in our being unable to expand our\noperations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities. Such actions may become necessary whether or not we are able to raise\nadditional capital. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. Furthermore, if we\nare unable to raise capital, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our\nsecurityholders losing some or all of their investment in us.\nOur short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe have been conducting operations only since our incorporation in March 2015. Our operations to date have been limited. We have not\nyet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a clinical scale or commercial\nscale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product\ncommercialization. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history\nof successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, as a young business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown\nfactors. We will need to expand our capabilities to support commercial activities. We may not be successful in adding such capabilities.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to\na variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any past quarterly period as\nan indication of future operating performance.\nWe will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the\nnecessary additional capital, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or\ncontinue our development programs.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We will need to significantly increase our spending to advance\nthe preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we may\nreceive regulatory approval, including building our own commercial organizations to address certain markets. We will require substantial\nadditional capital for the further development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates, as well as to fund our other\noperating expenses and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2024, we had $4.6 million in cash and restricted cash and have not generated\npositive cash flows from operations. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise funds to complete the development of\nour product\n41\nTable of Contents\ncandidates. Additionally, if we are unable to secure additional funding, it is likely that we will need to delay or terminate the development\nof certain product candidates; any such delay or termination, or the announcement of any such delay or termination, may impact our\npotential growth and have a material adverse effect on the value of our Securities.\nIn order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing and may choose\nto raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements, public or private equity or debt financing, bank lines of\ncredit, asset sales, government grants, or other arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable\nterms, or at all. Additional funding may be more difficult to obtain, or may be more expensive, as a result of recent increases in inflation\nand interest rates in the U.S. economy generally. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to\nus, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or, if approved, commercialization of one or more of our\nproduct candidates. We may also seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than\notherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available. Any of these events could significantly\nharm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, timing, design and conduct of, and results from, preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates, and any costs associated with such\ndelays;\n● the costs of establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute our product candidates;\n● the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics\nLicense Application (“BLA”) for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we\nmay need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;\n● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with\nour product candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;\n● the cost and timing of securing sufficient supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturers for clinical trials and\nin preparation for commercialization;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish;\n● if one or more of our product candidates are approved, the potential that we may be required to file a lawsuit to defend our patent\nrights or regulatory exclusivities from challenges by companies seeking to market generic versions of one or more of our product\ncandidates;\n● the success of the commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, if approved;\n● the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property\nrights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n● macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, liquidity constraints, failures and instability in U.S. and\ninternational financial banking systems, supply disruptions due to political unrest, conflict and war or other factors, and\npandemics.\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so\nlong as our public float remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public\n42\nTable of Contents\nofferings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration statements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public\nfloat, which is referred to as the “baby shelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to use the highest closing sales price of our common stock\n(or the average of the last bid and last ask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days of sales under the registration statement\nto calculate our public float.\nAs of the date of the 2023 Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of the 2023 Form\n10-K, and until we again have a public float with a value in excess of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to\none-third of our public float under shelf registration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of\nsecurities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statements will also decrease.\nOur inability to raise capital when needed would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause our stock\nvalue to decline or require that we wind down our operations altogether.\nRaising additional capital, including through lending arrangements, may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our\noperations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of\nequity offerings, debt financings, grants and license and development agreements in connection with any collaborations. To the extent that\nwe raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of\nthese securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, including\nthrough lending arrangements, and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or\nrestricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third\nparties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or\ngrant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when\nneeded, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights\nto develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required\nto devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”), as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose\nvarious requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls\nand appropriate corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a\nsubstantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial\ncompliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more\ndifficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits\nand coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract\nand retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols and procedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting\nto allow management to report on the effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These efforts\nto comply with Section 404 and related regulations have required, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and\nmanagerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our internal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of\nSection 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test the effectiveness of our control systems in\nthe future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory\n43\nTable of Contents\nauthorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our\ninternal controls, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make\nour common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that\nour voting and non-voting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second\nfiscal quarter, or our annual revenues are more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-\nvoting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.\nSmaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosure, are exempt from the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404, and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, being required to\nprovide only two years of audited financial statements and not being required to provide selected financial data, supplemental financial\ninformation or risk factors.\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced reporting obligations available to us. We cannot predict whether investors will\nfind our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result,\nthere may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile.\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be\nsubject to limitation.\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections\n382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a\ngreater than 50-percentage- point cumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year\nperiod), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or\ntaxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which\nchanges are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-\nchange taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy, Structure, and Organization\nWe currently have no products for sale. We are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, and we cannot give any\nassurances that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nTo date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our product\ncandidates. We have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful acquisition, development or\ncommercialization of the technologies we are seeking to develop. As an early stage company, we have limited experience and have not yet\ndemonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and\nrapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Our future success is substantially dependent on our ability to\nsuccessfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then commercialize such product candidates. Most of our product candidates are\ncurrently in early stage clinical trials. Our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates, which may never occur. We currently have no drug products for sale, currently generate no revenues from sales of any drug\nproducts and may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nThe successful development, and any commercialization, of our technologies and any product candidates that may occur would require us\nto successfully perform a variety of functions, including:\n● developing our technology platform;\n44\nTable of Contents\n● identifying, developing, formulating, manufacturing and, if approved, commercializing product candidates;\n● entering into successful licensing and other arrangements with product development partners;\n● participating in regulatory approval processes, including ultimately gaining approval to market a drug product, which may not\noccur;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates from our third-party manufacturers to meet clinical trial needs and, if\napproved, to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter;\n● establishing and maintaining agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially\nreasonable terms;\n● conducting sales and marketing activities including hiring, training, deploying and supporting our sales force and creating market\ndemand for our product candidates through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote our\nproduct candidates that we may establish;\n● maintaining patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and\n● raising additional required capital on acceptable terms.\nOur operations have historically been limited to organizing the Company, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology\nand identifying and obtaining preclinical data or clinical data for various product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for\nyou to assess our ability to continue to develop our technology, identify product candidates, develop and commercialize any product\ncandidates we are able to identify and enter into successful collaborative arrangements with other companies, as well as for you to assess\nthe advisability of investing in our securities. Each of these requirements will require substantial time, effort and financial resources.\nEach of our product candidates will require additional clinical development, management of clinical and manufacturing activities,\nregulatory approval in the jurisdictions in which we plan to market the product, obtaining manufacturing supply, building a commercial\norganization, and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales, which may not occur. We are not\npermitted to market or promote any of our product candidates in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction before we receive regulatory approval\nfrom the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, respectively, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our\nproduct candidates.\nOur approach to the development of our product candidates is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any\nproducts of commercial value.\nOur product candidates are emerging technologies and, consequently, it is conceivable that such technologies may ultimately fail to develop\ninto commercially viable therapies to treat human patients with cancer or other diseases. One of the reasons for the lack of commercial\nviability could be our inability to obtain regulatory approval for such technologies.\nCAR T is a new approach to cancer treatment that presents significant challenges.\nWe have concentrated much of our research and development efforts on CAR T technology, and our future success is highly dependent on\nthe successful development of T cell immunotherapies in general and our CAR T technology and product candidates in particular. Because\nCAR T is a relatively new approach to cancer immunotherapy and cancer treatment generally, developing and commercializing our product\ncandidates subjects us to a number of challenges, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that may have very limited experience with the\ncommercial development of genetically modified T cell therapies for cancer;\n45\nTable of Contents\n● developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient’s T cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered\nT cells back into the patient;\n● conditioning patients with chemotherapy in conjunction with delivering each of our products, which may increase the risk of\nadverse side effects of our product candidates;\n● educating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of each of our product candidates;\n● developing processes for the safe administration of these product candidates, including long-term follow-up for all patients who\nreceive our product candidates;\n● sourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our product candidates;\n● developing a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on\ninvestment;\n● establishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance, and obtaining\nadequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; and\n● developing therapies for types of cancers beyond those addressed by our current product candidates.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates\nor indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for\nspecific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications\nthat later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable\ncommercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and\nproduct candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately and/or effectively\nevaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product\ncandidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to\nretain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development and Commercialization\nDelays in the commencement or conduct of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our ability to pursue regulatory\napproval.\nClinical trials are expensive and can take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. We cannot guarantee that any\nclinical trials will be conducted as planned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at\nany stage and our future clinical trials may not be successful. The commencement or conduct of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety\nof reasons, including, but not necessarily limited to, delays in:\n● commencing a clinical trial, as a result of regulatory authority action;\n● identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n● reaching and preserving agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (“CROs”) and trial sites,\nthe terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary\nsignificantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n46\nTable of Contents\n● obtaining Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n● developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n● adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;\n● change in the principal investigator or other key staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;\n● identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or\n● retaining (or replacing) patients who have initiated a clinical trial but who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy,\ninsufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In\naddition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of\nregulatory approval of a product candidate.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and delay or prevent our ability to complete\ndevelopment of that product candidate or generate product revenues, if approved.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial\nplan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also\nbe delayed as a result of ambiguous or negative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in\naccordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely basis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an\nIRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing the clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site,\nor the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n● inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition\nof a clinical hold;\n● stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n● unforeseen safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n● lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these\nchanges. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may in turn impact the costs\nand timing of, and the likelihood of successfully completing, a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we must\nsuspend or terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be\ndelayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a result. In addition, many of these factors may also\nultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nProduct candidates that we advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that product\ncandidates are effective with a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before seeking regulatory approvals for their\ncommercial sale. Success in early clinical trials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, as product candidates in later-\nstage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Also, we\nmay need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not\n47\nTable of Contents\ncurrently anticipated. Companies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have\nshown promising results. As a result, product candidates that we advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nIn addition, even if our product candidates were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates or any\nfuture product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our\nproducts, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate\nwith a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate.\nThe regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings, contraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization\nof the product. Any of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more of our current or future product candidates.\nAny product candidates we advance into clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time\nconsuming, cause unanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize product candidates.\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export,\nmarketing and distribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the\nUnited States and by comparable health authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product\ncandidate until such product candidate’s BLA or NDA is approved by the FDA. The process of obtaining approval is uncertain, expensive,\noften spanning many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to\nsignificant and expensive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval for product candidates depends on\nobtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our product\ncandidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing\nprocedures or equipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has\nsubstantial discretion in the pharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate\nfor many reasons. Despite the time and expense invested in the clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never\nguaranteed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not\nlimited to:\n● the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials,\nincluding proper use of clinical trial methods and methods of data analysis;\n● an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is\nsafe and effective for an indication;\n● the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care\nis potentially different from that of the United States;\n● the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n● the FDA may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n● the FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our\nrespective collaborators currently contract for clinical supplies and plan to contract for commercial supplies do not satisfactorily\ncomply with cGMPs; or\n● the approval policies or interpretation of regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering the clinical data\ninsufficient for approval or the product characteristics or benefit-risk profile unfavorable for approval.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve\nadditional product testing, administrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological\ndevelopment during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and\nmay result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on\nsafety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in obtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in\nobtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nRegulatory approval for our product candidates by the FDA, or any similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, is limited to\nthose specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases and indications set forth in the\napproval for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA, or other similar regulatory authorities outside the United\nStates. In addition to the regulatory approval required for new drug products, new formulations or indications for an approved product also\nrequire regulatory approval. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability\nto effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those\ntested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities (“off-label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those\nindications that are specifically approved by the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Such off-label uses are\ncommon across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in certain circumstances. Regulatory\nauthorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate practice of medicine or the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory\nauthorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the promotion of off-label use. If our promotional\nactivities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement actions, including Warning\nLetters, by these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising\nmay cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall or institute fines or penalties, or could\nresult in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could\nharm our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and we or our contract manufacturer(s) fail to produce the product, or components of the\nproduct, in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug\nmanufacturers, we may face delays in the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, or be unable to meet market\ndemand, and may lose potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced\nmanufacturing techniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. We may enter into development and\nsupply agreements with contract manufacturers for the completion of pre-commercialization manufacturing development activities and, if\napproved, the manufacture of commercial supplies for one or more of our product candidates. Any termination or disruption of our\nrelationships with our contract manufacturers may materially harm our business and financial condition and frustrate any\ncommercialization efforts for each respective product candidate.\nAll of our contract manufacturers must comply with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations, including cGMP requirements\nenforced by the FDA through its establishment inspection program. We are required by law to establish adequate oversight and control over\nraw materials, components and finished products furnished by our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, but we have little\ncontrol over their compliance with these regulations. Any failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil\npenalties, suspension of production, restrictions on imports and exports, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall,\nor withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of our product and customer confidence in our product. Any\nmanufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant\n49\nTable of Contents\nconsequences, including costly recalls, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\nIf the contract manufacturers upon whom we may rely to manufacture one or more of our product candidates, and any future product\ncandidate we may in-license, fails to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis at commercially reasonable prices, we\nwould likely be unable to meet demand for our approved product and we would lose potential revenues.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of one or more of our product candidates or any\nfuture product candidate, we may need to abandon or limit the development of some of our product candidates.\nIf one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate are associated with undesirable side effects or adverse events in\nclinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow\nuses or subpopulations in which the adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more\nacceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In our industry, many compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later\nbeen found to cause serious adverse events that prevented further development of the compound. In the event that our clinical trials reveal a\nhigh or unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable\nforeign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development or deny approval of one or more of our product candidates or any\nfuture product candidate for any or all targeted indications. The FDA could also issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior\nto making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve a product candidate. The number of requests for additional data or\ninformation issued by the FDA in recent years has increased and has resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs.\nAdverse events or undesirable side effects caused by one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate could also\nresult in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our product labeling or in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities for any or all targeted indications, which would, in turn, prevent us from commercializing and generating market acceptance and\nrevenues from the sale of that product candidate. Adverse events or side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled\npatients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later\nidentify undesirable side effects caused by this product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n● regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, including specific warnings, black box\nwarnings, adverse reactions, precautions, and/or contraindications;\n● regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, and/or require it to be removed from the market;\n● we may be required to recall a product, be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical\ntrials or change the labeling of the product; or\n● our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any of our product candidates or any future\nproduct candidate or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from\ngenerating significant revenues, or any revenues, from their sale.\nEven if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, it and any other products we may market will remain\nsubject to substantial regulatory scrutiny.\nIf one or more of our product candidates that we may license or acquire is approved, the approved product candidate will be subject to\nongoing requirements and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include\n50\nTable of Contents\nlabeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information and\nreports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and\ncorresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping\nof the drug, and requirements regarding our presentations to and interactions with health care professionals.\nThe FDA, or other regulatory authorities, may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance\nto monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities closely regulates the post-approval\nmarketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of\nthe approved labeling. The FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’\ncommunications regarding off-label use and if we do not market any approved product for only their approved indications, we may be\nsubject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FDCA”) relating to the\npromotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations, civil claims, and/or criminal charges alleging violations of federal and state\nhealth care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing\nprocesses, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n● restrictions on such products, operations, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n● restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n● restrictions on product distribution or use;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n● warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, import alerts, and/or inspection observations;\n● withdrawal of the products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n● recall of products;\n● fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits;\n● suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n● suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n● refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n● product seizure; or\n● injunctions, consent decrees, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory\napproval of our product candidates, or negatively affect those products for which we may have already received regulatory approval, if any.\nIf we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able\nto maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to the various actions listed above, including losing any marketing approval that we\nmay have obtained.\n51\nTable of Contents\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may\nadversely impact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until we have completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory\nreview process, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval\nfrom the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a\nreview of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may\nalso object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our\nproposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an\nalternative brand name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to\nexpend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark\nlaws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity\nfor a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nPublic concern regarding the safety of drug products could delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval, result in the\ninclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling or require us to undertake other activities that may entail additional costs.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of the U.S. Congress, the\nGovernment Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues.\nThese events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the\nestablishment of risk management programs. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (“FDAAA”), grants significant\nexpanded authority to the FDA, much of which is aimed at improving the safety of drug products before and after approval. In particular,\nthe new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling\nto reflect new safety information and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently\napproved drugs. It also significantly expands the federal government’s clinical trial registry and results databank, which we expect will\nresult in significantly increased government oversight of clinical trials. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other\nprovisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties, among other regulatory, civil and criminal penalties. The\nincreased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials.\nData from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny, particularly with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities more likely to require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA requires us to conduct additional preclinical\nstudies or clinical trials prior to approving any of our product candidates, our ability to obtain approval of this product candidate will be\ndelayed. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical data following the approval of any of our product candidates,\nthe indications for which this product candidate is approved may be limited or there may be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and\nour efforts to commercialize our product candidates may be otherwise adversely impacted.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could\nbe delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a\nsufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United\nStates. Some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications that we are targeting for\nour product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our\ncompetitors’ product candidates. Available therapies for the indications we are pursuing can also affect enrollment in our clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is affected by other factors including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the severity of the disease under investigation;\n● the eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n52\nTable of Contents\n● the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n● the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n● the patient referral practices of physicians;\n● the number of clinical trials sponsored by other companies for the same patient population;\n● the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n● the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to\nabandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our\nproduct candidates or future product candidates, which would cause the value of our Company to decline and limit our ability to obtain\nadditional financing.\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved\nmore quickly, marketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidate\nwill be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face,\ncompetition in the development and, if approved, marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies,\nresearch institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not\nrender one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of\nother drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease, occur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. These\ndevelopments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial\nopportunity for one or more of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative\nformulations outside the scope of our in-licensed patents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n● capital resources;\n● development resources, including personnel and technology;\n● clinical trial experience;\n● regulatory experience;\n● expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and\n● manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing experience.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may\nobtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product\ncandidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, safe, useful and less costly than ours and may be more\nsuccessful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant\ncompetitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We will also face competition from\nthese third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-licensing new product\ncandidates.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFurther, generic therapies are typically sold at lower prices than branded therapies and are generally preferred by hospital formularies and\nmanaged care providers of health services. We anticipate that, if approved, our product candidates will face increasing competition in the\nform of generic versions of branded products of competitors, including those that have lost or will lose their patent exclusivity. In the\nfuture, we may face additional competition from a generic form of our own candidates when the patents covering them begin to expire, or\nearlier if the patents are successfully challenged. If we are unable to demonstrate to physicians and payers that the key differentiating\nfeatures of our product candidates translate to overall clinical benefit or lower cost of care, we may not be able to compete with generic\nalternatives.\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed but, if approved, do not achieve broad market acceptance among\nphysicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates generate from sales\nwill be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare\npayors and the medical community. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government\npayors, generally would also be necessary for commercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would\ndepend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n● the timing of market introduction of such approved product as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n● the safety of such product candidates seen in a broader patient group, (i.e., based on actual use);\n● the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;\n● the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n● changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for our product candidates;\n● the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product candidate for clinical practices;\n● the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions,\nwarnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;\n● changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could\nreduce the marketing impact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n● the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for a companion diagnostic, if any;\n● the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n● the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is not perceived as being as\nbeneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial\nsale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any\napproved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and\nour ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or\n54\nTable of Contents\nreimbursement. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-\nparty payors, our ability to generate revenues from that product would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the\nmedical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained\nby FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for\nus to sell our products profitably.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Such third-party payors\ninclude government health programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We intend\nto seek approval to market our product candidates in the U.S., the European Union (“EU”) and other selected foreign jurisdictions. Market\nacceptance and sales of our product candidates in both domestic and international markets will depend significantly on the availability of\nadequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and may be affected by existing and future\nhealth care reform measures. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting\nboth coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our\nproduct candidates, if approved. These payors may conclude that our product candidates are less safe, less effective or less cost-effective\nthan existing or future introduced products, and third-party payors may not approve our product candidates, if approved, for coverage and\nreimbursement or may cease providing coverage and reimbursement for these product candidates.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly\nprocess that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products.\nWe may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our\nfuture products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or\nsustain profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these\ncountries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a\nproduct candidate. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials\nthat compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates, if\napproved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable\nto achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such a country.\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and\nsell our product candidates, we may be unsuccessful in commercializing our product candidates, if they are approved.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to\ncommercialize any approved product candidate, we would need to build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical\ncapabilities or arrange for third parties to perform these services, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so. In the event of successful\ndevelopment and regulatory approval of any of our current or future product candidates, we expect to build a targeted specialist sales force\nto market or co-promote the product. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For\nexample, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial\nlaunch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any\nreason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment\nwould be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\n55\nTable of Contents\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, on our own include, but are not necessarily\nlimited to:\n● our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n● the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future\nproducts;\n● the lack of complementary or other products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage\nfrom the perspective of sales efficiency relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n● unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating our own sales and marketing organization.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one\nor more of our product candidates or a future product candidate, if approved, we may license or acquire and may have to limit their\ncommercialization.\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale\nof any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if\nany product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, and,\nif approved, during marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in\ndesign, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims\nmight be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot\nsuccessfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability\nclaims may result in:\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● impairment of our business reputation;\n● costs of related litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n● loss of revenues;\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n● the inability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates, if approved.\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for any and all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage\nmay not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is\nbecoming increasingly expensive, and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient\namounts to protect us against losses due to liability. When needed we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of\ncommercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates in development, but we may be unable to\nobtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On occasion, large judgments have\nbeen\n56\nTable of Contents\nawarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims\nbrought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and\nadversely affect our business.\nProduct candidates, even if successfully developed and commercialized, may be effective only in combating certain specific types of\ncancer, and the market for drugs designed to combat such cancer type(s) may be small and unprofitable.\nThere are many different types of cancer, and a treatment that is effective against one type of cancer may not be effective against another.\nCAR T or other technologies we pursue may only be effective in combating specific types of cancer but not others. Even if one or more of\nour product candidates, if approved, proves to be an effective treatment against a given type of cancer, the number of patients suffering\nfrom such cancer may be small, in which case potential sales from a therapy designed to combat such cancer would be limited.\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage\npublic perception of our product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for\nour product candidates.\nPublic perception may be influenced by claims that one or more of the therapies underpinning our product candidates is unsafe, and such\ntherapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. More restrictive government regulations or negative public\nopinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair the development and\ncommercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not\nultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable\npublic perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements\nfor those product candidates that do obtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Concern about\nenvironmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated, may also hinder the commercialization of our products.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may\nnot perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or complying with applicable regulatory\nrequirements.\nWe rely on our licensors to conduct some of our preclinical studies and some of our clinical trials for our product candidates and for future\nproduct candidates, and we rely on third-party CROs and site management organizations to conduct most of the remainder of our\npreclinical studies and all the rest of our clinical trials. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as our licensors, CROs, site\nmanagement organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our\npreclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. The agreements with these third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a\nfailure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that could delay our product development\nactivities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us\nof our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted\nin accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in\naccordance with good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) as appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly\nreferred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and\nreported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory\nauthorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our\nCROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications.\nWe cannot assure you that upon inspection by a regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials\ncomplies with GCP regulations. In addition, our\n57\nTable of Contents\nclinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require\nus to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and\npost the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to\ndo so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nThe third parties with whom we have contracted to help perform our preclinical studies and/or clinical trials may also have relationships\nwith other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet\nexpected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols,\nwe will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or\nmay be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter into\narrangements with alternative CROs or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding\nadditional CROs or site management organizations involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a\nnatural transition period when a new CRO or site management organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could\ncompromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines.\nWe are currently reliant on COH, Fred Hutch, and UAB for a substantial portion of our research and development efforts and the early\nclinical testing of our product candidates.\nA substantial portion of our research and development has been and will continue to be conducted by COH, Fred Hutch, and UAB,\npursuant to a sponsored research agreement and/or clinical trial agreements with each of those parties. As a result, our future success is\nheavily dependent on the results of research and development efforts of Dr. Stephen Forman and his team at COH, of Drs. Brian Till and\nMazyar Shadman and their team at Fred Hutch, and of Dr. James M. Markert and his team at UAB. We have limited control over the nature\nor timing of their research and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities, and as a result can provide little assurance that their efforts\nwill be successful.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and may also do so for\ncommercialization, if and when our product candidates are approved. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not\nhave sufficient quantities of our product candidates or any future product candidate or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which\ncould delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nDue to limited resources, and in light of our reduction in work force in April 2024, we may increase our reliance on third-party\nmanufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of one or more product candidates for which our\ncollaborators or we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on\nacceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails\nadditional risks, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n· reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, while still being required by law to establish\nadequate oversight and control over products furnished by that third party;\n· the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n· manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials due to supply chain disruptions, give\ngreater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according\nto the terms of the agreement between us;\n· the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n58\nTable of Contents\n· the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nWe rely on our third-party manufacturers to produce or purchase from third-party suppliers the materials and equipment necessary to\nproduce our product candidates for our preclinical and clinical trials. Forces beyond our control could disrupt the global supply chain and\nimpact our or our third-party manufacturers’ ability to obtain raw materials or other products necessary to manufacture our product\ncandidates. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials and equipment that we use (or that are used on our behalf) to\nmanufacture our product candidates, and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the\nmanufacture of the materials and equipment necessary to produce our product candidates for our preclinical and clinical trials, and if\napproved, ultimately for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials or\nequipment by our third-party manufacturers. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components\nthereof, for an ongoing preclinical or clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay\ncompletion of our preclinical or clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our\nmanufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials or equipment after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product\ncandidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair\nour ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nThe facilities used by contract manufacturers to potentially manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to\ninspections that will be conducted after we submit an New Drug Application (NDA) or BLA to the FDA. We are required by law to\nestablish adequate oversight and control over raw materials, components and finished products furnished by our contract manufacturers,\nbut we do not control the day-to-day manufacturing operations of, and are dependent on, the contract manufacturers for compliance with\ncurrent Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations for manufacture of our product candidates. Third-party manufacturers may\nnot be able to comply with the cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of\nour third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical\nholds, fines, injunctions, restrictions on imports and exports, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license\nrevocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could\nsignificantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nOne or more of the product candidates that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to\nmanufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of\nmanufacturing for us. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or\nmarketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. If our current contract manufacturers cannot\nperform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying\nany replacement manufacturers.\nFuture dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins\nand our ability to commercialize any products that may receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. We also expect to\nrely on third parties to distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay\nclinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing\nadditional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct all aspects of our LV vector production and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not independently conduct our LV vector production and we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties with\nrespect to the manufacture of these items.\nOur reliance on these third parties for manufacturing LV vector reduces our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our\nresponsibility to ensure compliance with all required regulations and study protocols. For products that we develop and, if approved,\ncommercialize, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our IND-enabling studies and clinical studies is conducted in\naccordance with the study plan and protocols, and that our LV vectors are manufactured in accordance with GMP as applied in the relevant\njurisdictions.\n59\nTable of Contents\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, conduct our studies in accordance with\nregulatory requirements or our stated study plans and protocols, or manufacture our LV vectors in accordance with GMP, we will not be\nable to complete, or may be delayed in completing, the preclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing process validation activities\nrequired to support future IND, market authorization application and BLA submissions and approval of our product candidates, or to\nsupport commercialization of our products, if approved. Many of our agreements with these third parties contain termination provisions\nthat allow these third parties to terminate their relationships with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our\nproduct development and commercialization activities could be delayed.\nWe may be forced to enter into an agreement with a different manufacturer, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all.\nIn some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture LV vector for our drug product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the\noriginal manufacturer, and we may have difficulty or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a\nback-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. Any of these events could lead to clinical study delays or\nfailure to obtain marketing approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates or any future product\ncandidates, if approved. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial\nsuspension of production.\nWe rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we seek to develop product candidates with well-studied mechanisms of action, and\nwe utilize biomarkers to assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical\ndata and other results obtained by third parties that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. Further, such clinical data and\nresults may be based on products or product candidates that are significantly different from our product candidates or any future product\ncandidate. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate, unreliable or not applicable to our product candidates or\nfuture product candidate, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our product candidates and our research and\ndevelopment efforts could be compromised.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available\non commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development and\ncommercialization of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties, who may or\nmay not be interested in granting such a license, to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license\nfrom these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no\nassurance of financial return.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the\nestablishment of collaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment\nof our financial, regulatory or intellectual property position. In addition, there has been a significant number of recent business\ncombinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we\nsuccessfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of\nproduct candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative arrangements, the related product\nrevenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products. Such collaborators may also consider alternative product\ncandidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more\nattractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\n60\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\nWe are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and managed care initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and\nadversely affect our ability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital.\nIn the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and\nregulatory changes to the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidate, restrict or regulate\npost-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. The Patient\nProtection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA” or\ncollectively, the “ACA”), substantially regulates the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United\nStates. Among other things, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs\nfrom 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible\nannual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government\nprograms; implemented a new methodology under which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are\ncalculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\ncreated a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical\neffectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) at\nthe CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including\nprescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there\nwill be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Drug pricing continues to be a subject of debate at the executive\nand legislative levels of U.S. government. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 signed into law by President Biden on March 14, 2021,\nincludes a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. With the\nelimination of the rebate cap, manufacturers may be required to compensate states in an amount greater than what the state Medicaid\nprograms pay for the drug. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains substantial drug pricing reforms, including the\nestablishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that would require\nmanufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the\nestablishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price\nincreases that outpace inflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for\nnoncompliance with the drug pricing provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the\neffect of reducing the prices we can charge and reimbursement we receive for our product candidates, if approved, thereby reducing our\nprofitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. The effect of\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general is not yet known.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product\npricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure\nand transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe expect that additional federal, state, and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the\namounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and\nreimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.\nThese and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in\nadditional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any current or future product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement\nfrom Medicare or other government healthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The\nimplementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain\nprofitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-\napproval requirements and restrict sales and\n61\nTable of Contents\npromotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations,\nguidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of any current or future\nproduct candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased Congressional scrutiny of the FDA’s approval process may significantly delay or\nprevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other\npersonnel, or otherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could\nnegatively impact our business or the business of our partners.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and\nfunding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy\nchanges. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other\ngovernment agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and\nunpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary\ngovernment agencies, which would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. The U.S. government has shut down\nseveral times in the past, and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop\nroutine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and\nprocess our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the timing of FDA’s review and approval\nof new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be delayed, which could result in delayed milestone\nrevenues and materially harm our operations or business.\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly\nor indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and\nother healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational\nharm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and\nprescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and\ncustomers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the\nfederal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and\nrelationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we\nmay be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state governments and by governments in foreign\njurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our\nability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting,\nreceiving offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either (1)\nthe referral of an individual to a person for, furnishing any item or service for which payment is available under a federal health\ncare program, or (2) the purchase, lease, order or recommendation thereof of any good, facility, service or item for which payment\nis available under a federal healthcare program;\n● The False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly\npresenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government or making or using, or\ncausing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n· The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which created new federal criminal statutes\nthat prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, obtaining money or\n62\nTable of Contents\nproperty of the health care benefit program through false representations or knowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or\ncovering up a material fact, making false statements or using or making any false or fraudulent document in connection with the\ndelivery of, or payment for, health care benefits or services;\n· HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its\nimplementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually\nidentifiable health information;\n· The provision under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires applicable\nmanufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to track and annually report to CMS payments and other\ntransfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians\nor their immediate family members in applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations; applicable manufacturers are\nalso required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided, as well as ownership and investment\ninterests held, to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-\nmidwives;\n· The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give\nanything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise\nobtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\nAdditionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government,\nand the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are\nsubject to regulation under the FCPA; and\n· State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and state laws\nconcerning security and privacy of health care information, which may differ in substance and application from state-to-state\nthereby complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve\nsubstantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or\nfuture statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are\nfound to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant\ncivil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in\ngovernment healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do\nbusiness, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or\nadministrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect\nour business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur\ncosts that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the\nhandling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and\nflammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally\ncontract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these\nmaterials. Although we believe that the safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards\nprescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the\nevent of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages,\n63\nTable of Contents\nand any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for\nfailure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees\nresulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not\nmaintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal\nof biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nThese current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these\nlaws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes Thereof\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and\ncommercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and\nproducts may be impaired.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for product candidates and their formulations and uses. The\npatent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be\nsuccessful in obtaining patents or what the scope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not\nnecessarily limited to, the following:\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive\nproduct candidates and their formulations and uses developed or produced by others;\n● our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us or our partners, and many of which have made\nsignificant investments in competing technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere\nwith our abilities to make, use, and sell potential product candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent\napplications that we may have;\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent\nprotection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy\nregarding worldwide health concerns; and\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing\nforeign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be\nunenforceable, or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance\nsubmission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review\nor interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial,\nand it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S.\npatent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of,\nrender unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete\ndirectly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party\npatent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could\ndissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are\noften responsible for maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately\nprosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to develop and commercialize products may be adversely\naffected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. Such a failure to properly\nprotect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our\n64\nTable of Contents\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent\napplications or patent claims to protect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as\nwell as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of issued patents.\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to\nprotect our and their trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third\nparties, and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still\ncome upon this same or similar information independently. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and\nmay unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’ proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able\nto identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is\ndifficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States\nare less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or\nindependently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate\nit, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or\nindependently developed by a competitor, our competitive positions would be harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable\npatent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our\nresearch and development output and methodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given\nthe uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent applications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or\nprocess(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or been modified, leaving our product(s) or\nprocess(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for one or\nmore product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary\ninformation and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our\nability to generate revenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult\nwith or cede control to collaborators regarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents\nand applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual\nquestions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims\nallowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. The patent situation outside the U.S. is even more\nuncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may fail to seek or\nobtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the\nhuman body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and\npatent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at\nall. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or\npending patent applications that we own or licensed, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such\ninventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention,\ndepending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the\nUSPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. We might also become involved in derivation proceedings in an event that a third\nparty misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or more inventions. The\ncosts of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party\nderived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the\nissuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent\napplications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively\nprevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the\npatent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example,\nthe federal courts of the U.S. have taken an increasingly dim view of the\n65\nTable of Contents\npatent eligibility of certain subject matter, such as naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of\nutilizing the same, which include their detection in a biological sample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection. Such\nsubject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry to protect their discoveries, is now\nconsidered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the U.S. Accordingly, we cannot\npredict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent\ncompetitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent\nour owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed\nand approved for commercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval\n(depending on the nature of the specific product), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this\nexclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity expires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the\nproduct, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which\nwould materially adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our licensors to maintain and enforce the intellectual property covering certain of our product candidates. We have\nlimited, if any, control over the resources that our licensors can or will devote to securing, maintaining, and enforcing patents\nprotecting our product candidates.\nWe depend on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our product candidates and we have limited, if any, control over the\namount or timing of resources that they devote on our behalf, or the priority they place on, maintaining patent rights and prosecuting patent\napplications to our advantage. Moreover, we have limited, if any, control over the strategies and arguments employed in the maintenance of\npatent rights and the prosecution of patent applications to our advantage. Our licensors might become involved in disputes with one of their\nother licensees, and we or a portion of our licensed patent rights might become embroiled in such disputes.\nOur licensors, depending on the patent or application, are responsible for maintaining issued patents and prosecuting patent applications.\nWe cannot be sure that they will perform as required. Should they decide they no longer want to maintain any of the patents licensed to us,\nthey are required to afford us the opportunity to do so at our expense. If our licensors do not perform, and if we do not assume the\nmaintenance of the licensed patents in sufficient time to make required payments or filings with the appropriate governmental agencies, we\nrisk losing the benefit of all or some of those patent rights. Moreover, and possibly unbeknownst to us, our licensors may experience\nserious difficulties related to their overall business or financial stability, and they may be unwilling or unable to continue to expend the\nfinancial resources required to maintain and prosecute these patents and patent applications. While we intend to take actions reasonably\nnecessary to enforce our patent rights, we depend, in part, on our licensors to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights and to\ninform us of the status of those protections and efforts thereto.\nOur licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights.\nWe may have limited, if any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and\ntemporary or permanent exclusionary orders in the U.S. or other countries. Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense\nagainst third-party claims of infringement. We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors\ndevote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-party claims of infringement.\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we or our licensors may not be successful\nin defending claims of intellectual property infringement alleged by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations. Regardless of the outcome of any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to\nmanagement.\n66\nTable of Contents\nProtecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly, and we may be unable to ensure their protection.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not\nadequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, in addition to being costly and time consuming to\nundertake. For example:\n● our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued\npatents;\n● our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n● others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our product candidates or any future product\ncandidate technologies;\n● it is possible that none of the pending patent applications licensed to us will result in issued patents;\n● the scope of our issued patents may not extend to competitive products developed or produced by others;\n● the issued patents covering our product candidates or any future product candidate may not provide a basis for market exclusivity\nfor active products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties;\n● we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n● intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time\nconsuming and unsuccessful, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be\nrequired to file one or more actions for patent infringement, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against\naccused infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents; or provoke those\nparties to petition the USPTO to institute inter partes review against the asserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of\nthe claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or\nunenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue\non the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question or as a matter of public policy. An adverse result in any litigation\nproceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, rendered unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore,\nadverse results on U.S. patents may affect related patents in our global portfolio.\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an\nunfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture,\nmarket and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and\npending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may\nbe directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter of our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take\nmany years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our product\ncandidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our product candidates of which we\nor our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent\napplications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all.\nTherefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending\npatent applications that we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the\nevent that a third party has also filed a U.S. patent application\n67\nTable of Contents\nrelating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may have\nto participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these\nproceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a\nmaterial adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or\nany of our licensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and\nbiopharmaceutical industries generally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third\nparty’s intellectual property rights, we may have to, among other things:\n● obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n● abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial\nfunds, time and resources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;\n● pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or\nproprietary technology at issue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;\n● pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or\n● defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial\ndiversion of financial and management resources.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal\nresponsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant\nexpenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public\nannouncements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors\nperceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or\nproceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future\nsales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings\nadequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because\nof their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings\ncould compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses and third party funding arrangements, we could lose\nrights that are important to our business.\nWe are currently a party to license agreements with COH, Fred Hutch, Nationwide and Mayo Clinic. In the future, we may become party to\nlicenses that are important for product development and commercialization. If we fail to comply with our obligations under current or\nfuture license and funding agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not\nbe able to develop, manufacture or market any product or utilize any technology that is covered by these agreements or may face other\npenalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially and adversely affect the value of a product candidate being developed\nunder any such agreement or could restrict our drug discovery activities. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our\nrights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to\nlose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\n68\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their\nformer employers or other clients.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates,\nmany of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other\nbiopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether\nthese individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or misappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their\nformer employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in\ndefending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or the employees or consultants\nthat are implicated.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for our product candidates or any future product candidate, we also rely on trade secrets, including\nunpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position, particularly where we do not\nbelieve patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We limit disclosure of such trade\nsecrets where possible but we also seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements\nwith parties who do have access to them, such as our employees, our licensors, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators,\ncontract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment\nagreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and may\nunintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate\nremedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and\ntime-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or\nunwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a\ncompetitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to\ncompete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position\nwould be harmed.\nWe in-license intellectual property pertaining to certain product candidates from third parties. As such, any dispute with the licensors or\nthe non-performance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product\ncandidates.\nThe types of disputes which may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not\nlimited to:\n● the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n● the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license\nagreements;\n● the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the\nlicensors’ right title and interest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such\nagreements;\n● the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the\nrights and obligations associated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense\nunder such license agreement;\n● the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what\nactivities or achievements satisfy those diligence obligations;\n69\nTable of Contents\n● whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;\n● the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;\n● the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual\nproperty that is the subject of such license agreements;\n● the calculation of royalty, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;\n● the extent to which license rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;\n● whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to\nhave occurred, is or can be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;\n● disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent\nexpenses;\n● intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to\nlicensed intellectual property) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and\n● the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain\nprovisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or\nmore agreements, which would make us susceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing\npartners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our\nrights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the\nrelevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current\nlicensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected\nproduct candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Control by Fortress\nFortress controls a voting majority of our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Class A Preferred Stock held by Fortress, Fortress is entitled to cast, for each share of Class A Preferred held by\nFortress, the number of votes that is equal to one and one-tenth (1.1) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the shares\nof outstanding common stock and (B) the whole shares of common stock into which the shares of outstanding Class A common shares and\nthe Class A Preferred Stock are convertible and the denominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock.\nAccordingly, Fortress is able to control or significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election\nof directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of Fortress may not always coincide with\nthe interests of other stockholders, and Fortress may take actions that advance its own interests and are contrary to the desires of our other\nstockholders. Moreover, this concentration of voting power may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of us even when such a change\nmay be in the best interests of all stockholders, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common\nstock as part of a sale of our Company or our assets, and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\n70\nTable of Contents\nFortress has the right to receive a significant grant of shares of our common stock annually which will result in the dilution of your\nholdings of common stock upon each grant, which could reduce their value.\nUnder the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Founders Agreement (the “Founders Agreement”), which became effective July 22,\n2016, Fortress will receive a grant of shares of our common stock equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the gross amount of any\nequity or debt financing. Additionally, the Class A Preferred Stock, as a class, will receive an annual dividend on January 1st, payable in\nshares of common stock in an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of our fully-diluted outstanding capital stock as of the\nbusiness day immediately prior to January 1st of such year. Fortress currently owns all outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock.\nThese share issuances to Fortress and any other holder of Class A Preferred Stock will dilute your holdings in our common stock and, if the\nvalue of our Company has not grown proportionately over the prior year, would result in a reduction in the value of your shares. The\nFounders Agreement has a term of 15 years and renews automatically for subsequent one-year periods unless terminated by Fortress or\nupon a Change in Control (as defined in the Founders Agreement).\nWe might have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Fortress.\nThe agreements we have entered into with Fortress include a Management Services Agreement and the Founders Agreement. While we\nbelieve the terms of these agreements are reasonable, they might not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations\nbetween unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements relate to, among other things, payment of a royalty on product sales and the\nprovision of employment and transition services. We might have received better terms from third parties because, among other things, third\nparties might have competed with each other to win our business.\nThe dual roles of our directors who also serve in similar roles with Fortress could create a conflict of interest and will require careful\nmonitoring by our independent directors.\nWe share some directors with Fortress which could create conflicts of interest between the two companies in the future. While we believe\nthat the Founders Agreement and the Management Services Agreement were negotiated by independent parties on both sides on arm’s\nlength terms, and the fiduciary duties of both parties were thereby satisfied, in the future situations may arise under the operation of both\nagreements that may create a conflict of interest. We will have to be diligent to ensure that any such situation is resolved by independent\nparties. In particular, under the Management Services Agreement, Fortress and its affiliates are free to pursue opportunities which could\npotentially be of interest to us, and they are not required to notify us prior to pursuing such opportunities. Any conflict of interest or pursuit\nby Fortress of such a corporate opportunity could expose us to claims by our investors and/or creditors and could harm our results of\noperations.\nGeneral Risks and Risks Associated with Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’\ncybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary\ncourse of business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our\nintellectual property and proprietary business information, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we\nmaintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced\nelements of our operations to third party vendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure\nrisk.\nDespite the implementation of our internal security and business continuity measures and our information technology infrastructure, our\ninternal computer systems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from\ncomputer viruses and unauthorized access. Our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate\nfirewalls, servers, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection to the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or\ninterruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical\nfailures, as well as security breaches from\n71\nTable of Contents\ninadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-\nattacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering\nand other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), each of which could\ncompromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized\naccess to, our data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development\nprograms and our business operations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in\nour regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for\nthe manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their\nsystems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a\nsecurity breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments,\nand cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the\nworld have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial espionage) are skilled at adapting\nto existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which could result\nin the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not\nbe able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change\nfrequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as\nexternal service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of,\npersonal information, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual\nproperty, proprietary business information, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable\ncompetitors to compete with us more effectively, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law\nequivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the\nprivacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational\ndamage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our\nreputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in\nconnection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security\nincidents and otherwise implement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may\ncause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage\nthird-party experts and consultants.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to\ncompensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party\nsystems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such\ninsurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all\nclaims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and\ndivert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and other contractors and\nconsultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may\nhave to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future\nevents of this nature from occurring.\n72\nTable of Contents\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, which could cause significant disruptions in\nour operations.\nHealth pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past and could again in the future result in quarantines, stay-\nat-home orders, remote work policies or other similar events that may disrupt businesses, delay our research and development programs\nand timelines, negatively impact productivity and increase risks associated with cybersecurity, the future magnitude of which will depend,\nin part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations. More specifically, these types of events may negatively impact\npersonnel at third-party manufacturing facilities or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our supply chain. In addition,\nimpact on the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities could negatively affect our planned approval processes. Finally,\neconomic conditions and business activity may be negatively impacted and may not recover as quickly as anticipated. The effects of\nepidemics and pandemic are highly uncertain and subject to change. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events\neffectively, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur growth is subject to economic and geopolitical conditions.\nOur business is affected by global and local economic and geopolitical conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, inflation,\nrecession, financial liquidity, currency volatility, growth, and policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions\nand financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash\nflows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged\nshutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Geopolitical changes, including war or other conflicts\n(including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas), some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our\nsupply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the\nintense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and\nretain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the\nachievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not\nnecessarily limited to noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to\nwhich such employees, consultants and partners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could\ninclude intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with\nfederal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal\nprocedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In\nparticular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to\nprevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of\npricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements.\nEmployee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials,\nwhich could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take\nto detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any\nsuch actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a\nsignificant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal\nsanctions.\n73\nTable of Contents\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition\ntarget companies, all pursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we\nhave in place with each of our employees and consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or\nconsultants may nonetheless disclose such information through negligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could\nsubject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes, analyses and memoranda that we have generated based on\nsuch information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of such materials by our\nemployees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made to our competitors.\nWe rely on information technology, and any internet or internal computer system failures, inadequacies, interruptions or compromises\nof our systems or the security of confidential information could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nAlthough a significant portion of our business is conducted using traditional methods of contact and communications such as face-to-face\nmeetings, our business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including\ninternet-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. We could experience system failures\nand degradations in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent an extended and/or material system failure if any of the\nfollowing or similar events occurs:\n● human error;\n● subsystem, component, or software failure;\n● a power or telecommunications failure;\n● hacker attacks, cyber-attacks, software viruses, security breaches, unauthorized access or intentional acts of vandalism; or\n● terrorist acts or war.\nIf any of the foregoing events were to occur, our business operations could be disrupted in ways that would require the incurrence of\nsubstantial expenditures to remedy. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result\nin a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed clinical trials for one\nor more of our product conducts could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or\nreproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data and applications,\nor inappropriate/unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information (including trade secrets), we could incur liability and\nour business and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits, or we could lose key data which could\ncause us to curtail or cease operations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health\nepidemics and pandemics, floods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability\nto operate our businesses could be seriously impaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be\nadequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase\nadditional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any significant losses that are not recoverable under\nour insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects. Any of the aforementioned circumstances,\nincluding without limitation the resurgence of COVID-19 virus, may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to provide\nservices in-person and/or in a timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and\ntrigger effectiveness of “force majeure” clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we\nare obligated to achieve developmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over\n74\nTable of Contents\nthe applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the enforceability of developmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in\nlight of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common\nstock or cause it to continue to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share\nprice or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include, among other things:\n· the commencement, enrollment, or results of our current and future preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the results of trials of our\ncompetitors or those of other companies in our market sector;\n· regulatory approval of our product candidates, or limitations to specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes\nor delays in the regulatory review process;\n· manufacturing, supply or distribution delays or shortages;\n· our ability to identify and successfully acquire or in-license new product candidates on acceptable terms;\n· FDA, state or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications any of our product candidates;\n· legislative or regulatory changes;\n· judicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n· changes in government programs;\n· announcements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our\ncompetitors;\n· market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n· fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n· changes in accounting principles;\n· litigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or similar product candidates;\n· sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; and\n· our ability to obtain additional financing to advance our development operations;\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating\nperformance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In addition, in the\npast, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action\nlitigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a\ndiversion of our management’s attention and resources.\n75\nTable of Contents\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the\ncommon stock of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock\nto decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of\nits securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant\nstock price volatility in recent years. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and\ndiverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and standards of Nasdaq, our common\nstock may be delisted from Nasdaq.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MBIO.” The Nasdaq Capital Market requires that listed\ncompanies satisfy continued listing standards to maintain their listing. On March 13, 2024, we received a deficiency letter (the “Letter”)\nfrom the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with the minimum\nstockholders’ equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Nasdaq Listing\nRule 5550(b)(1) requires companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 (the\n“Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, reported\nstockholders’ equity of $123,000. The Letter further noted that as of its date, we did not have a market value of listed securities of $35\nmillion, or net income from continued operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the last three most\nrecently completed fiscal years, the alternative quantitative standards for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nThe Letter had no immediate effect on our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to our compliance with the other\ncontinued listing requirements. In accordance with Nasdaq rules, we were provided 45 calendar days, or until April 29, 2024, to submit a\nplan to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”). We submitted our Compliance Plan on April 29, 2024, and the Staff granted our\nrequest for an extension of 180 calendar days through September 9, 2024, to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement.\nOn May 16, 2024, we received a notice (the “Second Letter”) from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that the bid price of our common stock\nhad closed below $1.00 per share for 31 consecutive business days and, as a result, we were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2), which sets forth the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Second Letter\nfrom Nasdaq had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we\nwere afforded a 180-calendar day grace period, or until November 12, 2024, to regain compliance with the bid price requirement.\nCompliance can be achieved by evidencing a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days\n(but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the 180-calendar day grace period.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the bid price requirement by November 12, 2024, we may be eligible for an additional 180-calendar\nday compliance period so long as we satisfy the criteria for initial listing on Nasdaq and the continued listing requirement for market value\nof publicly held shares and we provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period\nby effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. In the event we are not eligible for the second grace period, Nasdaq staff will provide written\nnotice that our common stock is subject to delisting; however, we may request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”),\nwhich request, if timely made, would stay any further suspension or delisting action by the Staff pending the conclusion of the hearing\nprocess and expiration of any extension that may be granted by the Panel. Although we intend to take all reasonable measures available to\nregain compliance under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we\nwould be successful in our efforts to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf we are delisted from Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that our common stock will be eligible for trading on another stock exchange or\nquotation on an over-the-counter market. If we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our\ncommon stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for stockholders to sell\n76\nTable of Contents\ntheir shares. Additionally, if we are delisted from Nasdaq, but obtain a substitute listing or quotation service for our common stock, it will\nlikely be on a market with less liquidity and our common stock may therefore experience potentially more price volatility than it has\nhistorically experienced on Nasdaq. Stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock on any such substitute market in the\nquantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our\ncommon stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the value and liquidity of our common stock would likely be adversely affected. A delisting of our\ncommon stock from Nasdaq could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of\nconfidence by investors, employees and/or business partners.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nPursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), we issued 353,086\nshares of our common stock to Fortress as the Annual Stock Dividend (as such term is defined in the Certificate of Incorporation),\nrepresenting 2.5% of our fully-diluted outstanding equity on January 2, 2024.\nThe issuance of the above securities was deemed to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of\nthe Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering.\nOn June 19, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “June 2024 SPA”) with an institutional accredited investor, for a\nprivate placement offering of warrants to purchase 6,130,000 shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the June 2024 SPA, we agreed to\nissue and sell the warrants at an offering price of $0.41 per warrant to purchase one share of our Common Stock. The warrants have an\nexercise price of $0.41 per share (subject to adjustment as set forth in the warrants), were exercisable beginning on the date on which\nstockholder approval was received, which was obtained on June 27, 2024, and will expire five (5) years from the date on which the\nwarrants become exercisable. The warrants contain standard anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price including for share splits, share\ndividend, rights offerings and pro rata distributions. This private placement closed on June 21, 2024, concurrently with an offering to the\nsame institutional accredited investor that was registered under the Securities Act. The gross proceeds to us from the private placement,\nbefore deducting placement agent fees and other estimated offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $2.5 million. H.C.\nWainwright & Co., LLC (“Wainwright”) acted as the exclusive placement agent in connection with the private placement under an\nengagement, between us and Wainwright. Pursuant to the Engagement Letter, Wainwright was paid a cash fee equal to 7.0% of the gross\nproceeds received by us in the Offerings, a management fee equal to 1.0% of the gross proceeds of the Offering, $25,000 for non-\naccountable expenses, $50,000 for fees and expenses of legal counsel and other out-of-pocket expenses, and a clearing fee of $15,950. In\naddition, under the terms of the Engagement Letter, we issued to Wainwright (or its designees) warrants to purchase up to 367,800 shares of\nour Common Stock (the “PA Warrants”). The PA Warrants have substantially the same terms as the Warrants, except that the PA Warrants\nwill expire five (5) years from the commencement of the sales of the Offerings and have an exercise price of $0.5125 per share (subject to\ncustomary adjustment as set forth in the PA Warrants). The June 2024 Warrants were offered and sold in reliance on the exemption from\nregistration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The investor also represented that it qualified as an “accredited investor”\nwithin the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4.

The words “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,”\n“could,” “design,” “due,” “estimate,” “expect,” “goal,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “plan,” “positioned,” “potential,” “predict,” “seek,” “should,” “target,”\n“will,” “would” and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the results\nanticipated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, those discussed under the caption “Risk Factors,” set\nforth in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about our:\n● expectations for increases or decreases in expenses;\n● expectations for the clinical and pre-clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our pharmaceutical product\ncandidates or any other products we may acquire or in-license;\n● use of clinical research centers and other contractors;\n● expectations for incurring capital expenditures to expand our research and development and manufacturing capabilities;\n● expectations for generating revenue or becoming profitable on a sustained basis;\n● expectations or ability to enter into marketing and other partnership agreements;\n● expectations or ability to enter into product acquisition and in-licensing transactions;\n● expectations or ability to build our own commercial infrastructure to manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, if approved;\n● expectations for the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by doctors, patients or payors;\n● ability to compete against other companies and research institutions;\n● ability to secure adequate protection for our intellectual property;\n● ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n● ability to obtain reimbursement for our products, if approved;\n● estimates of the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents and investments to finance our operating requirements, including expectations\nregarding the value and liquidity of our investments;\n● stock price and the volatility of the equity markets;\n● expected losses; and\n● expectations for future capital requirements.\nWe have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about future events and financial\ntrends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, and financial needs. In light of the significant uncertainties in\nthese forward-looking statements, you should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Except as required by law, we assume\nno responsibility for updating any forward-looking statements.\nWe qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. The risks described below are a summary of the principal\nrisks associated with an investment in us and are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, the risk factors described in Part I,\nItem 1A of this Form 10-K, and the other reports and documents that we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nRisks Related to our Finances and Capital Requirements\n● We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\n● There is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional financing in upcoming periods, which\nmay not be available on acceptable terms to us, or at all. Failure to obtain necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our\ncommercial readiness efforts, activities to support a potential commercial launch following any approval of our product candidates, or other\noperations.\n● We have not generated any revenue from our development stage products, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue.\n● Our short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\n● Our success is contingent on raising additional capital, and our efforts to do so may fail. Even if successful, our future capital raising activities may\ndilute our current stockholders, restrict our operations, or cause us to relinquish proprietary rights.\nRisks Pertaining to our Business Strategy, Structure and Organization\n● Our future growth and success depend on our ability to successfully develop and, if approved, commercialize our product candidates, which we have\nyet to do.\n● Our future success is highly dependent on the successful development of our chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) engineered T cell (“CAR T”)\ntechnology and gene therapy product candidates.\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development and Commercialization\n● Preclinical development is highly speculative and carries a high failure risk.\n● We may not receive the required regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates on our projected timelines, if at all, which may result in\nincreased costs and delay our ability to generate revenue.\n● We may not obtain the desired labeling claims or intended uses for product promotion, or favorable scheduling classifications, to successfully promote\nour product candidates, if approved.\n● If a product candidate demonstrates adverse side effects, we may need to abandon or limit the development of such product candidate.\n● Even if a product candidate is approved, it may be subject to various post-marketing requirements, including studies or clinical trials, and increased\nregulatory scrutiny.\n● Our competitors may develop treatments for our products’ target indications, which could limit our product candidates’ commercial opportunity and\nprofitability.\n● If our product candidates, if approved, are not broadly accepted by the healthcare community, the revenues from any such product will likely be\nlimited.\n● Any successful products’ liability claims related to any of our current or future product candidates may cause us to incur substantial liability and limit\nthe commercialization of any such products.\n● Our gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate\ndevelopment and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval, if at all.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\n● We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform\nsatisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or complying with applicable regulatory requirements.\n● We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and may also do so for\ncommercialization, if and when our product candidates are approved.\n● We rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties, which may prove inaccurate or unreliable.\n4\nTable of Contents\n● We may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nRisks Relating to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\n● We operate in a heavily regulated industry, and we cannot predict the impact that any future legislation or administrative or executive action may have\non our operations.\n● We may be subject to anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and\nregulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and\ndiminished profits and future earnings.\n● We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that\ncould harm our business.\nRisks Pertaining to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes with Licensors Thereof\n● If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize\nproducts similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products could therefore be impaired.\n● We depend on our licensors to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights covering certain of our product candidates.\n● We or our licensors may be subject to costly and time-consuming litigation for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or to enforce our\nor our licensors’ intellectual property rights against third-party infringers.\n● Any dispute with our licensors may affect our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Relating to Our Control by Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”)\n● Fortress controls a voting majority of our common stock and has the right to receive significant share grants annually, which will result in dilution of\nour other stockholders and could reduce the value of our common stock.\n● We have entered into certain agreements with Fortress and may have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties.\n● We share certain directors with Fortress, which could create conflicts of interest between us and Fortress.\nRisks Relating to the Sale of Our Manufacturing Facility\n● We may be unable to complete the sale of our manufacturing facility as contemplated if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\n(“CFIUS”) determines to implement mitigation measures, including the potential divestment of some or all of the transferred assets by the buyer,\nwhich may limit our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings of the sale of the facility and may have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition.\n● Our receipt of the contingent portion of the consideration for the sale of the manufacturing facility is subject to receipt of the consent of the landlord of\nthe facility to the transfer of such lease to the buyer and our ability to raise additional capital.\n● Because the manufacturing facility was not transferred to the buyer within 120 days after Closing (as defined in the transaction documents), the buyer\nmay provide us with notice of its intentions to enter into negotiations for our repurchase of the facility, following which we will be obligated to\nnegotiate the repurchase of the facility from the buyer; there can be no guarantee that this repurchase happens on terms favorable to us, or at all.\n● The landlord may object to certain aspects of the transaction, which could result in expensive and time-consuming litigation and could prevent us from\nrealizing the intended benefits of the transaction.\n● If the sale of the facility is fully consummated, we will rely on the buyer for the manufacture of our lead product candidates, which may subject us to\nadditional manufacturing risks.\n● We may incur substantial expenses related to the transaction and the consummation of the sale of the facility.\n● Certain key personnel may depart the Company upon the completion of the sale of the facility, which may adversely affect our ability to realize the\nanticipated benefits of the transaction; unfortunately, key personnel may also depart our Company in the event that we are unable to complete the\ntransaction.\n● Our strategic pivot to our lead product candidate, MB-106, and our disposal of non-core assets, including our facility, may not result in the cost savings\nwe anticipate and could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1.

We aim to acquire rights to these\ntechnologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-\nlicensing or bringing the technologies to market.\nOur pipeline is currently focused in three core areas: CAR T therapies for hematologic malignancies, CAR T therapies for solid tumors and gene therapies for\nrare genetic disorders. For each therapy we have partnered with world class research institutions. For our CAR T therapies we have partnered with the City of\nHope National Medical Center (“COH” or “City of Hope”), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (“Fred Hutch”), Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”)\nand the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo Clinic”). For our gene therapies, we have partnered with St. Jude Children’s Research\nHospital (“St. Jude”) and with Leiden University Medical Centre (“LUMC”) in the development of first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral (“LV”) treatments for X-\nlinked severe combined immunodeficiency (“XSCID”) and RAG1 severe combined immunodeficiency (“RAG1-SCID”), respectively.\nCAR T Therapies\nOur pipeline of CAR T therapies is being developed under exclusive licenses from several world class research institutions. Our strategy is to license these\ntechnologies, support preclinical and clinical research activities by our partners and transfer the underlying technology to our or our contract manufacturer’s cell\nprocessing facility in order to conduct our own clinical trials.\nWe are developing CAR T therapy for hematologic malignancies in partnership with Fred Hutch targeting CD20 (MB-106). In May 2021, we announced that\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) accepted our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application for MB-106. As of December 2023,\napproximately 40 patients have been treated in an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by Fred Hutch (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729), and\napproximately 20 patients have been treated in an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by us (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05360238). In 2023, we\nreceived Safety Review Committee approval to continue dose escalation in all three active arms of the ongoing Mustang-sponsored phase 1 trial. We presented\nthe latest results, demonstrating a favorable safety profile, complete response rate, and durability, from the ongoing Mustang-sponsored phase 1 trial at the 2023\nAmerican Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting. As of December 31, 2023, the MB-106 Mustang-sponsored phase 1 trial is pending one patient to\ncomplete the final dose level required to advance to phase 2 pivotal studies for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma.\nWe are also developing CAR T therapy for solid tumors in partnership with COH targeting IL13Rα2 (MB-101). In addition, we have partnered with Nationwide\nfor a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus (MB-108) in order to enhance the activity of MB-101 for the treatment of patients with high-grade\nmalignant brain tumors. The Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by COH for MB-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02208362) has completed the treatment\nphase and patients continue to be assessed for long-term safety. A Phase 1 clinical trial sponsored by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (“UAB”) for\nMB-108 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03657576) began during the third quarter of 2019. In October 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted our IND\napplication for the combination of MB-101 and MB-108 – which is referred to as MB-109 – for the treatment of patients with IL13Rα2+relapsed or refractory\nglioblastoma (“GBM”) and high-grade astrocytoma.\nFinally, we are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop a novel technology that may be able to transform the administration of CAR T therapies and\npotentially be used as an off-the-shelf therapy. We are evaluating plans to file an IND application for a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial once a lead construct\nhas been identified, subject to allocation of resources.\nOn May 18, 2023, we announced a series of changes resulting from a review of our portfolio of product candidates to determine the future strategy of our\nprograms and the proper allocation of our resources. Following this review, we determined to discontinue development of our MB-102 (CD123), MB-103\n(HER2), MB-104 (CS1) and MB-105 (PSCA) programs (such programs, the “Discontinued Programs”), all of which were CAR T therapies being developed in\npartnership with City of Hope.\n6\nTable of Contents\nGene Therapies\nIn partnership with St. Jude, our XSCID gene therapy programs (MB-117 and MB-217) are being developed under an exclusive license to develop a potentially\ncurative treatment for XSCID, a rare genetic immune system condition in which affected patients do not live beyond infancy without treatment. For these\nprograms, the same lentiviral vector (LVV) will be used to transduce patients’ hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo. However, since the respective cell processing is\ndifferent for each cell product, the FDA considers them different products, and we have therefore assigned a different designation to each: MB-117 designates\nthe cell product for newborn patients, and MB-217 designates the cell product for previously transplanted patients.\nThe LVV used for MB-117 and MB-217 has been modified from a predecessor LVV in order to address concerns regarding detection of an increased percentage\nof clones in patients’ myeloid lineage following treatment with the predecessor products (designated MB-107 and MB-207, respectively) engineered using the\npredecessor LVV. Although a safety signal has not been observed in over 40 patients treated with the two predecessor products, nevertheless, out of an\nabundance of caution, we and our academic partners decided to replace the predecessor LVV with the modified LVV. We anticipate that the NIH and St. Jude\nwill initiate phase 1 trials in newborn and previously transplanted patients, respectively, in 2024 using the modified LVV to produce MB-117 and MB-217,\nrespectively.\nThe predecessor LVV has been utilized in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials involving two different autologous cell products produced via transduction of patients’\nhematopoietic stem cells. As noted above, these cell products were designated MB-107 and MB-207, and the respective Phase 1/2 clinical trials were: a\nmulticenter trial of the MB-107 product in newly diagnosed infants sponsored by St. Jude (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512888) and a single-center trial\nof the MB-207 product in previously transplanted patients sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nNCT01306019).\nIn January 2021, we received a safe to proceed “approval” from the FDA for our MB-107 IND application allowing us to initiate a pivotal non-randomized\nmulticenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-107 in newly diagnosed infants with XSCID who are under the age of two. In January 2022, the FDA issued a clinical\nhold, pending additional Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) data, on our IND application to allow for the initiation of a pivotal non-randomized\nmulticenter Phase 2 clinical trial of MB-207 in previously transplanted XSCID patients.\nIn 2022, the NIH study was suspended as a result of the study stopping rules triggered by the increased percentage of clones noted above. St. Jude elected to\nvoluntarily place their study on hold in April 2023, and we elected to voluntarily discontinue development of MB-107 and MB-207 in favor of MB-117 and\nMB-217 prior to treating any patients with either predecessor product. Both St. Jude and NIH intend to initiate their respective studies of MB-117 and MB-217\nin 2024 following availability of the modified LVV.\nMB-110, a first-in-class ex vivo treatment for RAG1 SCID, is currently being evaluated at LUMC in a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial in Europe. In 2022 the\nfirst patient was treated without any complications, after which the patient developed a functioning immune system which responded well to the standard\nvaccinations for newborns. In 2024, we expect that additional centers will be added and that additional patients will be enrolled.\nTo date, we have not received approval for the sale of any of our product candidates in any market and, therefore, have not generated any product sales from our\nproduct candidates. In addition, we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception, and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for\nthe foreseeable future and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2023, we have an accumulated deficit of $381.0 million.\nWe are a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc.

CD20 is a B-cell lineage-specific phosphoprotein that is expressed in high,\nhomogeneous density on the surface of more than 95% of B-cell NHL and CLL. CD20 is stable on the cell surface with minimal shedding, internalization, or\nmodulation upon antibody binding and is present at only nanomolar levels as a soluble antigen. It is well established as an effective immunotherapy target, with\nextensive studies demonstrating improved tumor responses and survival of B-NHL patients treated with rituximab and other anti-CD20 antibodies. Importantly,\nCD20 continues to be expressed on the lymphoma cells of most patients with relapsed B-NHL despite repetitive rituximab treatments, and loss of CD20\nexpression is not a major contributor to treatment resistance. Thus, there is strong rationale for testing CD20 CAR T cells as an immunotherapy for NHL.\nMore than 80,000 new cases of NHL are diagnosed each year in the United States, and over 20,000 patients die of this group of diseases annually. Most forms\nof NHL, including follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma\n(“SLL”), which account collectively for approximately 45% of all cases of NHL, are incurable with available therapies, except for allogenic stem cell transplant\n(“allo-SCT”). However, many NHL patients are not suitable candidates for allo-SCT, and this treatment is also limited by significant rates of morbidity and\nmortality due to graft-versus-host disease. Aggressive B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common subtype of lymphoma,\naccount for an additional 30-35% of NHL. The majority of patients with aggressive B-NHL are successfully treated with combination chemotherapy, but a\nsignificant proportion relapse or have refractory disease, and the outcome of these patients is poor. Innovative new treatments are therefore urgently needed.\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a mature B cell neoplasm characterized by a progressive accumulation of\nmonoclonal B lymphocytes. CLL is considered to be identical (i.e., one disease with different manifestations) to the NHL SLL. The malignant cells seen in CLL\nand SLL have identical pathologic and immunophenotypic features. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the blood, whereas the term\nSLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal.\nCLL is the most common leukemia in adults in Western countries, accounting for approximately 25 to 35 percent of all leukemias in the United States. An\nestimated 20,700 new cases of CLL will be diagnosed in the United States in 2024. CLL is considered to be mainly a disease afflicting older adults, with a\nmedian age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years; however, it is not unusual to make this diagnosis in younger individuals (e.g., from approximately 30 to 39\nyears of age). The incidence increases rapidly with increasing age. The natural history of CLL is extremely variable, with survival times from initial diagnosis\nthat range from approximately 2 to 20 years, and a median survival of approximately 10 years.\nMost patients will have a complete or partial response to initial therapy. However, conventional therapy for CLL is not curative and most patients experience\nrelapse. In addition, many patients will require a change in therapy due to intolerance. Since patients with CLL are generally elderly with a median age older\nthan 70 years, and due to the relatively benign course of the disease in the majority of patients, only selected patients are candidates for intensive treatments\nsuch as allo-SCT. Innovative new treatments with a favorable safety profile are therefore urgently needed for patients with relapsed and refractory disease.\nUnder their IND, Fred Hutch is currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering CD20-directed\nthird-generation CAR T cells incorporating both 4-1BB and CD28 co-stimulatory signaling domains (MB-106) to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell\nNHL or CLL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03277729). Secondary endpoints of this study include safety and toxicity, preliminary antitumor activity as\nmeasured by overall response rate and complete remission rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The study is also assessing CAR T cell\npersistence and the potential immunogenicity of the cells. Finally, this study was designed so that, together with Fred Hutch, we could determine a\nrecommended Phase 2 dose. Fred Hutch intends to enroll approximately 50 subjects in this study, which is being led by the Principal Investigator Mazyar\nShadman, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Fred Hutch’s Clinical Research Division.\nThe Fred Hutch IND was amended in 2019 to incorporate an optimized manufacturing process that had been developed in collaboration with us.\nIn May 2021, we announced that the FDA issued a safe to proceed letter for our IND application allowing for initiation of a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical study\nof MB-106 in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell NHL or CLL (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05360238). In August 2022, the first patient was treated\nin our study.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2021, Mustang was awarded a grant of approximately $2.0 million from NCI of the National Institutes of Health. This two-year award partially\nfunded the Mustang-sponsored multicenter trial to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-106. In August 2023, we fully utilized the grant.\nIn June 2022, MB-106 received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (“WM”).\nIn December 2023, Mustang presented preliminary clinical data for the indolent lymphoma patients treated in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study at the\nAmerican Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting. All 9 patients responded clinically to treatment; the observed overall response rate was 100%. All 5\nfollicular lymphoma patients achieved a complete response. Among the WN patients 1 patient attained a very good partial response, and 2 patients attained a\npartial response. The single patient with a hairy cell leukemia variant experienced stable disease. The safety profile demonstrated that MB-106 was well\ntolerated with no occurrences of cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) above grade 1, and no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”)\nof any grade was reported. Cell expansion and persistence were also demonstrated.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects to receive FDA feedback in an End-of-Phase 1 Meeting on its strategy to conduct a non-randomized\nregistrational multicenter trial in relapsed or refractory WM. In the second half of 2024, the Company expects to treat the first patient in that trial, which could\nenable top-line results in the second half of 2026. In order to facilitate interactions with the FDA throughout this process, we anticipate requesting Regenerative\nMedicine Advanced Therapy (‘RMAT’) designation for indolent lymphoma – which includes WM – from the FDA in the first half of 2024. We are currently\nevaluating the extent to which we can continue the development of MB-106 in other NHL subtypes, subject to allocation of resources.\nMB-109: Combination MB-101(IL13Rα2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma) and MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus C134) as a Potential Treatment for\nIL13Rα2+ Relapsed or Refractory Glioblastoma (GBM) and High-Grade Astrocytoma.\nAn attractive novel approach to control glioblastoma is adoptive cellular immunotherapy utilizing CAR T cells. CAR T cells can be engineered to recognize\nvery specific antigenically distinct tumor populations and to migrate through the brain parenchyma to kill malignant cells. In addition, oncolytic viruses\n(“OVs”) have been developed to effectively infect and kill cancer cells in the tumor, as well as modify the microenvironment to increase tumor immunogenicity\nand immune cell trafficking within the tumor. Due to these properties, OVs have been studied in combination with other treatments to enhance the effectiveness\nof immunotherapies.\nPreliminary anti-tumor activity has been observed in clinical studies administering the OV (MB-108) and CAR T cell therapy (MB-101) as single agents;\nhowever, the combination has not yet been explored. To determine if the combination of both therapies will result in a synergistic effect, investigators from\nCOH developed preclinical studies in orthotopic GBM models in nude mice. Dr. Christine Brown from City of Hope presented these preclinical studies at the\nAmerican Association for Cancer Research 2022 Annual Meeting. It was observed that co-treatment with HSV-1 OV and IL13Rα2-directed CAR-T cells\nresulted in no additional adverse events beyond those seen with the individual therapies, and, more notably, that pre-treatment with HSV-1 OV re-shaped the\ntumor microenvironment by increasing immune cell infiltrates and enhanced the efficacy of sub-therapeutic doses of IL13Rα2-directed CAR-T cell therapy\ndelivered either intraventricularly or intratumorally. These preclinical studies aimed to provide a deeper understanding of this combination approach to support\nthe potential benefit of a combination study that will evaluate HSV-1 OV (MB-108) and IL13Rα2-directed CAR-T cells (MB-101).\nIn October 2023, we received a safe-to-proceed “approval” from the FDA for our MB-109 IND application allowing us to initiate a Phase 1, open-label, non-\nrandomized, multicenter study of MB-109 in patients with IL13Rα2+ recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytoma. In this Phase 1 clinical study, we intend to\nevaluate the combination of CAR-T cells (MB-101) and the herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic virus (MB-108) in patients with IL13Rα2+ high-grade\ngliomas. The design of this study involves first a lead in cohort, wherein patients are treated with MB-101 alone without prior MB-108 administration. After\nsuccessful confirmation of the safety profile of MB-101 alone, the study will then investigate increasing doses of intratumorally administered MB-108 followed\nby dual intratumoral (ICT) and intraventricular (ICV) administration of MB-101. We are currently evaluating the extent to which we can initiate this study,\nsubject to allocation of resources.\nMB-101 (IL13Rα2 CAR T Cell Program for Glioblastoma)\nGBM is the most common brain and central nervous system (“CNS”) cancer, accounting for approximately 49.1% of malignant primary brain and CNS tumors,\napproximately 54% of all gliomas, and approximately 16% of all primary brain and CNS tumors. More than 14,490 new GBM cases were predicted to be\ndiagnosed in the U.S. for 2023. Malignant brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in adolescents and young adults aged 15-39 and\nthe most common cancer occurring among 15-19-year-olds in the U.S. While GBM is a rare disease 2-3 cases per 100,000 persons per year in the U.S. and\nEuropean Union (“EU”), it is quite lethal, with five-year survival rate historically under 10%, which has been virtually unchanged for decades. Standard of care\ntherapy consists of maximal surgical resection,\n9\nTable of Contents\nradiation, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, which, while rarely curative, is shown to extend median overall survival from 4.5 to 15 months. GBM remains\ndifficult to treat due to the inherent resistance of the tumor to conventional therapies.\nImmunotherapy approaches targeting brain tumors offer promise over conventional treatments. IL13Rα2 is an attractive target for CAR T therapy, as it has\nlimited expression in normal tissue but is overexpressed on the surface of greater than 50% of GBM tumors. CAR-T cells are designed to express membrane-\ntethered IL-13 receptor ligand (“IL-13”) mutated at a single site (glutamic acid at position 13 to a tyrosine; E13Y) with high affinity for IL13Rα2 and reduced\nbinding to IL13Rα1 in order to reduce healthy tissue targeting (Kahlon KS et al. Cancer Research. 2004;64:9160-9166).\nWe are developing an optimized CAR-T product incorporating enhancements in CAR-T design and T cell engineering to improve antitumor potency and T cell\npersistence. These include a second-generation hinge-optimized CAR containing mutations in the IgG4 linker to reduce off-target Fc interactions (Jonnalagadda\nM et al. Molecular Therapy. 2015;23(4):757-768.), a 4-1BB (CD137) co-stimulatory signaling domain for improved survival and maintenance of CAR T cells,\nand the extracellular domain of CD19 as a selection/tracking marker. In order to further improve persistence, either central memory T-cells (T ) or enriched\nCM\nCD62L+ naïve and memory T cells (T ) are isolated and enriched. Our manufacturing process limits ex vivo expansion, which is designed to reduce T cell\nN/MEM\nexhaustion and maintain a T or T phenotype. Based on experiments with CAR-Ts in mouse xenograft models of GBM, these CAR-modified T and\nCM N/MEM CM\nT cells have been shown to be more potent and persistent than earlier generations of CAR-T cells.\nN/MEM\nOur academic partners at COH have recently completed the treatment phase of their Phase 1 study, which was designed to assess the feasibility and safety of\nusing T or T enriched IL13Rα2-specific CAR-engineered T cells for clinical study participants with IL13Rα2 recurrent/refractory malignant glioma\nCM N/MEM\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02208362). In this study, COH enrolled and treated 65 patients, with 58 patients receiving 3 cycles of CAR T cells per the\nstudy protocol. In March 2024, results from this study were published in Nature Medicine. Preliminary data indicated that the CAR-T cells were well tolerated,\nand no dose-limiting toxicities were observed in any of the study arms nor where there any occurrences of CRS or treatment-related deaths. Of the 58 patients\nevaluable for disease response, 50% achieved stable disease (SD) or better; 22%, including 8 patients with grade 4 gliomas, achieved SD or better for at least 90\ndays. Two patients achieved partial response, and one patient achieved complete response on the study. In 2016 COH reported that a patient had achieved a\ncomplete response to treatment based on the imaging and clinical features set forth by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (“RANO”). This\nresult was published as a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine (Brown CE et al. NEJM. 2016;375:2561-9). As described in the paper, this patient\ndiagnosed with recurrent multifocal glioblastoma received multiple infusions of IL13Rα2-specific CAR-T cells over 220 days through two intracranial delivery\nroutes – infusions into the resected tumor cavity followed by infusions into the ventricular system. Intracranial infusions of IL13Rα2-targeted CAR-T cells were\nnot associated with any toxic effects of grade 3 or higher. After CAR-T cell treatment, regression of all intracranial and spinal tumors was observed, along with\ncorresponding increases in levels of cytokines and immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. This clinical response was sustained for 7.5 months after the\ninitiation of CAR T-cell therapy; however, the patient’s disease eventually recurred at four new locations that were distinct and non-adjacent to the original\ntumors, and biopsy of one of these lesions showed decreased expression of IL13Rα2.\nResults from this COH study have laid the foundation for three new MB-101 studies:\n1. MB-101 with or without nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma (currently enrolling patients;\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04003649) sponsored by COH;\n2. MB-101 in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma with a substantial component of leptomeningeal disease (currently enrolling\npatients; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04661384) sponsored by COH;\n3. MB101 in combination with the herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic virus (MB108) in treating patients with recurrent or refractory glioblastoma or\nhigh-grade astrocytoma, as described above. This combination therapy, to be administered in a phase 1 two-center trial under our IND, will be referred\nto as MB-109.\nMB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus C134)\nMB-108 is a next-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (“oHSV”) that is conditionally replication competent; that is, it can replicate in tumor cells, but not\nin normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this process. Replication of C134 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells but\ncauses the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are released as the tumor cell dies and can then proceed to infect other tumor\ncells in the vicinity and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic activity, the virus promotes an immune response against surviving\ntumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy. The virus expresses a gene from another virus from the same overall virus family, human\ncytomegalovirus, which allows it to replicate better\n10\nTable of Contents\nin the tumor cells than its first-generation predecessors. However, the virus has also been genetically engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects\nfor the patient receiving the therapy.\nTo improve this virus over its first-generation predecessors, modifications have focused on improving viral replication and spread within the tumor bed and on\nenhancing bystander damage to uninfected tumor cells. These effects cumulatively should result in converting an immunologically cold tumor to an\nimmunologically hot tumor, which we anticipate will increase the efficacy of our IL13Rα2-directed CAR T for the treatment of GBM and high-grade\nastrocytoma.\nThe O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at the UAB is the single clinical trial site for the Phase 1 trial of MB-108, and this site has initiated a Phase 1 trial\nthat began enrolling patients in 2019 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03657576). The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and\ntolerability of a single dose of MB-108 administered via a stereotactic intracerebral injection and to determine the maximally tolerated dose (“MTD”) of the\noncolytic virus. Secondary objectives are to obtain preliminary information about the potential benefit of MB-108 in the treatment of patients with recurrent\nmalignant gliomas, including relevant data on markers of efficacy, including time to tumor progression and patient survival. As of April 2023, 9 patients had\nbeen enrolled in this study.\nIn Vivo CAR T Platform Technology\nWe are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop a novel technology that may be able to transform the administration of CAR T therapies and potentially\nbe used as an off-the-shelf therapy. The technology, developed by Larry R. Pease, Ph.D., principal investigator and former director of the Center for\nImmunology and Immune Therapies at Mayo Clinic, is a new platform to administer CAR T therapy using a two-step approach. First, a peptide is administered\nto the patient to drive the proliferation of the patient’s resident T cells. This is followed by the administration of a viral CAR construct directly into the lymph\nnodes of the patient. In turn, the viral construct infects the activated T cells and effectively forms CAR T cells in vivo in the patient. Successful implementation\nmay lead to an off-the-shelf product with no need to isolate and expand patient T cells ex vivo in a cell processing facility.\nPreclinical proof-of-concept has been established, and the ongoing development of this technology will take place at Mayo Clinic. We are evaluating plans to\nfile an IND application for a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial once a lead construct has been identified, subject to allocation of resources.\nGene Therapies for Rare Genetic Disorders\nMB-117 and MB-217 (designation of MB-107 and MB-207, respectively, following replacement of the predecessor LVV with a modified LVV) (Ex vivo\nLentiviral Therapy for X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID))\nXSCID is a rare genetic immune system condition that occurs almost exclusively in males, in which affected patients do not live beyond infancy without\ntreatment. Mustang Bio’s first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for XSCID has been administered as two distinct cellular products using the same\npredecessor lentiviral vector in two phase 1/2 clinical trials: (1) a multicenter trial of MB-107 in newly diagnosed patients being led by St. Jude and including\nalso UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital San Francisco (“UCSF”) and Seattle Children’s Hospital (“Seattle Children’s”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:\nNCT01512888) and (2) a single center trial of MB-207 at the NIH in patients who have previously undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\n(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019). In 2022, the NIH study was suspended as a result of the study stopping rules triggered by the increased\npercentage of clones in patients’ myeloid lineage, as noted above. St. Jude elected to voluntarily place their study on hold in April 2023, and we elected to\nvoluntarily discontinue development of MB-107 and MB-207 in favor of MB-117 and MB-217 prior to treating any patients with either predecessor product. All\npatients treated in the St. Jude and NIH clinical trials continue to be followed and remain clinically stable with no significant hematological anomalies,\nincluding no observations of insertional mutagenesis and/or malignancies. Both St. Jude and NIH intent to initiate their respective studies of MB-117 and MB-\n217 in 2024 following availability of the modified LVV.\nAs part of addressing concerns relating to clonal expansion, the joint team existing of St. Jude, UCSF, Seattle Children’s and the NIH decided to suspend use of\nthe primary lentiviral vector. Going forward, this predecessor LV vector will be replaced by a modified LV vector which will be used to produce the MB-117\nand MB-217 cell products. St Jude has informed us that it intends to initiate a new Phase 1 trial in newly diagnosed infants using MB-117, and the NIH has\ninformed us that it intends to initiate a new Phase 1 trial in previously transplanted patients using MB-217, each in 2024.\n11\nTable of Contents\nMB-110 (Ex vivo Lentiviral Therapy for RAG1 Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID))\nUnder an exclusive license and in partnership with LUMC, MB-110, a first-in-class ex vivo treatment for RAG1 SCID, is under development. Severe combined\nimmunodeficiency (“SCID”) due to complete recombinase-activating gene-1 (RAG1) deficiency is a rare, genetic disorder due to null mutations in the RAG1\ngene resulting in less than 1% of wild type V(D)J recombination activity. Neonatal patients present with life-threatening, severe, recurrent infections by\nopportunistic fungal, viral and bacterial micro-organisms, as well as skin rashes, chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive and fever. Immunologic observations include\nprofound T and B cell lymphopenia, low or absent serum immunoglobulins, and normal natural killer cell counts. As is the case with other types of SCID,\nRAG1-SCID is fatal in infancy unless immune reconstitution is achieved with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).\nMB-110, which includes low-dose conditioning prior to reinfusion of the patients’ own gene-modified blood stem cells, is currently being evaluated in a Phase\n1/2 multicenter clinical trial in Europe. The ongoing clinical trial has enrolled its first patient, and additional clinical sites are expected to be added in the near\nfuture. The RAG1-SCID program has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the European Medicines Agency.\nWe also established an ongoing partnership with Frank J. Staal, Ph.D., professor of Molecular Stem Cell Biology and molecular immunologist at LUMC, whose\nlaboratory developed the MB-110 therapy. Dr. Staal will continue the development of additional LV gene therapies in his lab, to which we have certain rights\nunder the agreement.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS\nGeneral\nOur goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our\ntrade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to\nobtain, where appropriate, the broad intellectual property protection for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a\ncombination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.\nWe also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other\ncontractors (“know-how”). To help protect our proprietary know-how which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce,\nwe rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and other\ncontractors to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and\nassignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions that they generate or make, and which are important to our business.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized\nuse by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are\neffectively maintained as trade secrets. We own or exclusively license a few patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technologies,\nbut we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the\npending patent applications will issue as patents.\nGenerally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and\npharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in\nbiotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file\npatent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings declared by the\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is\nfavorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we\ncommercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any\nadvantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended\nthrough the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal. Additionally, statutory caps impose further limitation on any such\nextensions.\n12\nTable of Contents\nIf a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and\nenforceable, we may be required to obtain a license, if available, under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation\ninvolving a third party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the\ndisputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to\ntechnology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to\nus or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. Litigation would not only involve substantial costs but would also involve substantial\ntime commitments on the part of our key executives and research and development personnel.\nIn March 2015, we licensed intellectual property related to CAR T technology from COH. In May 2023, we announced a series of changes resulting from a\nreview of our portfolio of product candidates to determine the future strategy of our programs and the proper allocation of our resources. Following this review,\nwe determined to discontinue development of our MB-102 (CD123), MB-103 (HER2), MB-104 (CS1) and MB-105 (PSCA) programs and terminated the\nassociated license agreements. The portfolio of rights licensed from COH now includes patents and applications directed to CARs targeting IL13Rα2, as well as\nrights related to modified CAR hinge regions, methods of preparing CAR T cells in particular subpopulations of cells and methods of administering CAR T\ncells. The intellectual property licensed thereunder relating to IL13Rα2-targeting CARs includes granted patents in the U.S., Australia, China, Europe, Russia,\nJapan, Hong Kong, Israel, and Mexico, and this patent family further includes pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, South\nKorea, Russia, Japan, Israel, Mexico, and New Zealand. Any patents issuing from the IL13Rα2-targeting CAR will expire no sooner than 2035. The licensed\nintellectual property relating to relating modified CAR hinge regions includes issues patents in China, Europe, and Japan, as well as pending applications in the\nU.S., Australia, China, and Europe. The patents issuing from the modified CAR hinge region family will expire no sooner than 2034. The licensed intellectual\nproperty relating to relating to method of preparing or administering CAR T cells includes issues patents in China, Europe, and Japan, as well as pending\napplications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Israel, Mexico, Russia, and New Zealand. The patents relating to these\ntechnologies will expire no sooner than 2035 or, in the case of the administration methods, 2036.\nAlso, in March 2015, we executed a sponsored research agreement with COH, pursuant to which research is performed in the laboratory of Drs. Stephen\nForman and Christine Brown. The sponsored research agreement gives us the right to first negotiation under specified maximum terms regarding any future\ninventions arising from the laboratory.\nIn May 2017, we licensed intellectual property related to CAR T technology for targeting CD20 from Fred Hutch. The intellectual property includes an\ninternational application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (i.e., a PCT application), which has now matured into several issued patents, including issued\npatents in the U.S. and Europe, as well as pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea,\nMexico, New Zealand, and Russia. These applications contain claims relating to various CD20-targeting CAR constructs and CAR T cells, as well as methods\nof making and using the same. The national stage applications claiming priority to the PCT application were filed in May 2018 in order to begin substantive\nexamination of the claims. Patents maturing from these national stage applications will expire no sooner than March 2037.\nIn March 2017, we licensed intellectual property related to antibodies and binding agents that specifically bind to PSCA from the University of California Los\nAngeles (“UCLA”). In August 2023, we terminated the license agreement with UCLA.\nIn August 2018, we licensed from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital XSCID Technology related to an ex vivo lentiviral vector gene therapy program to\nprovide a normal copy of the IL2RG gene to patients born with XSCID.\nIn February 2019, we licensed material and technical information related to the HSV-1 oncolytic virus C134 from Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn August 2019, we licensed from CSL Behring (Calimmune) the CytegrityTM stable producer cell line developed and used by St. Jude. The CytegrityTM stable\nproducer cell line was developed in order to be used to produce the viral vector for MB-107 and MB-207. However, the decision to modify the LVV used to\ntransduce the hematopoietic stem cells of XSCID patients and thereby replace MB-107 and MB-207 with MB-117 and MB-217, respectively, rendered the\nstable producer cell no longer useful. Therefore, on August 14, 2023, we notified Calimmune that we were terminating the Calimmune license, which took\neffect 60 days following notification.\nIn September 2020, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with SIRION Biotech for the rights to SIRION’s LentiBOOSTTM technology\nfor the development of MB-207. This license includes right to granted patents and pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Israel. In December\n2021 this licensing agreement was amended to include CD20-directed CAR Ts in addition to lentiviral stem cell gene therapy for the treatment of XSCID. We\neventually expect to use this technology for the development of MB-217.\n13\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2021, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Leiden University Medical Centre for a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral\ngene therapy for the treatment of RAG1 severe combined immunodeficiency (“RAG1-SCID”).\nIn August 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mayo Clinic for a novel technology that may be able to transform the administration of\nCAR T therapies and potentially allow such therapies to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy.\nIn addition to the technology we have in-licensed, we also developed our own proprietary intellectual property, both alone and in conjunction with COH. In\nparticular, we filed a U.S. provisional application directed to optimized methods for manufacturing cell-based therapeutics, and we and COH, as co-applicants,\nfiled a U.S. provisional application directed to methods of treating hematological cancers.\nIn addition to the technology we have in-licensed, we have also developed our own proprietary intellectual property, both alone and in conjunction with COH.\nIn particular, we own pending applications in the U.S. and Europe directed to methods for manufacturing cell-based therapeutics, and pending PCT applications,\nand applications in the U.S. and Taiwan, relating to anti-idiotype antibodies. We and COH also own, as co-applicants, pending PCT applications, and\napplications in the U.S. and Taiwan, directed to methods of treating hematological cancers with a combination therapy.\nOther Intellectual Property Rights\nWe depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the\nconfidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement\nof a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to\nassign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed\nin connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized\ndisclosure of such information.\nIn addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended (the\n“FDCA”), to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology\ncompanies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the\nU.S., or diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. but for which the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under\nthese provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first approval of a designated orphan product from the\nFDA will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA approved orphan product.\nLICENSE, CLINICAL TRIAL AND SPONSORED RESEARCH AGREEMENTS\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital\nXSCID License\nOn August 2, 2018, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with St. Jude for the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral gene\ntherapy for the treatment of XSCID. We paid $1.0 million in consideration for the exclusive license in addition to an annual maintenance fee of $0.1 million\n(beginning in 2019). St. Jude is eligible to receive payments totaling $13.5 million upon the achievement of five development and commercialization\nmilestones. Royalty payments in the mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products (e.g. MB-117 and MB-217).\nXSCID Non-interventional Services Agreement\nIn December 2019, we entered into a Non-Interventional Services Agreement with Children's CGMP, LLC (“Children’s”), an affiliate of St. Jude Children's\nResearch Hospital, pursuant to which Children’s provides lentiviral vector for non-clinical XSCID research purposes, as well as related advisory services, and\nwe agreed to fund approximately $0.8 million upon execution.\n14\nTable of Contents\nXSCID Data Transfer Agreement\nIn June 2020, we entered into a Data Transfer Agreement for the XSCID program (the “XSCID DTA”). Pursuant to the terms of the XSCID DTA, we made an\nupfront payment of approximately $1.1 million and will reimburse St. Jude for additional costs in connection with the on-going investigator-initiated study.\nCity of Hope National Medical Center\nIn February 2017, we and COH amended and restated our license agreement, dated March 17, 2015 (the “Original COH Agreement”), by entering into three\nseparate amended and restated exclusive license agreements, one relating to the CD123-directed CAR T program, one relating to the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T\nprogram, and one relating to the Spacer technology (described below). As of December 31, 2023, COH owns 845,385 shares of our Class A common stock,\nwhich are convertible into 56,359 shares of Common Stock, and has the right to appoint a member to our Board of Directors (the “Board”).\nIn addition, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with COH under which we have funded continued research in the amount of $2.0 million per year,\npayable in four equal installments, which ended in the first quarter of 2020. The research covered under this arrangement was for the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T\nprogram, the CD123-directed CAR T program, and the Spacer technology.\nIn May 2023, we announced a series of changes resulting from a review of our portfolio of product candidates to determine the future strategy of our programs\nand the proper allocation of our resources. Following this review, we determined to discontinue development of the Discontinued Programs, which included a\nportion of our portfolio of CAR T therapies being developed by us in partnership with the City of Hope.\nIL13Rα2 License\nIn February 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with COH to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to patent\nrights related to the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T program (the “IL13Rα2 License”). Pursuant to the IL13Rα2 License, we and COH acknowledged that an upfront\nfee had already been paid under the Original COH Agreement. In addition, COH is eligible to receive an annual maintenance fee, milestone payments totaling\nup to approximately $14.5 million, and royalties on net sales of licensed products in the mid-single digits. We are obligated to pay COH a percentage of certain\nrevenues received in connection with a sublicense ranging from the mid-teens to mid-thirties, depending on the timing of the sublicense in the development of\nany product.\nIL13Rα2 CRA (Glioblastoma)\nIn February 2017, we entered into a Clinical Research Support Agreement for the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T program (the “IL13Rα2 GBM CRA”). Pursuant to\nthe terms of the IL13Rα2 CRA, we made an upfront payment of approximately $9,000 and will contribute an additional $140,000 per patient in connection with\nthe on-going investigator-initiated study. Further, we agreed to fund approximately $66,000 annually pertaining to the clinical development of the IL13Rα2-\ndirected CAR T therapy (also known as MB-101).\nIL13Rα2 CRA (Leptomeningeal Glioblastoma)\nIn October 2020, we entered into a Clinical Research Support Agreement for the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T program for adult patients with leptomeningeal\nglioblastoma, ependymoma or medulloblastoma (the “IL13Rα2 Leptomeningeal CRA”). Pursuant to the terms of the IL13Rα2 Leptomeningeal CRA, we made\nan upfront payment of approximately $29,000 and will contribute an additional $150,000 per patient in connection with the on-going investigator-initiated\nstudy. Further, we agreed to fund approximately $200,000 annually pertaining to the clinical development of the IL13Rα2-directed CAR T therapy.\n15\nTable of Contents\nSponsored Research Agreement - IL13Rα2 and C134 Combination\nIn October 2020, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) with COH to conduct combination studies of a potential IL13Rα2 CAR and C134\noncolytic virus therapy (also known as MB-108). In November 2022, the SRA was amended to include additional funding. Pursuant to the amended SRA, we\nfunded research in total of $0.9 million for the program.\nSpacer License\nIn February 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement with COH to acquire intellectual property rights pertaining to patent\nrights related to Spacer (the “Spacer License”). Pursuant to the Spacer License, COH will receive an annual maintenance fee of $10,000. No royalties are due if\nthe Spacer technology is used in conjunction with an IL13Rα2 CAR, and royalty payments in the low single digits are due on net sales of licensed products if\nthe Spacer technology is used in conjunction with other intellectual property. We are obligated to pay COH a percentage of certain revenues received in\nconnection with a sublicense in the mid-thirties.\nIV/ICV License\nIn February 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “IV/ICV License”) with COH to acquire intellectual property rights in patent applications\nrelated to the intraventricular and intracerebroventricular methods of delivering T cells that express CARs. Pursuant to the IV/ICV License, in March 2017, we\npaid COH an upfront fee of $0.1 million. COH is eligible to receive a milestone payment totaling approximately $0.1 million, upon and subject to the\nachievement of a milestone, and an annual maintenance fee. Royalty payments in the low single digits are due on net sales of licensed products. We are\nobligated to pay COH a percentage of certain revenues received in connection with a sublicense in the mid-thirties.\nManufacturing License\nOn January 3, 2018, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with COH to acquire patent and licensed know-how rights related to developing,\nmanufacturing, and commercializing licensed products. We paid $75,000 in consideration for the licenses to the patent rights and the licensed know-how in\naddition to an annual maintenance fee. Royalty payments in the low-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products.\nUniversity of California License\nOn March 17, 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents of UCLA (the “UCLA License”) to acquire intellectual property rights in\npatent applications related to the engineered anti-prostate stem cell antigen antibodies for cancer targeting and detection. Pursuant to the UCLA License, we\npaid UCLA an upfront fee of $0.2 million and owed annual maintenance fees. In addition, UCLA was eligible to receive milestone payments totaling up to\n$14.3 million, and royalty payments in the mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products. On July 10, 2023, we notified UCLA that we were\nterminating the UCLA license, which took effect on August 9, 2023.\nFred Hutchinson Cancer Center\nCD20 Technology License\nEffective July 3, 2017, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Fred Hutch for the use of a CAR T therapy related to autologous T\ncells engineered to express a CD20-specific CAR (the “CD20 Technology License”). Pursuant to the CD20 Technology License, we paid Fred Hutch an upfront\nfee of $0.3 million and owes an annual maintenance fee of $50,000 on each anniversary of the license until our achievement of regulatory approval of a licensed\nproduct using the CD20 Technology. Additional payments are due for the achievement of development milestones totaling $39.1 million. Royalty payments in\nthe mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products.\nCD20 CTA (NHL and CLL)\nAlso, on July 3, 2017, in conjunction with the CD20 Technology License from Fred Hutch, we entered into an investigator-initiated clinical trial agreement (the\n“CD20 CTA”) to provide partial funding for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial at Fred Hutch evaluating the safety and efficacy of the CD20 Technology in patients with\nrelapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (“NHLs”). In connection with the CD20 CTA, we agreed to fund up to $5.3 million of costs associated\nwith the clinical trial, which commenced during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2020, the CD20 CTA was amended to include additional funding of approximately $1.8 million, and in January 2022, the CTA was amended to\nincrease funding by approximately $2.2 million for the treatment of additional patients.\nNationwide Children’s Hospital License\nOn February 20, 2019, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Nationwide for the development of an oncolytic virus (referred to by\nNationwide as C134; now referred to by us as MB-108) for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. We paid $0.2 million in consideration for the exclusive\nlicense. Nationwide is eligible to receive additional payments totaling $77.5 million upon the achievement of development and commercialization milestones.\nRoyalty payments in the low-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products.\nCSL Behring (Calimmune) License\nOn August 23, 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with CSL Behring (Calimmune) for the CytegrityTM stable producer cell line for the\nproduction of lentiviral gene therapy for the XSCID gene therapy program. The CytegritTM stable producer cell line was used to produce the predecessor LVV\nfor our MB-107 and MB-207 lentiviral gene therapies for the treatment of XSCID. We paid $0.2 million in consideration for the license. CSL Behring\n(Calimmune) was eligible to receive additional payments totaling $1.2 million upon the achievement of development and commercialization milestones.\nRoyalty payments in the low-single digits were due on net sales of licensed products. However, the decision to modify the LVV used to transduce the\nhematopoietic stem cells of XSCID patients and thereby replace MB-107 and MB-207 with MB-117 and MB-217, respectively, rendered the stable producer\ncell no longer useful. Therefore, on August 14, 2023, we notified Calimmune that we were terminating the Calimmune license, which took effect 60 days\nfollowing notification.\nSIRION Biotech License\nOn October 6, 2020, we announced a licensing agreement under which we acquired technology rights from SIRION Biotech GmbH (“SIRION”) for\nLentiBOOST™ technology for the development of MB-207, our predecessor lentiviral gene therapy for the treatment of patients with XSCID, who have been\npreviously treated with a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (“HSCT”) and for whom re-treatment is indicated. LentiBOOST™ is SIRION’s proprietary\nnon-cytotoxic transduction enhancer for lentiviral vectors. We eventually expect to use this technology for the development of MB-217, the cell product that\nuses a modified LVV to transduce the hematopoietic stem cells of patients previously treated with an HSCT.\nPursuant to the agreement, we paid SIRION a one-time upfront fee of $0.1 million. In addition, SIRION is eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to\napproximately $9.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones. Royalty payments in the low- to mid-single digits\nare due on aggregate cumulative worldwide net sales of licensed products.\nIn December 2021, this licensing agreement was amended to include CD20-directed CAR Ts. SIRION is eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to\napproximately $9.1 million upon the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones for the additional product.\nMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\nCAR T Technology License\nOn August 12, 2021, we announced that we executed an exclusive license agreement with Mayo Clinic for a novel technology that may be able to transform the\nadministration of CAR T therapies and potentially allow such therapies to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy.\nThe technology, developed by Larry R. Pease, Ph.D., principal investigator and former director of the Center for Immunology and Immune Therapies at Mayo\nClinic, is a new platform to administer CAR T therapy using a two-step approach. First, a peptide is administered to the patient to drive the proliferation of the\npatient’s resident T cells. This is followed by the administration of a viral CAR construct directly into the lymph nodes of the patient. In turn, the viral construct\ninfects the activated T cells and effectively forms CAR T cells in vivo in the patient. Successful implementation may lead to an off-the-shelf product with no\nneed to isolate and expand patient T cells ex vivo.\nPreclinical proof-of-concept has been established, and the ongoing development of this technology will take place at Mayo Clinic. We are evaluating plans to\nfile an IND application for a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial once a lead construct has been identified, subject to allocation of resources.\n17\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to this agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $0.8 million and will pay an annual maintenance fee of $25,000. Additional payments are due for each of\ntwo licensed products upon the achievement of development and commercial milestones totaling up to $92.6 million per product, and royalty payments in the\nmid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products.\nSponsored Research Agreement\nIn connection with the Mayo Clinic license agreement, we entered into an SRA under which we will fund research supporting the CAR T Technology License in\nthe amount of $2.1 million over a period of two years. In October 2022, the SRA was amended to include additional funding of $0.1 million.\nLeiden University Medical Centre\nRAG1-SCID Technology License\nOn November 10, 2021, we announced an exclusive license agreement with Leiden University Medical Centre (“LUMC”) for a novel ex vivo lentiviral gene\ntherapy for the treatment of RAG1 severe combined immunodeficiency (“RAG1-SCID”).\nPursuant to this agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $0.4 million. Additional payments are due for the achievement of development and commercial milestones\ntotaling up to $31.0 million, and royalty payments in the low to mid-single digits are due on net sales of licensed products.\nSponsored Research Agreement\nIn connection with the RAG1-SCID license, we entered into an SRA with LUMC under which we fund research supporting the program in the amount of 2.3\nmillion euros over a period of five years.\nCOMPETITION\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as\nwell as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial\ncompetition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater\nexperience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel,\nattract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we\nmust identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.\nThe drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the\ndevelopment of pharmaceuticals that target the same conditions that we are targeting. Other companies have products or product candidates in various stages of\npre-clinical or clinical development, or with marketing approvals, to treat conditions for which we are also seeking to discover and develop product candidates.\nSome of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our product candidates and may be commercialized earlier.\nThe field of CAR T therapy is extremely active. Companies and partnerships currently engaged in clinical trials with CAR T modalities include Bristol Myers\nSquibb, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, Gilead Sciences, Galapagos NV, Autolus Therapeutics, 2seventy bio, Kyverna Therapeutics,\nCARGO Therapeutics, ImmPACT Bio, and Cabaletta Bio.\nThe gene therapy field is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We are aware\nof companies currently engaged in developing gene therapies in various indications, including Abeona Therapeutics, Adverum Biotechnologies, Astellas,\nAVROBIO, Sio Gene, Biogen, bluebird bio, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Krystal Biotech, MeiraGTx, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Orchard Therapeutics, Passage\nBio, Prevail Therapeutics, REGENXBIO, Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Roche, Sangamo Therapeutics, Sarepta Therapeutics, Solid Biosciences, Ultragenyx\nPharmaceuticals, uniQure and Voyager Therapeutics, as well as several companies addressing other methods for delivering or modifying genes and regulating\ngene expression.\n18\nTable of Contents\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 80 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining\nagreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Employees of Fortress also make valuable financial, legal, scientific and other strategic\ncontributions to our Company on a regular basis.\nSUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING\nAs an early-stage development company, we rely on our research partners to manufacture or have manufactured all LV vectors used in the clinical development\nprograms currently in progress at COH, Fred Hutch, St. Jude, the NIH, and LUMC under the IND applications filed by these institutions. In addition, we rely on\nthe NIH to produce oncolytic virus for UAB, the clinical trial site for the Phase 1 trial of Nationwide’s herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic virus (MB-108).\nWe will continue to rely on our research partners to manufacture lentiviral vectors and oncolytic virus for our IND trials until such time as material is available\nfrom our contract manufacturing organizations.\nPursuant to the March 2015 Licensing Agreement with COH, we have the right to make and have made the cellular products, and we have negotiated\nInvestigator-Initiated Clinical Research Support Agreements with COH and Fred Hutch which specify the cell processing costs and numbers of patients which\nwill be supplied under filed protocols. Our research partners have extensive experience manufacturing clinical materials for development studies, but we are\ncurrently dependent on both their capacity limitations and continued operating success to manufacture LV vector and to process cells for all CAR T clinical\ntrials for which these partners hold the INDs, as well as to have manufactured oncolytic virus for the MB-108 investigator-IND clinical trial being conducted at\nUAB.\nWe have limited experience in processing cells for clinical or commercial purposes. In 2018, we opened our own cell processing facility in Worcester,\nMassachusetts, in order to manufacture and supply cellular product candidates for all clinical trials that will be conducted under IND applications to be filed by\nus. In May 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with uBriGene (Boston) Biosciences, Inc., pursuant to which we agreed to sell our leasehold\ninterests in our cell processing facility and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies. On July 28, 2023, we\ncompleted the sale of all of our assets relating to our operations primarily relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies. See\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments.”\nIn May 2021, the FDA accepted our IND to initiate a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MB-106 (CD20) under our IND. In October 2023, the FDA\naccepted our IND application to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of MB-109. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be\nguaranteed, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.\nWe expect to rely on contract manufacturing relationships for LV vectors and for the MB-108 oncolytic virus, as well as for any non-CAR T products that we\nmay in-license or acquire in the future for co-administration with our CAR T products. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully\ncontract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContract manufacturers for these current and potential future non-CAR T products would be subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the\nFDA, and corresponding state agencies, to ensure strict compliance with the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“cGMP”) and other state and\nfederal regulations. Our contractors, if any, in Europe would face similar challenges from the numerous EU and member state regulatory agencies and\nauthorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual\nobligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and\nsupplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.\nIf we need to change manufacturers for these current and potential future non-CAR T products after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign\nregulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA\nregulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of\npotential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nGOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATIONS\nNumerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the\nclinical development, manufacture and, if approved, marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. None of\nour product candidates has been approved for sale in any market. Before marketing in the U.S.,\n19\nTable of Contents\nany drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA\nunder the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, adverse\nevent reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, and the sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.\nU.S. Drug Development\nThe regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting\ninformation to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a\nproduct in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-\nmarketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, preclinical\ndata, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence\na clinical trial. Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be\nconducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted\nFDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs\nFDA has various programs, including fast track designation, regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation, breakthrough therapy designation\n(BTD), accelerated approval, and priority review that are intended to expedite the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for\nthe treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address existing unmet medical needs. The purpose of these\nprograms is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.\nTo be eligible for fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening\ndisease or condition and based on preclinical or preliminary clinical data that demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need in the intended\npatient population. The FDA will determine that a product will fulfill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where either none exists or provide a\ntherapy that may be potentially superior to an existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors.\nA drug is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy which is defined as either a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineered product,\nhuman cell and tissue product, or a combination therapy using any such therapies or products , it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious\ncondition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the regenerative medicine therapy has the potential to address the unmet medical needs for such\nconditions. Advantages of RMAT designation include all the benefits of the fast track designation, including early interactions with FDA. The FDA must\nrespond to a request for RMAT designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. As with other expedited development programs, if RMAT\ndesignation has been granted but, later in development, the product no longer meets the qualifying criteria, then CBER may rescind the RMAT designation.\nMoreover, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended,\nalone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that\nthe drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects\nobserved early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the\ndevelopment and review of an application for approval, of a breakthrough therapy.\nThe FDA may give a priority review designation within 60 days of submission of a BLA or NDA to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a\ntreatment where no adequate therapy exists. If granted, a priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the\nstandard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Products that are eligible for fast track, RMAT or breakthrough therapy designation may be\neligible to receive a priority review if the criteria for priority review are met at the time of the BLA or NDA submission.\nIn addition, studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over\nexisting treatments may receive accelerated approval. Approval is determined on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials that establishing that\nthe drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than\nirreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into\naccount the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the\n20\nTable of Contents\navailability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform\npost-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint and under the Food and Drug\nOmnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific\ntime period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to\nwithdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit\nof the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely\nimpact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nEven if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for\nqualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated\napproval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.\nClinical Trials\nTo support a new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”) approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential\nphases:\n● Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, for the first time to test for safety, dosage\ntolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.\n● Phase 2: Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose\nrange, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.\n● Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.\n● Phase 4: The FDA may request phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test\nthe drug in different patient populations.\nThe length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying\ninterpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may\nincrease the costs of these trials, include:\n● slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in\nthe study or other factors;\n● inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study\nsite’s review board;\n● longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;\n● insufficient supply of the product candidates;\n● adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and\n● ineffectiveness of the product candidates.\nIn addition, the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a clinical trial may place a clinical trial on hold or\nterminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or\nundesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable\ntoxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a product\ncandidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of product candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or\nregulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our product candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or\nforeign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.\n21\nTable of Contents\nSponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA for studies intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. The\nSPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to\nform the basis for an NDA or BLA. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the\nbenefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the pivotal clinical trial. Once approved, the SPA may only be changed through a written agreement between the\nsponsor and the FDA, or in rare cases if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy the SPA can be rescinded.\nThe FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, formerly called the Office of Therapeutic Proteins, which is a super office within the\nCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of cell and gene therapies and related products. and has established the\nCellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER in its review, if requested by FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of\nan Advisory Committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. There are a number of additional requirements that apply exclusively to clinical\ntrials involving this class of products. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA\nwill consider at each of the above stages of development. These guidelines relate to, among other things: preclinical evaluation of gene therapies, design of\nclinical studies, and the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an initial IND application and throughout clinical\ndevelopment to support a NDA or BLA application. Measures to observe for delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene\ntherapies are required. Per the guidelines, FDA requires that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events which can be,\ndependent upon various factors, up to a period of 15 years post treatment.\nFDA Review and Approval\nBefore receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an\nNDA or BLA containing the preclinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications\nand information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA or BLA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and,\neven after accepting an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, before approval for marketing a product.\nAlthough uncommon, the FDA may request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA or BLA approval for products with serious\nsafety concerns to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. The REMS plan may contain post-marketing obligations of the sponsor to\ntrain prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and perhaps the conduct of Phase 4 follow-up studies and/or patient registries to ensure the continued\nsafe use of the drug.\nAs part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a\nmanufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure\ncontinued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or for us to comply with the\napplicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may\nnot allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.\nIf the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated\nthrough clinical studies and as reflected in the approved labeling. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications\napproved in the NDA or BLA. Certain changes to an approved NDA or BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, may\nrequire prior approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to\nFDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences\nwith the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to\nthose specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs\nwhose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-\nsubmitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in the approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory\nrequirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement\nactions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency\nenforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,\nfederal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.\n22\nTable of Contents\nPost-Marketing Requirements\nFollowing approval, we and the new product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, which include monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting\nof adverse experiences and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include prohibitions on the promotion of the drugs for unapproved,\nor “off-label” uses. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label treatments, manufacturers may not promote such non-FDA approved\nuses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use and an on-going basis. Further, if there are any\nmodifications to the drug, including changes to indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and\nobtain FDA approval of a supplemental NDA/BLA or new NDA/BLA, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional\npreclinical studies or clinical trials.\nThe FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices\n(“CGMPs”). These regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the\nobligation to investigate and correct any deviations from CGMPs. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of\napproved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic, inspections by the FDA and\ncertain state agencies for compliance with CGMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of\nproduction and quality control to maintain compliance with CGMPs. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to CGMPs, could result\nin enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an\napproved NDA/BLA, including voluntary recalls and product seizures.\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences,\nincluding adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, untitled or warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrections to advertising or\ncommunications to doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a\nproduct’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management\nmeasures. New government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could\ndelay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.\nPediatric Information\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA may need to contain data to assess the safety and\nefficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric\nsubpopulation in which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may however grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Non-\noncology drugs are exempt from PREA if they were granted an orphan drug designation.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit an NDA or BLA , or a\nsupplement to an approved NDA or BLA, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration\nsubmit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“iPSP”), within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the\ninitiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 trial. In the event a Phase 3 study is not planned the iPSP must be submitted no later than 210 calendar days before the\nplaned NDA of BLA submission, Oncology products intended to treat adult cancers is also required to submit an iPSP including those products which were\ngranted an orphan drug designation. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric trial(s) that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives\nand design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such information and any request for a deferral of\npediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric trials. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on\nthe PSP, but the sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data\ncollected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and other clinical development programs. A sponsor should not submit an NDA or BLA until the\nFDA confirms agreement on the iPSP.\nIn the EU, a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained through studies in children, to\nsupport the authorization of a medicine for children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as\ndescribed in an agreed upon PIP, unless there is a deferral or waiver.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nThe FDA may grant orphan drug designation (“ODD”) to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the\nU.S., or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the drug for this type\nof disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, the European Commission, after receiving the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for\nOrphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”), grants orphan medicinal product designation in respect of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or\ntreatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU. In addition, designation may be\ngranted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when,\nwithout incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological\nproduct. In each case, there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the applicable condition authorized for marketing in the EU,\nor, if such a method exists, the sponsor must establish that its product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.\nIn the U.S., orphan drug status, which is granted following the approval of the NDA or BLA, entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for\ngrant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for\nwhich it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the\nsame drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with\norphan exclusivity.\nIn the EU, orphan medicinal product designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market\nexclusivity is granted following drug or biological product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that\nthe orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market\nexclusivity.\nOrphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application (NDA/BLA) for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey\nany advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.\nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\nManufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product candidate approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in\naddition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.\nWe will also be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our\nproposed sales, marketing and educational programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states\nin which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n· The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either (1) the referral of an individual to a person for\nfurnishing any item or service for which payment is available under a federal health care program, or (2) the purchase, lease, order or recommendation\nthereof of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is available under a federal health care program;\n· The False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or\ncausing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government or making or using, or causing to be made or used, a false\nrecord or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n· The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing\na scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, obtaining money or property of the health care benefit program through false representations or\nknowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making false statements or using or making any false or fraudulent\ndocument in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits or services;\n24\nTable of Contents\n· HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations,\nwhich imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n· The provision under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered\ndrugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to track and annually report to CMS payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and\nteaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members in applicable manufacturers\nand group purchasing organizations; applicable manufacturers are also required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value\nprovided, as well as ownership and investment interests held, to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse\nanesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives;\n· The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either\ndirectly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also\nrequires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe\npharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA; and\n· State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and state laws concerning security\nand privacy of health care information, which may differ in substance and application from state-to-state thereby complicating compliance efforts.\nPharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement\nIn the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the\navailability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers\nand other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in\naddition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate\nthird-party reimbursement may not be available for any product for which we obtain regulatory approval to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our\ninvestment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including\nregulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable\nCare Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInternational Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product\ncandidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock or any other type of equity or debt securities we may offer (together, our “Securities”) involves a high degree of risk. The\nfollowing information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have\nmade in this Form 10-K and those we may make from time to time. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information\ncontained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any\nof these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or other factors not\nperceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations. Some of the statements in the following risk\nfactors constitute forward-looking statements. Please see the section titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”\n25\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the\nforeseeable future, if ever.\nWe have a limited operating history. We have focused primarily on organizing, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and identifying\nand obtaining preclinical data or clinical data for various product candidates, with the goal of supporting regulatory approval for these product candidates. We\nhave incurred losses since our inception in March 2015. Our net losses were $51.6 million and $77.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $381.0 million as of December 31, 2023. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses\nfor the foreseeable future. We also do not anticipate that we will achieve profitability for a period of time after generating material revenues, if ever. If we are\nunable to generate revenues, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased\nexpenses or when or if we will be able to achieve profitability. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate\nthat our expenses will increase substantially if:\n● one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval and are approved for commercial sale, due to our need to establish the necessary\ncommercial infrastructure to launch and commercialize this product candidate without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing\npersonnel and contracting with third parties for manufacturing, testing, warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;\n● we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;\n● there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;\n● we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements that require us to make payments to collaborators or licensors;\n● there are variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;\n● there are any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits in which we may become involved; and\n● there are any regulatory developments affecting product candidates of our competitors.\nOur ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our development stage\nproducts, and we do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenue. Our ability to generate revenue depends on a number of factors, including, but not\nlimited to, our ability to:\n● obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, or any future product candidate that we may license or acquire;\n● manufacture or have manufactured commercial quantities of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, at\nacceptable cost levels; and\n● develop a commercial organization and the supporting infrastructure required to successfully market and sell one or more of our product candidates or\nany future product candidate, if approved.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain\nprofitable would depress the value of our Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development\nefforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations. A decline in the value of our Company could also cause you to lose all or part of your\ninvestment in our Securities.\nThere is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional funding, (which may not be available on\nacceptable terms to us, or at all) and/or delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe are currently advancing our programs in hematologic cancers, solid tumors and rare genetic diseases through clinical development. Developing and\ncommercializing CAR T and gene therapy products is expensive, and we do not expect to generate meaningful product\n26\nTable of Contents\nrevenues in the foreseeable future until we obtain marketing approval for products in the United States and following any potential commercial launch.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents were $6.2 million. Based on our current business plan, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability\nto continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are issued. Our\nfundraising efforts to raise additional funding may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop\nand commercialize our potential products following marketing approval if and when obtained. In addition, we cannot guarantee that financing will be available\nin sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our\nstockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares\nto decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. Potential indebtedness, if incurred, would result in\nincreased fixed payment obligations, and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt,\nlimitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct\nour business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be\ndesirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of\nwhich may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nIn addition, in order to address our current funding constraints, we may be required to further revise our business plan and strategy, which may result in us (i)\nfurther curtailing, delaying or discontinuing one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product candidates, (ii)\nselling certain of our assets and/or (iii) may result in our being unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities. Such\nactions may become necessary whether or not we are able to raise additional capital. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be materially affected.\nOur short operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe have been conducting operations only since our incorporation in March 2015. Our operations to date have been limited. We have not yet demonstrated an\nability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a clinical scale or commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party\nto do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions about our\nfuture performance may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, as a young business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. We will\nneed to expand our capabilities to support commercial activities. We may not be successful in adding such capabilities.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors,\nmany of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any past quarterly period as an indication of future operating\nperformance.\nWe will require substantial additional funding which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise the necessary additional\ncapital, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or continue our development programs.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We will need to significantly increase our spending to advance the preclinical and\nclinical development of our product candidates and launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval, including\nbuilding our own commercial organizations to address certain markets. We will require substantial additional capital for the further development and, if\napproved, commercialization of our product candidates, as well as to fund our other operating expenses and capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad $7.0 million in cash and restricted cash and have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able\nto raise funds to complete the development of our product candidates. Additionally, if we are unable to secure additional funding, it is likely that we will need to\ndelay or terminate the development of certain product candidates; any such delay or termination, or the announcement of any such delay or termination, may\nimpact our potential growth and have a material adverse effect on the value of our Securities.\nIn order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing and may choose to raise additional\nfunds through strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements, public or private equity or debt financing, bank lines of credit, asset sales, government grants, or\nother arrangements. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable\n27\nTable of Contents\nterms, or at all. Additional funding may be more difficult to obtain, or may be more expensive, as a result of recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the\nU.S. economy generally. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale\nback or discontinue the development or, if approved, commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. We may also seek collaborators for one or\nmore of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be\navailable. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n● the scope, timing, design and conduct of, and results from, preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n● the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates, and any costs associated with such delays;\n● the costs of establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute our product candidates;\n● the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application\n(“BLA”) for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical\ntrials to support applications for regulatory approval;\n● the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates,\nincluding any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;\n● the cost and timing of securing sufficient supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturers for clinical trials and in preparation for\ncommercialization;\n● the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n● the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish;\n● if one or more of our product candidates are approved, the potential that we may be required to file a lawsuit to defend our patent rights or regulatory\nexclusivities from challenges by companies seeking to market generic versions of one or more of our product candidates;\n● the success of the commercialization of one or more of our product candidates, if approved;\n● the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and\ndefending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n● macroeconomic factors such as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, liquidity constraints, failures and instability in U.S. and international\nfinancial banking systems, supply disruptions due to political unrest, conflict and war or other factors, and pandemics.\nUnder current SEC regulations, if at the time we file our Annual Report on Form 10-K our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our public\nfloat remains less than $75 million, the amount we can raise through primary public offerings of securities in any twelve-month period using shelf registration\nstatements is limited to an aggregate of one-third of our public float, which is referred to as the “baby shelf rules.” SEC regulations permit us to use the highest\nclosing sales price of our common stock (or the average of the last bid and last ask prices of our common stock) on any day within 60 days of sales under the\nregistration statement to calculate our public float.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, for sales following the date of this Form 10-K, and until we again have\na public float with a value in exceeds of $75 million, if ever, we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our public float under shelf registration\nstatements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the amount of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration statements will\nalso decrease.\nOur inability to raise capital when needed would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, and could cause our stock value to decline or\nrequire that we wind down our operations altogether.\n28\nTable of Contents\nRaising additional capital, including through lending arrangements, may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to\nrelinquish proprietary rights.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt\nfinancings, grants and license and development agreements in connection with any collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale\nof equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences\nthat adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, including through lending arrangements, and preferred equity financing, if available, may\ninvolve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital\nexpenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to\nrelinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be\nfavorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or\nterminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer\nto develop and market ourselves.\nWe will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote\nsubstantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), as well as\nrules subsequently implemented by the SEC, and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. These rules impose various requirements on public companies,\nincluding requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and appropriate corporate governance practices. Our\nmanagement and other personnel have devoted and will continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these\nrules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and\nregulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy\nlimits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain\nqualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as executive officers.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and\nprocedures. As a result, we are required to periodically perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on\nthe effectiveness of those controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These efforts to comply with Section 404 and related regulations have\nrequired, and continue to require, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. While we anticipate maintaining the integrity of our\ninternal controls over financial reporting and all other aspects of Section 404, we cannot be certain that a material weakness will not be identified when we test\nthe effectiveness of our control systems in the future. If a material weakness is identified, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other\nregulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, costly litigation or a loss of public confidence in our internal\ncontrols, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nWe are a \"smaller reporting company,\" and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock\nless attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, and we will remain a smaller reporting company until the fiscal year following the determination that our voting and non-\nvoting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenues\nare more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common shares held by non-affiliates is more than\n$700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. Smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation\ndisclosure, are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404, and have certain other reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other\nthings, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements and not being required to provide selected financial data, supplemental financial\ninformation or risk factors.\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced reporting obligations available to us. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common\nstock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market\nfor our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile.\n29\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nWe may, from time to time, carry net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage- point\ncumulative change (by value) in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period), the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change\nNOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future\nas a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which changes are outside our control. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and other pre-\nchange tax attributes to offset post-change taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitation.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy, Structure, and Organization\nWe currently have no products for sale. We are heavily dependent on the success of our product candidates, and we cannot give any assurances that any of\nour product candidates will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nTo date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our product candidates. We have not\ndemonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful acquisition, development or commercialization of the technologies we are seeking\nto develop. As an early stage company, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and\nuncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Our future success is\nsubstantially dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then commercialize such product candidates. Most of our\nproduct candidates are currently in early stage clinical trials. Our business depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of our product\ncandidates, which may never occur. We currently have no drug products for sale, currently generate no revenues from sales of any drug products, and may never\nbe able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.\nThe successful development, and any commercialization, of our technologies and any product candidates that may occur would require us to successfully\nperform a variety of functions, including:\n● developing our technology platform;\n● identifying, developing, formulating, manufacturing and, if approved, commercializing product candidates;\n● entering into successful licensing and other arrangements with product development partners;\n● participating in regulatory approval processes, including ultimately gaining approval to market a drug product, which may not occur;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates from our third-party manufacturers to meet clinical trial needs and, if approved, to meet\ncommercial demand at launch and thereafter;\n● establishing and maintaining agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;\n● conducting sales and marketing activities including hiring, training, deploying and supporting our sales force and creating market demand for our\nproduct candidates through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote our product candidates that we may\nestablish;\n● maintaining patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and\n● raising additional required capital on acceptable terms.\nOur operations have historically been limited to organizing, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and identifying and obtaining\npreclinical data or clinical data for various product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis to assess our ability to continue to develop our\ntechnology, identify product candidates, develop and commercialize any product candidates we are able to identify and enter into successful collaborative\narrangements with other companies, as well as for you to assess the advisability of investing in our securities. Each of these requirements will require\nsubstantial time, effort and financial resources.\n30\nTable of Contents\nEach of our product candidates will require additional clinical development, management of clinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in the\njurisdictions in which we plan to market the product, obtaining manufacturing supply, building a commercial organization, and significant marketing efforts\nbefore we generate any revenues from product sales, which may not occur. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates in the U.S.\nor any other jurisdiction before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, respectively, and we may never\nreceive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nOur approach to the development of our product candidates is unproven, and we do not know whether we will be able to develop any products of\ncommercial value.\nOur product candidates are emerging technologies and, consequently, it is conceivable that such technologies may ultimately fail to develop into commercially\nviable therapies to treat human patients with cancer or other diseases. One of the reasons for the lack of commercial viability could be our inability to obtain\nregulatory approval for such technologies.\nCAR T is a new approach to cancer treatment that presents significant challenges.\nWe have concentrated much of our research and development efforts on CAR T technology, and our future success is highly dependent on the successful\ndevelopment of T cell immunotherapies in general and our CAR T technology and product candidates in particular. Because CAR T is a relatively new approach\nto cancer immunotherapy and cancer treatment generally, developing and commercializing our product candidates subjects us to a number of challenges,\nincluding, but not necessarily limited to:\n● obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities that may have very limited experience with the commercial development\nof genetically modified T cell therapies for cancer;\n● developing and deploying consistent and reliable processes for engineering a patient’s T cells ex vivo and infusing the engineered T cells back into the\npatient;\n● conditioning patients with chemotherapy in conjunction with delivering each of our products, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects of\nour product candidates;\n● educating medical personnel regarding the potential side effect profile of each of our product candidates;\n● developing processes for the safe administration of these product candidates, including long-term follow-up for all patients who receive our product\ncandidates;\n● sourcing clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our product candidates;\n● developing a manufacturing process and distribution network with a cost of goods that allows for an attractive return on investment;\n● establishing sales and marketing capabilities after obtaining any regulatory approval to gain market acceptance, and obtaining adequate coverage,\nreimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities; and\n● developing therapies for types of cancers beyond those addressed by our current product candidates.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that\nmay be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As\na result, we may forego or delay the pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial\npotential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on\ncurrent and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do\nnot accurately and/or effectively evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that\nproduct candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole\ndevelopment and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\n31\nTable of Contents\nRisks Inherent in Drug Development and Commercialization\nDelays in the commencement or conduct of our clinical trials could result in increased costs and delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval.\nClinical trials are expensive and can take many years to complete, and the outcome is inherently uncertain. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials\nwill be conducted as planned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage and our future\nclinical trials may not be successful. The commencement or conduct of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not necessarily\nlimited to, delays in:\n● commencing a clinical trial as a result of regulatory authority action;\n● identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n● reaching and preserving agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (“CROs”) and trial sites, the terms of which\ncan be subject to extensive negotiation, may be subject to modification from time to time and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial\nsites;\n● obtaining sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n● obtaining Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site;\n● developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis, if required;\n● adding new clinical sites once a trial has begun;\n● change in the principal investigator or other key staff overseeing the clinical trial at a given site;\n● identifying, recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical trial; or\n● retaining (or replacing) patients who have initiated a clinical trial but who may withdraw due to adverse events from the therapy, insufficient efficacy,\nfatigue with the clinical trial process, personal issues, or other reasons.\nAny delays in the commencement of our clinical trials will delay our ability to pursue regulatory approval for product candidates. In addition, many of the\nfactors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nSuspensions or delays in the completion of clinical testing could result in increased costs and delay or prevent our ability to complete development of that\nproduct candidate or generate product revenues, if approved.\nOnce a clinical trial has begun, patient recruitment and enrollment may be slower than we anticipate due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of\npatients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors. Clinical trials may also be delayed as a result of ambiguous or\nnegative interim results or difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of product manufactured in accordance with regulatory requirements and on a timely\nbasis. Further, a clinical trial may be modified, suspended or terminated by us, an IRB, an ethics committee or a data safety monitoring committee overseeing\nthe clinical trial, any clinical trial site with respect to that site, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, due to a number of factors, including, but not\nnecessarily limited to:\n● failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;\n● inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold;\n● stopping rules contained in the protocol;\n● unforeseen safety issues or any determination that the clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks; and\n● lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\n32\nTable of Contents\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance also may occur, and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may\nrequire us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may in turn impact the costs and timing of, and the likelihood of successfully\ncompleting, a clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we must suspend or terminate, any clinical trial of any product candidate, our\nability to obtain regulatory approval for that product candidate will be delayed, and the commercial prospects, if any, for the product candidate may suffer as a\nresult. In addition, many of these factors may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nProduct candidates that we advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nPharmaceutical development has inherent risks. We will be required to demonstrate through well-controlled clinical trials that product candidates are effective\nwith a favorable benefit-risk profile for use in their target indications before seeking regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Success in early clinical\ntrials does not mean that later clinical trials will be successful, as product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety or\nefficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. Also, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials that are not currently anticipated.\nCompanies frequently suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after earlier clinical trials have shown promising results. As a result, product\ncandidates that we advance into clinical trials may not receive regulatory approval.\nIn addition, even if our product candidates were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidates or any future product\ncandidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent\non the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary\nor desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. The regulatory authority may also require the label to contain warnings,\ncontraindications, or precautions that limit the commercialization of the product. Any of these scenarios could impact the commercial prospects for one or more\nof our current or future product candidates.\nAny product candidates we advance into clinical development are subject to extensive regulation, which can be costly and time consuming, cause\nunanticipated delays or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize product candidates.\nThe research and clinical development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and\ndistribution of any product candidate, including our product candidates, is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable\nhealth authorities in foreign markets. In the United States, we are not permitted to market a product candidate until such product candidate’s BLA or NDA is\napproved by the FDA. The process of obtaining approval is uncertain, expensive, often spanning many years, and can vary substantially based upon the type,\ncomplexity and novelty of the products involved. In addition to significant and expensive clinical testing requirements, our ability to obtain marketing approval\nfor product candidates depends on obtaining the final results of required non-clinical testing, including characterization of the manufactured components of our\nproduct candidates and validation of our manufacturing processes. The FDA may determine that our product manufacturing processes, testing procedures or\nequipment and facilities are inadequate to support approval. Approval policies or regulations may change, and the FDA has substantial discretion in the\npharmaceutical approval process, including the ability to delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons. Despite the time and expense\ninvested in the clinical development of product candidates, regulatory approval is never guaranteed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including, but not limited to:\n● the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the trial design or implementation of our clinical trials, including proper use\nof clinical trial methods and methods of data analysis;\n● an inability to establish sufficient data and information to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for\nan indication;\n● the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials conducted by individual investigators or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different\nfrom that of the United States;\n● the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA for approval;\n● the FDA may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n33\nTable of Contents\n● the FDA may determine that our manufacturing processes or facilities or those of third-party manufacturers with which we or our respective\ncollaborators currently contract for clinical supplies and plan to contract for commercial supplies do not satisfactorily comply with cGMPs; or\n● the approval policies or interpretation of regulations of the FDA may significantly change in a manner rendering the clinical data insufficient for\napproval or the product characteristics or benefit-risk profile unfavorable for approval.\nWith respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product testing,\nadministrative review periods and agreements with pricing authorities. In addition, rapid drug and biological development during the COVID-19 pandemic has\nraised questions about the safety and efficacy of certain marketed pharmaceuticals and may result in increased cautiousness by the FDA and comparable foreign\nregulatory authorities in reviewing new pharmaceuticals based on safety, efficacy or other regulatory considerations and may result in significant delays in\nobtaining regulatory approvals. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing our\nproduct candidates.\nRegulatory approval for our product candidates by the FDA, or any similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, is limited to those specific\nindications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to the indications for use and related treatment of those specific diseases and indications set forth in the approval for which a\nproduct is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA, or other similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. In addition to the regulatory approval\nrequired for new drug products, new formulations or indications for an approved product also require regulatory approval. If we are not able to obtain regulatory\napproval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be\nadversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical\nstudies and approved by the regulatory authorities (“off-label uses”), our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically\napproved by the FDA, or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute\nan appropriate treatment for some patients in certain circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate practice of medicine or the\nbehavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the\npromotion of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to compliance or enforcement\nactions, including Warning Letters, by these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA laws, regulations and guidelines relating to promotion and\nadvertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, request a recall or institute fines or penalties, or could result in\ndisgorgement of money, operating restrictions, corrective advertising, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and we or our contract manufacturer(s) fail to produce the product, or components of the product, in the\nvolumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays\nin the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, or be unable to meet market demand, and may lose potential revenues.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing\ntechniques and process controls, and the use of specialized processing equipment. We may enter into development and supply agreements with contract\nmanufacturers for the completion of pre-commercialization manufacturing development activities and, if approved, the manufacture of commercial supplies for\none or more of our product candidates. Any termination or disruption of our relationships with our contract manufacturers may materially harm our business and\nfinancial condition and frustrate any commercialization efforts for each respective product candidate.\nAll of our contract manufacturers must comply with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations, including cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA\nthrough its establishment inspection program. We are required by law to establish adequate oversight and control over raw materials, components and finished\nproducts furnished by our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers, but we have little control over their compliance with these regulations. Any failure\nto comply with applicable regulations may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, restrictions on imports and exports, suspension or delay\nin product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval, and would limit the availability of our product and customer confidence in our\nproduct. Any manufacturing defect or error discovered after products have been produced and distributed could result in even more significant consequences,\nincluding costly recalls, re-stocking costs, damage to our reputation and potential for product liability claims.\n34\nTable of Contents\nIf the contract manufacturers upon whom we may rely to manufacture one or more of our product candidates, and any future product candidate we may in-\nlicense, fails to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis at commercially reasonable prices, we would likely be unable to meet demand for\nour approved product and we would lose potential revenues.\nIf serious adverse or unacceptable side effects are identified during the development of one or more of our product candidates or any future product\ncandidate, we may need to abandon or limit the development of some of our product candidates.\nIf one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate are associated with undesirable side effects or adverse events in clinical trials or have\ncharacteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the\nadverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. In our industry,\nmany compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing have later been found to cause serious adverse events that prevented further development\nof the compound. In the event that our clinical trials reveal a high or unacceptable severity and prevalence of adverse events, our trials could be suspended or\nterminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development or deny approval of one or more of our\nproduct candidates or any future product candidate for any or all targeted indications. The FDA could also issue a letter requesting additional data or\ninformation prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve a product candidate. The number of requests for additional data or information\nissued by the FDA in recent years has increased and has resulted in substantial delays in the approval of several new drugs. Adverse events or undesirable side\neffects caused by one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate could also result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our\nproduct labeling or in denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, which would, in turn, prevent\nus from commercializing and generating market acceptance and revenues from the sale of that product candidate. Adverse events or side effects could affect\npatient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable\nside effects caused by this product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n● regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, including specific warnings , black box warnings, adverse reactions,\nprecautions, and/or contraindications;\n● regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, and/or require it to be removed from the market;\n● we may be required to recall a product, be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the\nlabeling of the product; or\n● our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any of our product candidates or any future product candidate or\ncould substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues, or any\nrevenues, from their sale.\nEven if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval, it and any other products we may market will remain subject to substantial\nregulatory scrutiny.\nIf one or more of our product candidates that we may license or acquire is approved, the approved product candidate will be subject to ongoing requirements\nand review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and\nsubmission of safety and other post-market information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality\ncontrol, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and\nrecordkeeping of the drug, and requirements regarding our presentations to and interactions with health care professionals.\nThe FDA, or other regulatory authorities, may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety\nor efficacy of the product. The FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure\ndrugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other applicable regulatory\nauthorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market any approved product for only their\napproved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (“FDCA”)\nrelating to the promotion of prescription\n35\nTable of Contents\ndrugs may lead to investigations, civil claims, and/or criminal charges alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state\nconsumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to\ncomply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:\n● restrictions on such products, operations, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n● restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n● restrictions on product distribution or use;\n● requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n● warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, import alerts, and/or inspection observations;\n● withdrawal of the products from the market;\n● refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n● recall of products;\n● fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits;\n● suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;\n● suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n● refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n● product seizure; or\n● injunctions, consent decrees, and/or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA’s policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product\ncandidates, or negatively affect those products for which we may have already received regulatory approval, if any. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes\nin existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to the\nvarious actions listed above, including losing any marketing approval that we may have obtained.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact\nour business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until we have completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory review process,\nincluding approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we\nhave secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation\nof the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if it believes the name inappropriately implies\nmedical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product\ncandidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be\nrequired to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not\ninfringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely\nmanner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPublic concern regarding the safety of drug products could delay or limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval, result in the inclusion of unfavorable\ninformation in our labeling, or require us to undertake other activities that may entail additional costs.\nIn light of widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of the U.S. Congress, the Government\nAccountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the\nwithdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the establishment of risk management programs. The\nFood and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, (“FDAAA”), grants significant expanded authority to the FDA, much of which is aimed at improving\nthe safety of drug products before and after approval. In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and\nclinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs,\nincluding certain currently approved drugs. It also significantly expands the federal government’s clinical trial registry and results databank, which we expect\nwill result in significantly increased government oversight of clinical trials. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new\nlaw are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties, among other regulatory, civil and criminal penalties. The increased attention to drug safety issues may\nresult in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny, particularly\nwith respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA\nrequires us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials prior to approving any of our product candidates, our ability to obtain approval of this\nproduct candidate will be delayed. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical data following the approval of any of our product\ncandidates, the indications for which this product candidate is approved may be limited or there may be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and our\nefforts to commercialize our product candidates may be otherwise adversely impacted.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or\nprevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of\neligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Some of our competitors have\nongoing clinical trials for product candidates that treat the same indications that we are targeting for our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise\nbe eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors’ product candidates. Available therapies for the indications we are\npursuing can also affect enrollment in our clinical trials. Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the severity of the disease under investigation;\n● the eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n● the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n● the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n● the patient referral practices of physicians;\n● the number of clinical trials sponsored by other companies for the same patient population;\n● the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n● the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more\nclinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates or future product\ncandidates, which would cause the value of our Company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\n37\nTable of Contents\nIf our competitors develop treatments for any of our product candidates’ target indications and those competitor products are approved more quickly,\nmarketed more successfully or demonstrated to be more effective, the commercial opportunity for our product candidate will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the\ndevelopment and, if approved, marketing of our product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology\nand pharmaceutical companies. There can be no assurance that developments by others will not render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or\nnoncompetitive. Furthermore, new developments, including the development of other drug technologies and methods of preventing the incidence of disease,\noccur in the pharmaceutical industry at a rapid pace. These developments may render one or more of our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive.\nCompetitors may seek to develop alternative formulations that do not directly infringe on our in-licensed patent rights. The commercial opportunity for one or\nmore of our product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop alternative formulations outside the scope of our in-licensed\npatents. Compared to us, many of our potential competitors have substantially greater:\n● capital resources;\n● development resources, including personnel and technology;\n● clinical trial experience;\n● regulatory experience;\n● expertise in prosecution of intellectual property rights; and\n● manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing experience.\nAs a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we are able to or may obtain patent protection or\nother intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop\ndrugs that are more effective, safe, useful and less costly than ours and may be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Smaller\nor early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nWe will also face competition from these third parties in establishing clinical trial sites, in patient registration for clinical trials, and in identifying and in-\nlicensing new product candidates.\nFurther, generic therapies are typically sold at lower prices than branded therapies and are generally preferred by hospital formularies and managed care\nproviders of health services. We anticipate that, if approved, our product candidates will face increasing competition in the form of generic versions of branded\nproducts of competitors, including those that have lost or will lose their patent exclusivity. In the future, we may face additional competition from a generic\nform of our own candidates when the patents covering them begin to expire, or earlier if the patents are successfully challenged. If we are unable to demonstrate\nto physicians and payers that the key differentiating features of our product candidates translate to overall clinical benefit or lower cost of care, we may not be\nable to compete with generic alternatives.\nIf any of our product candidates are successfully developed but, if approved, do not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients,\nhealthcare payors and the medical community, the revenues that any such product candidates generate from sales will be limited.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and the medical\ncommunity. Coverage and reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, generally would also be necessary for\ncommercial success. The degree of market acceptance of any approved products would depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:\n● the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n● the timing of market introduction of such approved product as well as competitive products;\n● the clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n● acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n38\nTable of Contents\n● the safety of such product candidates seen in a broader patient group, (i.e., based on actual use);\n● the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;\n● the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n● changes in regulatory requirements by government authorities for our product candidates;\n● the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product candidate for clinical practices;\n● the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug\ninteractions, or other precautions;\n● changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing\nimpact of any labeling or marketing claims that we could make following FDA approval;\n● the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for a companion diagnostic, if any;\n● the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n● the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is not perceived as being as beneficial as, the current\nstandard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory\nauthorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-\neffectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. If any\nproduct candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate\nrevenues from that product would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of\nour product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful.\nReimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our\nproducts profitably.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Such third-party payors include government\nhealth programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We intend to seek approval to market our product\ncandidates in the U.S., the EU and other selected foreign jurisdictions. Market acceptance and sales of our product candidates in both domestic and international\nmarkets will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for any of our product candidates and\nmay be affected by existing and future health care reform measures. Government and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare\ncosts by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product\ncandidates, if approved. These payors may conclude that our product candidates are less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing or future\nintroduced products, and third-party payors may not approve our product candidates, if approved, for coverage and reimbursement or may cease providing\ncoverage and reimbursement for these product candidates.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could\nrequire us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. We may not be able to provide data\nsufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount,\nor if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly in the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing\nnegotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product candidate. To obtain reimbursement\nor pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to\nother available therapies. If reimbursement of our product candidates, if approved, is unavailable or limited in scope or amount in a particular country, or if\npricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability of our products in such a country.\n39\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product\ncandidates, we may be unsuccessful in commercializing our product candidates, if they are approved.\nWe currently do not have a marketing or sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize any\napproved product candidate, we would need to build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or arrange for third parties to\nperform these services, and we may be unsuccessful in doing so. In the event of successful development and regulatory approval of any of our current or future\nproduct candidates, we expect to build a targeted specialist sales force to market or co-promote the product. There are risks involved with establishing our own\nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product\nlaunch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for\nany reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we\ncannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, on our own include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n● the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;\n● the lack of complementary or other products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage from the perspective of\nsales efficiency relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n● unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating our own sales and marketing organization.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for one or more of our\nproduct candidates or a future product candidate we may license or acquire and, if approved, may have to limit their commercialization.\nThe use of one or more of our product candidates and any future product candidate we may license or acquire in clinical trials and the sale of any products for\nwhich we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. For example, we may be sued if any product candidate we develop\nallegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, and, if approved, during marketing or sale. Any such\nproduct liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence,\nstrict liability or a breach of warranties. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others using, administering\nor selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual\noutcome, liability claims may result in:\n● withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n● suspension or termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n● decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n● initiation of investigations by regulators;\n● impairment of our business reputation;\n● costs of related litigation;\n● substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n● loss of revenues;\n● reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n40\nTable of Contents\n● the inability to commercialize our product candidate or future product candidates, if approved.\nWe will obtain limited product liability insurance coverage for any and all of our upcoming clinical trials. However, our insurance coverage may not reimburse\nus or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and, in\nthe future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. When\nneeded we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product\ncandidates in development, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. On\noccasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or\nseries of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely\naffect our business.\nProduct candidates, even if successfully developed and commercialized, may be effective only in combating certain specific types of cancer, and the market\nfor drugs designed to combat such cancer type(s) may be small and unprofitable.\nThere are many different types of cancer, and a treatment that is effective against one type of cancer may not be effective against another. CAR T or other\ntechnologies we pursue may only be effective in combating specific types of cancer but not others. Even if one or more of our product candidates, if approved,\nproves to be an effective treatment against a given type of cancer, the number of patients suffering from such cancer may be small, in which case potential sales\nfrom a therapy designed to combat such cancer would be limited.\nOur gene therapy product candidates are based on a novel technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate\ndevelopment and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.\nWe have concentrated a portion of our therapeutic product research and development efforts on our gene therapy platform, and our future success depends, in\npart, on the successful development of this therapeutic approach. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related\nto our gene therapy platform will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience\ndelays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may\nprevent us from completing our clinical studies or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nIn addition, the clinical study requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these\nregulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and\nmarket of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for\nother, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, a limited number of gene therapy products, including\nCAR T therapies, have been approved by the FDA, the EMA and the European Commission. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is\ndifficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in the United States, the EU or\nother jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval.\nRegulatory requirements governing the development of gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. The FDA has\nestablished the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene\ntherapy and related products, and to advise the CBER on its review. The FDA can put an IND on clinical hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to\nassess the risks in pediatric patients. Before a clinical study can begin at any institution, that institution’s IRB and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will\nhave to review the proposed clinical study to assess the safety of the study. Moreover, serious adverse events or developments in clinical trials of gene therapy\nproduct candidates conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to initiate a clinical hold on our clinical trials or otherwise change the\nrequirements for approval of any of our product candidates.\nThese regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory\nreview process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations,\ndelay or prevent approval and, if approved, commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or\nrestrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable\nrequirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain,\nor unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient\nproduct revenue to maintain our business.\n41\nTable of Contents\nNegative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of the therapies that underpin many of our product candidates may damage public perception of\nour product candidates or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nPublic perception may be influenced by claims that one or more of the therapies underpinning our product candidates, including without limitation gene therapy,\nis unsafe, and such therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, the success of our gene therapy platforms will\ndepend upon physicians specializing in the treatment of those diseases that our product candidates target prescribing treatments that involve the use of our\nproduct candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available.\nMore restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair\nthe development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. Adverse events in our clinical trials, even if not\nultimately attributable to our product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could lead to increased governmental regulation, unfavorable public perception,\npotential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that do\nobtain approval and/or a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. Concern about environmental spread of our products, whether real or anticipated,\nmay also hinder the commercialization of our products.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform\nsatisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials or complying with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe rely on our licensors to conduct some of our preclinical studies and some of our clinical trials for our product candidates and for future product candidates,\nand we rely on third-party CROs and site management organizations to conduct most of the remainder of our preclinical studies and all the rest of our clinical\ntrials. We expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as our licensors, CROs, site management organizations, clinical data management organizations,\nmedical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct some of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials. The agreements with these third parties\nmight terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, that could delay\nour product development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities.\nFor example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general\ninvestigational plan and protocols for the trial and for ensuring that our preclinical studies are conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices (“GLPs”)\nas appropriate. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCPs”) for conducting, recording\nand reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial\nparticipants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites.\nIf we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or\ncomparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure\nyou that upon inspection by a regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials complies with GCP regulations. In\naddition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to\nrepeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register certain clinical trials and post the results of completed\nclinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and\ncivil and criminal sanctions.\nThe third parties with whom we have contracted to help perform our preclinical studies and/or clinical trials may also have relationships with other entities,\nsome of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our\npreclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in\nobtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product\ncandidates, if approved.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or site management organizations terminates, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with\nalternative CROs or site management organizations or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs or site management\norganizations involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO or site\nmanagement organization commences work. As a result, delays could occur, which could compromise our ability to meet our desired development timelines.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently reliant on COH, Fred Hutch, St. Jude, the NIH, UAB, Mayo Clinic, and LUMC for a substantial portion of our research and development\nefforts and the early clinical testing of our product candidates.\nA substantial portion of our research and development has been and will continue to be conducted by COH, Fred Hutch, St. Jude, UAB, Mayo Clinic and\nLUMC pursuant to a sponsored research agreement and/or clinical trial agreements with each of those parties. As a result, our future success is heavily\ndependent on the results of research and development efforts of Dr. Stephen Forman and his team at COH, of Drs. Brian Till and Mazyar Shadman and their\nteam at Fred Hutch, of Drs. Stephen Gottschalk and Ewelina Mamcarz and their team at St. Jude, of Dr. James M. Markert and his team at UAB, of Dr. Larry R.\nPease and his team at Mayo Clinic, and of Dr. Frank J. Staal and his team at LUMC. We have limited control over the nature or timing of their research and\nlimited visibility into their day-to-day activities, and as a result can provide little assurance that their efforts will be successful.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing and may also do so for commercialization,\nif and when our product candidates are approved. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product\ncandidates or any future product candidate or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or\ncommercialization efforts.\nWe may rely on third-party manufacturers or third-party collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of one or more product candidates for which\nour collaborators or we obtain marketing approval. We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable\nterms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including, but\nnot necessarily limited to:\n● reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, while still being required by law to establish adequate oversight and\ncontrol over products furnished by that third party;\n● the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;\n● manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers are unable to obtain raw materials due to supply chain disruptions, give greater priority to the\nsupply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us;\n● the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how; and\n● the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nWe rely on our third-party manufacturers to produce or purchase from third-party suppliers the materials and equipment necessary to produce our product\ncandidates for our preclinical and clinical trials. Forces beyond our control, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the\nglobal supply chain and impact our or our third-party manufacturers’ ability to obtain raw materials or other products necessary to manufacture our product\ncandidates. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials and equipment that we use (or that are used on our behalf) to manufacture our product\ncandidates, and there may be a need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials and equipment necessary to\nproduce our product candidates for our preclinical and clinical trials, and if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. We do not have any control over the\nprocess or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials or equipment by our third-party manufacturers. Any significant delay in the supply of a product\ncandidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing preclinical or clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could\nconsiderably delay completion of our preclinical or clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our\nmanufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials or equipment after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the\ncommercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues\nfrom the sale of our product candidates.\nThe facilities used by contract manufacturers to potentially manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will\nbe conducted after we submit an NDA or BLA to the FDA. We are required by law to establish adequate oversight and control over raw materials, components\nand finished products furnished by our contract manufacturers, but we do not control the day-to-day manufacturing operations of, and are dependent on, the\ncontract manufacturers for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacture of our product candidates. Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply\nwith the cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply\nwith applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, restrictions on imports and exports, civil\npenalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and\ncriminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOne or more of the product candidates that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Any performance failure\non the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for\nredundant supply. If our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturers. We may incur added costs\nand delays in identifying and qualifying any replacement manufacturers.\nFuture dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to\ncommercialize any products that may receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe also expect to rely on other third parties to distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay\nclinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and\ndepriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct all aspects of our LV vector production and these third parties may not perform satisfactorily.\nWe do not independently conduct our LV vector production and we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties with respect to the manufacture\nof these items.\nOur reliance on these third parties for manufacturing LV vector reduces our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure\ncompliance with all required regulations and study protocols. For products that we develop and commercialize, if approved, we will remain responsible for\nensuring that each of our IND-enabling studies and clinical studies is conducted in accordance with the study plan and protocols, and that our LV vectors are\nmanufactured in accordance with GMP as applied in the relevant jurisdictions.\nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, conduct our studies in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements or our stated study plans and protocols, or manufacture our LV vectors in accordance with GMP, we will not be able to complete, or may be\ndelayed in completing, the preclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing process validation activities required to support future IND, market authorization\napplication and BLA submissions and approval of our product candidates, or to support commercialization of our products, if approved. Many of our\nagreements with these third parties contain termination provisions that allow these third parties to terminate their relationships with us at any time. If we need to\nenter into alternative arrangements, our product development and commercialization activities could be delayed.\nWe may be forced to enter into an agreement with a different manufacturer, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the\ntechnical skills required to manufacture LV vector for our drug product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer, and we may have\ndifficulty or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer\nsuch skills at all. Any of these events could lead to clinical study delays or failure to obtain marketing approval or impact our ability to successfully\ncommercialize our product candidates or any future product candidates, if approved. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including\ninjunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nWe rely on clinical data and results obtained by third parties that could ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable.\nAs part of our strategy to mitigate development risk, we seek to develop product candidates with well-studied mechanisms of action, and we utilize biomarkers\nto assess potential clinical efficacy early in the development process. This strategy necessarily relies upon clinical data and other results obtained by third parties\nthat may ultimately prove to be inaccurate or unreliable. Further, such clinical data and results may be based on products or product candidates that are\nsignificantly different from our product candidates or any future product candidate. If the third-party data and results we rely upon prove to be inaccurate,\nunreliable or not applicable to our product candidates or future product candidate, we could make inaccurate assumptions and conclusions about our product\ncandidates and our research and development efforts could be compromised.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development and commercialization of our products. It\nmay be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties, who may or may not be interested\n44\nTable of Contents\nin granting such a license, to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially\nreasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nCollaborative relationships with third parties could cause us to expend significant resources and incur substantial business risk with no assurance of\nfinancial return.\nEstablishing strategic collaborations is difficult and time-consuming. Our discussions with potential collaborators may not lead to the establishment of\ncollaborations on favorable terms, if at all. Potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial, regulatory or\nintellectual property position. In addition, there has been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have\nresulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we successfully establish new collaborations, these relationships may never result in the\nsuccessful development or commercialization of product candidates or the generation of sales revenue. To the extent that we enter into collaborative\narrangements, the related product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold products. Such collaborators may also consider\nalternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more\nattractive than the one with us for any future product candidate.\nRisks Relating to Legislation and Regulation Affecting the Biopharmaceutical and Other Industries\nWe are subject to new legislation, regulatory proposals and managed care initiatives that may increase our costs of compliance and adversely affect our\nability to market our products, obtain collaborators and raise capital.\nIn the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to\nthe healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability\nto profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health\nCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA” or collectively, the “ACA”), substantially regulates the way healthcare is financed by both\ngovernmental and private insurers in the United States. Among other things, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by\nmanufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a\nnon-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government\nprograms; implemented a new methodology under which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that\nare inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes\nResearch Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\nestablished a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) at the CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare\nand Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.\nSince its enactment, there have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional\nchallenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Drug pricing continues to be a subject of debate at the executive and legislative levels of U.S.\ngovernment. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 signed into law by President Biden on March 14, 2021 includes a provision that will eliminated the\nstatutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. With the elimination of the rebate cap, manufacturers may be required\nto compensate states in an amount greater than what the state Medicaid programs pay for the drug. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains\nsubstantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nthat would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, the\nestablishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers of certain drugs payable under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace\ninflation, and requires manufacturers to provide discounts on Part D drugs. Substantial penalties can be assessed for noncompliance with the drug pricing\nprovisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could have the effect of reducing the prices we can charge and\nreimbursement we receive for our product candidates, if approved, thereby reducing our profitability, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, and growth prospects. The effect of Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 on our business and the pharmaceutical industry in general\nis not yet known.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including\nprice or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in\nsome cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe expect that additional federal, state, and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal\nand state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our\nproducts, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.\nThese and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward\npressure on the price that we receive for any current or future product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government\nhealthcare programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare\nreforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates, if approved. Legislative and\nregulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. We cannot be sure whether\nadditional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance, or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes\non the marketing approvals of any current or future product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased Congressional scrutiny of the FDA’s approval\nprocess may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other\nrequirements.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, or\notherwise prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, which could negatively impact our business or the\nbusiness of our partners.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to\nhire and retain key personnel, ability to accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have\nfluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to\nthe political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies,\nwhich would adversely affect our business or the business of our partners. The U.S. government has shut down several times in the past, and certain regulatory\nagencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough nonessential FDA employees and stop routine activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could\nsignificantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the timing of FDA’s review and approval of new products is delayed, the timing of our or our partners’ development process may be delayed, which could\nresult in delayed milestone revenues and materially harm our operations or business.\nOur current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to\napplicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations,\nwhich could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and\nfuture earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the U.S. and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any\nproduct candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly\napplicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False\nClaims Act, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any product candidates\nfor which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal and state\ngovernments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and\nregulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n● The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying\nremuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either (1) the referral of an individual to a person for\nfurnishing any item or service for which payment is available under a federal health care program,\n46\nTable of Contents\nor (2) the purchase, lease, order or recommendation thereof of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is available under a federal health\ncare program;\n· The False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or\ncausing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government or making or using, or causing to be made or used, a false\nrecord or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;\n· The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing\na scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, obtaining money or property of the health care benefit program through false representations or\nknowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making false statements or using or making any false or fraudulent\ndocument in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits or services;\n· HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations,\nwhich imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n· The provision under the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered\ndrugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to track and annually report to CMS payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and\nteaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members in applicable manufacturers\nand group purchasing organizations; applicable manufacturers are also required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value\nprovided, as well as ownership and investment interests held, to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse\nanesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives;\n· The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either\ndirectly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also\nrequires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe\npharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA; and\n· State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and state laws concerning security\nand privacy of health care information, which may differ in substance and application from state-to-state thereby complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It\nis possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law\ninvolving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other\ngovernmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation,\ndamages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or\nrestructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with\nwhom we expect to do business, including our collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or\nadministrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm\nour business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use,\nstorage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals\nand biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and\nwastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures for handling and disposing\nof these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these\n47\nTable of Contents\nlaws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting\nfrom our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur\nsignificant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the\nuse of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental\nliability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or\nfuture laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result\nin substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Potential Disputes Thereof\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for our technology and products, our competitors could develop and commercialize\ntechnology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for product candidates and their formulations and uses. The patent application\nprocess is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or our partners will be successful in obtaining patents or what the\nscope of an issued patent may ultimately be. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n● patent applications may not result in any patents being issued, or the scope of issued patents may not extend to competitive product candidates and\ntheir formulations and uses developed or produced by others;\n● our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than us or our partners, and many of which have made significant investments in\ncompeting technologies, may seek, or may already have obtained, patents that may limit or interfere with our abilities to make, use, and sell potential\nproduct candidates, file new patent applications, or may affect any pending patent applications that we may have;\n● there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside\nand outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n● countries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a\nbetter opportunity to create, develop and market competing products.\nIn addition, patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, or otherwise\nmay not provide any competitive advantage. Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become\ninvolved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent\nrights of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful,\nresulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent positions. An adverse determination in any such submission, patent office trial, proceeding or litigation\ncould reduce the scope of, render unenforceable, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technologies or products and compete\ndirectly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In\naddition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating\nwith us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Third parties are often responsible for maintaining patent protection for our\nproduct candidates, at our and their expense. If that party fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for a product candidate, our abilities to\ndevelop and commercialize products may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing\nproducts. Such a failure to properly protect intellectual property rights relating to any of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent\nclaims to\n48\nTable of Contents\nprotect products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders, as well as affect the validity, enforceability, or scope of\nissued patents.\nWe and our licensors also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect product candidates. Although we have taken steps to protect our and their\ntrade secrets and unpatented know-how, including entering into confidentiality and non-use agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and\ninvention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisers, third parties may still come upon this same or similar information independently.\nDespite these efforts, any of these parties may also breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our or our licensors’ proprietary\ninformation, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to identify such breaches or obtain adequate remedies. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally\ndisclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and\noutside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained\nor independently developed by a competitor, we and our licensors would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that\ntechnology or information to compete with us. If any of our or our licensors’ trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor,\nour competitive positions would be harmed.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a\nreasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify any patentable aspects of our research and development output and\nmethodology, and, even if we do, an opportunity to obtain patent protection may have passed. Given the uncertain and time-consuming process of filing patent\napplications and prosecuting them, it is possible that our product(s) or process(es) originally covered by the scope of the patent application may have changed or\nbeen modified, leaving our product(s) or process(es) without patent protection. If our licensors or we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret\nprotection for one or more product candidates or any future product candidate we may license or acquire, third parties may be able to leverage our proprietary\ninformation and products without risk of infringement, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate\nrevenues and achieve profitability. Moreover, should we enter into other collaborations we may be required to consult with or cede control to collaborators\nregarding the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of licensed patents. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a\nmanner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in\nrecent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical or biotechnology\npatents has emerged to date in the U.S. The patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to\nthe same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the\npatentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the\nactual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not\nat all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent\napplications that we own or licensed, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has\nalso filed a U.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties,\nwe may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. We might also become involved in\nderivation proceedings in an event that a third party misappropriates one or more of our inventions and files their own patent application directed to such one or\nmore inventions. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention (or that a third party\nderived an invention from us) would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent position. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity,\nenforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued\nwhich protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope\nof our patent protection. For example, the federal courts of the U.S. have taken an increasingly dim view of the patent eligibility of certain subject matter, such\nas naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences, amino acid sequences and certain methods of utilizing the same, which include their detection in a biological\nsample and diagnostic conclusions arising from their detection. Such subject matter, which had long been a staple of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical\nindustry to protect their discoveries, is now considered, with few exceptions, ineligible in the first instance for protection under the patent laws of the U.S.\nAccordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed and remain enforceable in our patents or in those licensed from a third party.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from\ncompeting with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by\ndeveloping similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWe also may rely on the regulatory period of market exclusivity for any of our biologic product candidates that are successfully developed and approved for\ncommercialization. Although this period in the United States is generally 12 years from the date of marketing approval (depending on the nature of the specific\nproduct), there is a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend laws to significantly shorten this exclusivity period. Once any regulatory period of exclusivity\nexpires, depending on the status of our patent coverage and the nature of the product, we may not be able to prevent others from marketing products that are\nbiosimilar to or interchangeable with our products, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our licensors to maintain and enforce the intellectual property covering certain of our product candidates. We have limited, if any, control\nover the resources that our licensors can or will devote to securing, maintaining, and enforcing patents protecting our product candidates.\nWe depend on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering our product candidates and we have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of\nresources that they devote on our behalf, or the priority they place on, maintaining patent rights and prosecuting patent applications to our advantage. Moreover,\nwe have limited, if any, control over the strategies and arguments employed in the maintenance of patent rights and the prosecution of patent applications to our\nadvantage. Our licensors might become involved in disputes with one of their other licensees, and we or a portion of our licensed patent rights might become\nembroiled in such disputes.\nOur licensors, depending on the patent or application, are responsible for maintaining issued patents and prosecuting patent applications. We cannot be sure that\nthey will perform as required. Should they decide they no longer want to maintain any of the patents licensed to us, they are required to afford us the\nopportunity to do so at our expense. If our licensors do not perform, and if we do not assume the maintenance of the licensed patents in sufficient time to make\nrequired payments or filings with the appropriate governmental agencies, we risk losing the benefit of all or some of those patent rights. Moreover, and possibly\nunbeknownst to us, our licensors may experience serious difficulties related to their overall business or financial stability, and they may be unwilling or unable\nto continue to expend the financial resources required to maintain and prosecute these patents and patent applications. While we intend to take actions\nreasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we depend, in part, on our licensors to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights and to inform us\nof the status of those protections and efforts thereto.\nOur licensors may also be notified of alleged infringement and be sued for infringement of third-party patents or other proprietary rights. We may have limited,\nif any, control or involvement over the defense of these claims, and our licensors could be subject to injunctions and temporary or permanent exclusionary\norders in the U.S. or other countries. Our licensors are not obligated to defend or assist in our defense against third-party claims of infringement. We have\nlimited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources, if any, that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on defense of such third-\nparty claims of infringement.\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in any patent or other litigation involving proprietary rights, we or our licensors may not be successful in defending claims\nof intellectual property infringement alleged by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Regardless of the outcome\nof any litigation, defending the litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and distracting to management.\nProtecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly, and we may be unable to ensure their protection.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our\nrights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, in addition to being costly and time consuming to undertake. For example:\n● our licensors might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications and issued patents;\n● our licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n● others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our product candidates or any future product candidate technologies;\n● it is possible that none of the pending patent applications licensed to us will result in issued patents;\n● the scope of our issued patents may not extend to competitive products developed or produced by others;\n50\nTable of Contents\n● the issued patents covering our product candidates or any future product candidate may not provide a basis for market exclusivity for active products,\nmay not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties;\n● we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n● intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and\nunsuccessful, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation would harm our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file one or more\nactions for patent infringement, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against accused infringers could provoke these parties to\nassert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents; or provoke those parties to petition the USPTO to institute inter partes review against the\nasserted patents, which may lead to a finding that all or some of the claims of the patent are invalid. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court\nmay decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or refuse to stop the other party from\nusing the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question or as a matter of public policy. An adverse result in any\nlitigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, rendered unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, adverse\nresults on U.S. patents may affect related patents in our global portfolio.\nIf we or our licensors are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome\nin that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability, and the abilities of any of our respective current or future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell\nproduct candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which\nare owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing products, some of which may be directed at claims that overlap with the subject matter\nof our or our licensors’ intellectual property. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to\nus, which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates or proprietary technologies may infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant\nto our product candidates of which we or our licensors are not aware. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual\ndiscoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after a first filing, or in some cases not at all.\nTherefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we or such licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in patents or pending patent applications\nthat we own or licensed, or that we and our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In the event that a third party has also filed a\nU.S. patent application relating to our product candidates or a similar invention, depending upon the priority dates claimed by the competing parties, we may\nhave to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the U.S. The costs of these proceedings could be\nsubstantial, and it is possible that our efforts to establish priority of invention would be unsuccessful, resulting in a material adverse effect on our U.S. patent\nposition. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our or any of our licensors’ patent rights are highly uncertain.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries\ngenerally. If a third party claims that we or any of our licensors, suppliers or collaborators infringe the third party’s intellectual property rights, we may have to,\namong other things:\n● obtain additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n● abandon an infringing product candidate or redesign products or processes to avoid infringement, which may demand substantial funds, time and\nresources and which may result in inferior or less desirable processes and/or products;\n● pay substantial damages, including the possibility of treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at\nissue infringes on or violates the third party’s rights;\n● pay substantial royalties, fees and/or grant cross-licenses to our product candidates; and/or\n● defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly regardless of outcome, and which could result in a substantial diversion of\nfinancial and management resources.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could\ndistract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings,\nmotions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial\nadverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources\navailable for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct\nsuch litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we\ncan because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could\ncompromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under our intellectual property licenses and third party funding arrangements, we could lose rights that are\nimportant to our business.\nWe are currently a party to license agreements with St. Jude, COH, Fred Hutch, University of California at Los Angeles (“UCLA”), Nationwide and other\ninstitutions. In the future, we may become party to licenses that are important for product development and commercialization. If we fail to comply with our\nobligations under current or future license and funding agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we\nmight not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product or utilize any technology that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under\nthe agreements. Such an occurrence could materially and adversely affect the value of a product candidate being developed under any such agreement or could\nrestrict our drug discovery activities. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having\nto negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important\nintellectual property or technology.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees and/or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers\nor other clients.\nAs is common in the biopharmaceutical industry, we rely on employees and consultants to assist in the development of product candidates, many of whom were\npreviously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biopharmaceutical companies, including our\ncompetitors or potential competitors. We may become subject to claims related to whether these individuals have inadvertently or otherwise used, disclosed or\nmisappropriated trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend\nagainst these claims. Even if we are successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and/or\nthe employees or consultants that are implicated.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for our product candidates or any future product candidate, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-\nhow, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or\nobtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We limit disclosure of such trade secrets where possible but we also seek to protect these trade secrets,\nin part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who do have access to them, such as our employees, our licensors, corporate\ncollaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and\ninvention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and may\nunintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such\nbreaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is\nunpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade\nsecrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate\nit, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor,\nour competitive position would be harmed.\n52\nTable of Contents\nWe in-license intellectual property pertaining to certain product candidates from third parties. As such, any dispute with the licensors or the non-\nperformance of such license agreements may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidates.\nThe types of disputes which may arise between us and the third parties from whom we license intellectual property include, but are not limited to:\n● the scope of rights granted under such license agreements and other interpretation-related issues;\n● the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to such license agreements;\n● the scope and interpretation of the representations and warranties made to us by our licensors, including those pertaining to the licensors’ right title and\ninterest in the licensed technology and the licensors’ right to grant the licenses contemplated by such agreements;\n● the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our license agreements and/or collaborative development relationships, and the rights and obligations\nassociated with such sublicensing, including whether or not a given transaction constitutes a sublicense under such license agreement;\n● the diligence and development obligations under license agreements (which may include specific diligence milestones) and what activities or\nachievements satisfy those diligence obligations;\n● whether or not the milestones associated with certain milestone payment obligations have been achieved or satisfied;\n● the applicability or scope of indemnification claims or obligations under such license agreements;\n● the permissibility and advisability of, and strategy regarding, the pursuit of potential third-party infringers of the intellectual property that is the subject\nof such license agreements;\n● the calculation of royalty, sublicense revenue and other payment obligations under such license agreements;\n● the extent to which license rights, if any, are retained by licensors under such license agreements;\n● whether or not a material breach has occurred under such license agreements and the extent to which such breach, if deemed to have occurred, is or\ncan be cured within applicable cure periods, if any;\n● disputes regarding patent filing and prosecution decisions, as well as payment obligations regarding past and ongoing patent expenses;\n● intellectual property rights resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property (including improvements made to licensed intellectual\nproperty) by our and our partners’ licensors and us and our partners; and\n● the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such\nagreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations or may conflict in such a way that puts us in breach of one or more agreements, which would make us\nsusceptible to lengthy and expensive disputes with one or more of such third-party licensing partners. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement\nthat may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be\nour financial or other obligations under the relevant agreements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing\narrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n53\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to Our Control by Fortress\nFortress controls a voting majority of our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Class A Preferred Stock held by Fortress, Fortress is entitled to cast, for each share of Class A Preferred held by Fortress, the\nnumber of votes that is equal to one and one-tenth (1.1) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the shares of outstanding common stock and\n(B) the whole shares of common stock into which the shares of outstanding Class A common shares and the Class A Preferred Stock are convertible and the\ndenominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock. Accordingly, Fortress is able to control or significantly influence all\nmatters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The\ninterests of Fortress may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders, and Fortress may take actions that advance its own interests and are\ncontrary to the desires of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of voting power may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of us even when\nsuch a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as\npart of a sale of our Company or our assets, and might affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nFortress has the right to receive a significant grant of shares of our common stock annually which will result in the dilution of your holdings of common\nstock upon each grant, which could reduce their value.\nUnder the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Founders Agreement (the “Founders Agreement”), which became effective July 22, 2016, Fortress will\nreceive a grant of shares of our common stock equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of the gross amount of any equity or debt financing. Additionally, the\nClass A Preferred Stock, as a class, will receive an annual dividend on January 1st, payable in shares of common stock in an amount equal to two and one-\nhalf percent (2.5%) of our fully-diluted outstanding capital stock as of the business day immediately prior to January 1st of such year. Fortress currently owns\nall outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock. These share issuances to Fortress and any other holder of Class A Preferred Stock will dilute your holdings in\nour common stock and, if the value of our Company has not grown proportionately over the prior year, would result in a reduction in the value of your shares.\nThe Founders Agreement has a term of 15 years and renews automatically for subsequent one-year periods unless terminated by Fortress or upon a Change in\nControl (as defined in the Founders Agreement).\nWe might have received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Fortress.\nThe agreements we have entered into with Fortress include a Management Services Agreement and the Founders Agreement. While we believe the terms of\nthese agreements are reasonable, they might not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm’s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. The\nterms of the agreements relate to, among other things, payment of a royalty on product sales and the provision of employment and transition services. We might\nhave received better terms from third parties because, among other things, third parties might have competed with each other to win our business.\nThe dual roles of our directors who also serve in similar roles with Fortress could create a conflict of interest and will require careful monitoring by our\nindependent directors.\nWe share some directors with Fortress which could create conflicts of interest between the two companies in the future. While we believe that the Founders\nAgreement and the Management Services Agreement were negotiated by independent parties on both sides on arm’s length terms, and the fiduciary duties of\nboth parties were thereby satisfied, in the future situations may arise under the operation of both agreements that may create a conflict of interest. We will have\nto be diligent to ensure that any such situation is resolved by independent parties. In particular, under the Management Services Agreement, Fortress and its\naffiliates are free to pursue opportunities which could potentially be of interest to us, and they are not required to notify us prior to pursuing such opportunities.\nAny conflict of interest or pursuit by Fortress of such a corporate opportunity could expose us to claims by our investors and/or creditors and could harm our\nresults of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we\ncollect, store, and transmit confidential information, including, but not limited to, information related to our intellectual property and proprietary business\ninformation, personal information, and other confidential information. It is critical that we maintain such\n54\nTable of Contents\nconfidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, we have outsourced elements of our operations to third party\nvendors, who each have access to our confidential information, which increases our disclosure risk.\nDespite the implementation of our internal security and business continuity measures and our information technology infrastructure, our internal computer\nsystems and those of current and future third parties on which we rely may fail and are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses and unauthorized access.\nOur information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including corporate firewalls, servers, data center facilities, lab equipment, and connection\nto the internet, face the risk of breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunctions, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and\ntelecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants,\nbusiness partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware,\ndenial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of\ninformation), each of which could compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or\nunauthorized access to, our data or data that is processed or maintained on our behalf, or other assets.\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business\noperations, and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us.\nIn addition, the loss or corruption of, or other damage to, clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory\napproval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug\ncandidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material\nadverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber\nintrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of\nattempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Sophisticated cyber attackers (including foreign adversaries engaged in industrial\nespionage) are skilled at adapting to existing security technology and developing new methods of gaining access to organizations’ sensitive business data, which\ncould result in the loss of proprietary information, including trade secrets. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able\nto implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized\nuntil launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist\norganizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies.\nAny security breach or other event leading to the loss or damage to, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, disclosure, or dissemination of, personal\ninformation, including personal information regarding clinical trial subjects, contractors, directors, or employees, our intellectual property, proprietary business\ninformation, or other confidential or proprietary information, could directly harm our reputation, enable competitors to compete with us more effectively,\ncompel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, or otherwise\nsubject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Each of the foregoing could result in significant\nlegal and financial exposure and reputational damage that could adversely affect our business. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident\ncould impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in\nconnection with any actual or suspected security breach. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents and otherwise\nimplement our internal security and business continuity measures, and actual, potential, or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including\ncosts to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material, and our insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the\npotential losses arising from any such disruption in, or failure or security breach of, our systems or third-party systems where information important to our\nbusiness operations or commercial development is stored or processed. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically\nreasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit,\nregardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention. Furthermore, if the information technology systems of our third-party vendors and\nother contractors and consultants become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may\nhave to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature\nfrom occurring.\n55\nTable of Contents\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, which could cause significant disruptions in our operations.\nHealth pandemics or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have in the past and could again in the future result in quarantines, stay-at-home orders,\nremote work policies or other similar events that may disrupt businesses, delay our research and development programs and timelines, negatively impact\nproductivity and increase risks associated with cybersecurity, the future magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions\nand other limitations. More specifically, these types of events may negatively impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities or the availability or cost\nof materials, which could disrupt our supply chain. In addition, impact on the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities could negatively affect our\nplanned approval processes. Finally, economic conditions and business activity may be negatively impacted and may not recover as quickly as anticipated. The\neffects of epidemics and pandemic are highly uncertain and subject to change. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively,\nour business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur growth is subject to economic and geopolitical conditions.\nOur business is affected by global and local economic and geopolitical conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, inflation, recession, financial\nliquidity, currency volatility, growth, and policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen\nand that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to\naccess capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally.\nGeopolitical changes, including war or other conflicts (including the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas), some of which may be\ndisruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel in the future due to the intense competition for\nqualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our\nbusiness objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional\ncapital and our ability to implement our business strategy.\nOur employees, consultants, or third-party partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including but not necessarily limited to\nnoncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements or internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees, consultants and\npartners are subject, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, consultants, or third-party partners could include intentional\nfailures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with cGMPs, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and\nabuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately, comply with internal procedures, policies or agreements to which such employees,\nconsultants or partners are subject, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry\nare subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may\nrestrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business\narrangements. Employee, consultant, or third-party misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials,\nwhich could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation, as well as civil and criminal liability. The precautions we take to detect and\nprevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other\nactions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not\nsuccessful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the\nimposition of significant fines or other civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nWe receive a large amount of proprietary information from potential or existing licensors of intellectual property and potential acquisition target companies, all\npursuant to confidentiality agreements. The confidentiality and proprietary invention assignment agreements that we have in place with each of our employees\nand consultants prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of such information, but such employees or consultants may nonetheless disclose such information through\nnegligence or willful misconduct. Any such unauthorized disclosures could subject us to monetary damages and/or injunctive or equitable relief. The notes,\nanalyses and memoranda that we have generated based on such information are also valuable to our businesses, and the unauthorized disclosure or\nmisappropriation of such materials by our employees and consultants could significantly harm our strategic initiatives – especially if such disclosures are made\nto our competitors.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on information technology, and any internet or internal computer system failures, inadequacies, interruptions or compromises of our systems or the\nsecurity of confidential information could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nAlthough a significant portion of our business is conducted using traditional methods of contact and communications such as face-to-face meetings, our\nbusiness is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including internet-based systems, to support\nbusiness processes as well as internal and external communications. We could experience system failures and degradations in the future. We cannot assure you\nthat we will be able to prevent an extended and/or material system failure if any of the following or similar events occurs:\n● human error;\n● subsystem, component, or software failure;\n● a power or telecommunications failure;\n● hacker attacks, cyber-attacks, software viruses, security breaches, unauthorized access or intentional acts of vandalism; or\n● terrorist acts or war.\nIf any of the foregoing events were to occur, our business operations could be disrupted in ways that would require the incurrence of substantial expenditures to\nremedy. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our drug development\nprograms. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed clinical trials for one or more of our product conducts could result in delays in our\nregulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to\nresult in a loss of, or damage to, our data and applications, or inappropriate/unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information (including trade\nsecrets), we could incur liability and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe occurrence of a catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits, or we could lose key data which could cause us to curtail or\ncease operations.\nWe are vulnerable to damage and/or loss of vital data from natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, power loss, fire, health epidemics and pandemics,\nfloods and similar events, as well as from accidental loss or destruction. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our businesses could be seriously\nimpaired. We have property, liability and business interruption insurance that may not be adequate to cover losses resulting from disasters or other similar\nsignificant business interruptions, and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage. Any\nsignificant losses that are not recoverable under our insurance policies could seriously impair our business, financial condition and prospects. Any of the\naforementioned circumstances, including without limitation the resurgence of COVID-19 virus, may also impede our employees’ and consultants’ abilities to\nprovide services in-person and/or in a timely manner; hinder our ability to raise funds to finance our operations on favorable terms or at all; and trigger\neffectiveness of “force majeure” clauses under agreements with respect to which we receive goods and services, or under which we are obligated to achieve\ndevelopmental milestones on certain timeframes. Disputes with third parties over the applicability of such “force majeure” clauses, or the enforceability of\ndevelopmental milestones and related extension mechanisms in light of such business interruptions, may arise and may become expensive and time-consuming.\nOur stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prevent\nour stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time\nexperienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n● announcements concerning the progress of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for and, if approved, commercialize our product candidates or any\nfuture product candidate, including any requests we receive from the FDA for additional studies or data that result in delays in obtaining regulatory\napproval or launching these product candidates, if approved;\n57\nTable of Contents\n● market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors or the economy as a whole;\n● price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\n● the failure of one or more of our product candidates or any future product candidate, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n● announcements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n● developments concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n● litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products;\n● actual fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, and concerns by investors that such fluctuations may occur in the future;\n● deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments;\n● additions or departures of key personnel;\n● health care reform legislation, including measures directed at controlling the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and third-party coverage and\nreimbursement policies;\n● developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and\n● discussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management’s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of\nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our stock to decline. In the past, securities class\naction litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because\nbiotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We may become involved in this type of\nlitigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Sale of Our Manufacturing Facility\nAs discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments,” on May 18, 2023, we\nentered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended on June 29, 2023, and July 28, 2023, and certain related agreements with uBriGene relating to the sale\nof our manufacturing facility and related assets (the “Transaction”). The following discussion of risks relating to the Transaction uses certain capitalized terms\nthat are defined in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments, and the following\ndiscussion of risks should be read together with such discussion of the Transaction.\nWe may be unable to complete the Transaction as anticipated if the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) determines to\nimplement mitigating measures, including the potential divestment of some or all of the Transferred Assets by uBriGene; any such mitigating measures may\nlimit our ability to realize the anticipated cost savings of the sale of the Facility and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nPursuant to the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene agreed to cause our respective affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain\nclearance for the Transaction from CFIUS, although obtaining such clearance was not a condition to closing the Transaction. In accordance with the Amended\nAsset Purchase Agreement, together with uBriGene, we submitted a joint notice to CFIUS on August 10, 2023.\nFollowing an initial 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period, on November 13, 2023, CFIUS requested that we and uBriGene\nwithdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature and extent of national security risk posed by\nthe Transaction. Upon CFIUS’s request, we and uBriGene submitted a request to withdraw and re-file our\n58\nTable of Contents\njoint voluntary notice to CFIUS, and on November 13, 2023, CFIUS granted this request, accepted the joint voluntary notice and commenced a new 45-day\nreview period on November 14, 2023. CFIUS’s 45-day review ended on December 28, 2023. Since CFIUS had not concluded its review by December 28,\n2023, the proceeding transitioned to a subsequent 45-day investigation period, which ended on February 12, 2024.\nFollowing the 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period described above, on February 12, 2024, we and uBriGene requested permission\nto withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature and extent of national security risk posed\nby the Transaction. Upon our and uBriGene’s request to withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to CFIUS, on February 12, 2024, CFIUS granted this\nrequest, accepted the joint voluntary notice and commenced a new 45-day review period on February 13, 2024. The new 45-day review period will conclude no\nlater than March 28, 2024. If CFIUS does not conclude its review by March 28, 2024, the proceeding will transition to a second 45-day phase as CFIUS further\ninvestigates the Transaction.\nAt the completion of its review and, if applicable, investigation, if CFIUS determines there are no unresolved national security concerns, it will apprise the\nparties of its determination and conclude all action on the matter. Alternatively, CFIUS may identify and impose mitigation measures. Depending on the nature\nand severity of perceived national security risks identified during its investigation, CFIUS may, among other mitigation measures, require suspension of the\nTransaction, require uBriGene to divest some or all of the Transferred Assets, forfeit contracts CFIUS deems to be sensitive, or require appointment of special\ncompliance personnel or a proxy board consisting of U.S. persons. If CFIUS determines to require mitigating measures with respect to the Transaction, then\nuBriGene must comply with such measures although the Closing Date has already occurred.\nIf CFIUS requires uBriGene to divest the Transferred Assets, uBriGene is not required to sell the Transferred Assets back to us and could instead elect to sell the\nTransferred Assets to a third-party purchaser. If uBriGene sells the Transferred Assets to a third-party purchaser, the manufacturing and production of our lead\nproduct candidate may be disrupted. Under the terms of the MSA, uBriGene will manufacture our lead product candidate, including MB-106, upon the\ncompletion of the sale of the Facility. Pursuant to the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, we will perform the manufacturing services to be performed by\nuBriGene under the MSA until the sale of the Facility is completed in exchange for an amount equal to our operating costs associated with our CDMO\nManufacturing Services.\nIf uBriGene sells the Transferred Assets to a third-party purchaser, there can be no assurance that such third-party purchaser will continue to contract with us for\nour CDMO Manufacturing Services. Any third-party purchaser of the Transferred Assets may not be willing to contract with us to provide Company CDMO\nManufacturing Services. In addition, a third-party purchaser may not be able to comply with cGMP or similar regulatory requirements related to the production\nof our lead product candidates or otherwise may not be able to provide manufacturing services on quality and timeliness standards that are acceptable to us. In\neither such case, the manufacturing of our lead product candidate may need to be transferred to an unknown CDMO and may be at risk of delays, disruptions or\nquality issues, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our lead product candidate and our ability to conduct clinical trials and receive\nregulatory approval.\nIf CFIUS requires uBriGene to divest the Transferred Assets and uBriGene sells the Transferred Assets back to us, we will incur significant costs associated\nwith the repurchase and continued operation of the Facility. In addition to the payment of the repurchase price of the Facility, we will cease to be reimbursed by\nuBriGene for our CDMO Manufacturing Services and, as a result, will experience substantially increased expenses in connection with operating the Facility and\nmanufacturing our lead product candidate, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, prospects and ability to operate\nas a going concern.\nCertain key personnel may depart the Company upon the completion of the sale of the facility, which may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated\nbenefits of the transaction; unfortunately, key personnel may also depart the Company in the event that we are unable to complete the facility transfer.\nOur ability to receive the Contingent Amount from uBriGene is subject to receipt of the Landlord’s consent to the Proposed Lease Transfer and our ability\nto raise additional capital; if we do not receive such consent from the Landlord and/or are unable to raise the requisite amount of capital, we will not\nreceive the full purchase price for the Transaction which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nPursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, in addition to the base purchase price paid to us upon closing of the Transaction, uBriGene will also pay a\nContingent Amount to us as consideration of the Transaction once we (i) complete an issuance of equity securities in an amount equal to or greater than\n$10,000,000 (the “Contingent Capital Raise”) and (ii) obtains the consent of the Landlord to the Proposed Lease Transfer. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ncompleted issuances of equity securities for proceeds totaling approximately $4.6 million following the Closing Date. If we are unable to close the full amount\nof the Contingent Capital Raise and/or do not receive the Landlord’s\n59\nTable of Contents\nconsent to the Proposed Lease Transfer within two years from the Closing Date, uBriGene will no longer be obligated to pay the Contingent Amount to us.\nIf we do not receive the Contingent Amount our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operation and ability to operate as a going concern will be\nmaterially and adversely affected, and we may be required to implement further cost reduction strategies.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe have established certain processes for identifying, evaluating, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats as a part of our overall technology\nmanagement strategy. These processes are designed and reassessed on a periodic basis to help protect our technology assets and operations from internal and\nexternal security threats. We also engage with third parties, including consultants, to enhance our security processes.\nWe have previously engaged and currently engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity and technology management strategy and\ncontinue to seek to implement new, and improve existing, processes regularly to adjust for changes in technology, internal or external threats, business strategy,\nand regulatory requirements. We, and our third parties, have deployed managed detection and response services to monitor our technology infrastructure and\ninformation systems for possible threats. Our technology management strategy also includes ongoing security training and education for employees regarding\nthreats, including their role and responsibility in detecting and responding to such threats.\nWe review the processes of our third-party vendors and consider their ability to adhere to relevant industry practices and maintain adequate technology risk\nprograms. In addition, we maintain cyber and cyber-related crime insurance coverage policies as part of our overall risk management strategy, however, our\npolicies may not be sufficient to cover against all potential future claims, if any.\nIn the last two fiscal years, we have not identified cybersecurity threats that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition. Although we proactively attempt to prevent all threats, we are unable to eliminate all risk from cybersecurity threats\nor provide assurance that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. For more information about these risks, please see Item 1A. Risk\nFactors “Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks, or deficiencies in our or third parties’ cybersecurity.”\nCybersecurity Governance\nWhile our board of directors is responsible for oversight and risk management in general, our Audit Committee provides oversight of our technology\nmanagement strategy to ensure that cybersecurity threats and risks are identified, evaluated, and managed. The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from\nour management team regarding the overall state of our technology management strategy and any relevant risks from cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity\nincidents.\nOur management team is responsible for assessing and managing the material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our management team members have expertise\nin information systems, compliance and corporate governance, which we believe are disciplines that are effective in the management of the Company’s\ncybersecurity risk. Our management team is informed of and monitors the prevention, detection, and mitigation of cybersecurity threats and incidents.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate and executive office is located at 377 Plantation Street, Worcester, MA 01605.\nOn October 27, 2017, we entered into a lease agreement with WCS - 377 Plantation Street, Inc., a Massachusetts nonprofit corporation (“Landlord”). Pursuant\nto the terms of the lease agreement, we agreed to lease 27,043 sf from the Landlord, located at 377 Plantation Street\n60\nTable of Contents\nin Worcester, MA (the “Plantation Street Facility”), through November 2026, subject to additional extensions at our option. Base rent, net of abatements of $0.6\nmillion over the lease term, totals approximately $3.6 million, on a triple-net basis.\nThe Plantation Street Facility became operational for the production of personalized CAR T and gene therapies in 2018.\nOn June 14, 2022, we entered into a sublease agreement with The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company. Pursuant to the terms of the sublease agreement, we\nagreed to sublease 26,503 square feet, located at 1 Mercantile Street, Worcester, MA (the “Mercantile Street Facility”), through January 2030. Base rent, net of\nabatements of $1.2 million, totals approximately $3.4 million. On July 18, 2023, we executed, with a retroactive effective date of June 15, 2023, a Third\nAmendment to the Sublease, with the Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, pursuant to which we relocated from the 26,503 square feet of rentable space on the\nfourth floor of the Mercantile Street Facility to 11,916 square feet of rentable space on the second floor. There were no modifications to the lease term. The\nreduction of the rentable space resulted in a decrease in the base rent and abatements. Base rent, net of abatements of $0.2 million, totals approximately $1.6\nmillion, for the reduced space.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe have submitted a joint voluntary notice to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) in connection with the sale of\nmanufacturing facility and associated assets to a third party. Such transaction is currently under review by CFIUS. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nof Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments” for additional information.\nExcept as set forth above, we are not involved in any legal proceedings that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results\nof operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization\nor body pending or, to the knowledge of our executive officers, threatened against or affecting our company or our officers or directors in their capacities as\nsuch.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the Results of Operations\nStatements in the following discussion and throughout this Form 10-K that are not historical in nature are “forward-looking statements.” You can identify\nforward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “intend,” “believe,” and similar\nexpressions. Although we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently subject to risk\nand we can give no assurances that our expectations will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ from those described in this report because of numerous\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation, those described under Item 1A “Risk Factors.” We undertake no\nobligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual outcomes. Please see\n“Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes\nthereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in the\ndiscussion of our financial condition and results of operations to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual outcomes.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell and gene therapies into potential cures for\nhematologic cancers, solid tumors and rare genetic diseases. We aim to acquire rights to these technologies by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership\ninterest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-licensing or bringing the technologies to market.\nOur pipeline is currently focused in three core areas: CAR T therapies for hematologic malignancies, CAR T therapies for solid tumors and gene therapies for\nrare genetic disorders. For each therapy we have partnered with world class research institutions. For our CAR T therapies we have partnered with COH, Fred\nHutch, Nationwide and Mayo Clinic. For our gene therapies, we have partnered with St. Jude in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral treatment of\nXSCID and with LUMC in the development of a first-in-class ex vivo lentiviral treatment of RAG1-SCID.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses for the foreseeable future relating to research, development and commercialization of our potential products. However,\nthere can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional resources when needed, on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, there exists\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the\nrecoverability of assets that might be necessary despite this uncertainty.\nCAR T Therapies\nOur pipeline of CAR T therapies is being developed under exclusive licenses from several world class research institutions. Our strategy is to license these\ntechnologies, support preclinical and clinical research activities by our academic partners and transfer the underlying technology to our or our contract\nmanufacturer’s cell processing facility, in order to conduct our own clinical trials.\nWe are developing a CAR T therapy for hematologic malignancies in partnership with Fred Hutch targeting CD20 (MB-106). On May 18, 2023, we announced\na series of changes resulting from a review of our portfolio of product candidates to determine the future strategy of our programs and the proper allocation of\nour resources. Following this review, we determined to discontinue development of our MB-102 (CD123), MB-103 (HER2), MB-104 (CS1) and MB-105\n(PSCA) programs (such programs, the “Discontinued Programs”), comprising a portion of our portfolio of CAR T therapies being developed by us in\npartnership with City of Hope.\n62\nTable of Contents\nMB-106 (CD20-targeted CAR T cell therapy for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia)\nIn August 2023, we announced the first data from the indolent lymphoma cohort of our company-sponsored multicenter clinical trial, demonstrating clinical\nresponses as well as safety and efficacy consistent with the ongoing Phase 1/2 Fred Hutch-sponsored clinical trial. The multicenter study data showed\nsubstantial clinical benefit in four of four patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”) at the starting dose of 3.3 x 106 CAR-T\ncells/kg, a dose comparable to that employed for the majority of the indolent lymphoma patients in the Fred Hutch trial. The multicenter data also showed\npersistence of CAR-T cells at 6+ months and favorable safety data, with only Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome reported to date in each of the 4 patients and\nno immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome of any grade reported in any patient. Two patients with follicular lymphoma had complete response\nby both PET-CT and bone marrow, one of whom had been previously treated with a CD19-directed CAR-T. A third patient, with a diagnosis of WM, who had\nnine prior treatments and high disease burden, achieved a very good partial response characterized by complete metabolic response by PET-CT, morphologic\nclearance of lymphoma in bone marrow, and resolution of the IgM monoclonal protein. The fourth patient, with a diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia variant, who\nhad been heavily transfusion dependent, continued to have stable disease with decreased disease in his bone marrow and achieved complete transfusion\nindependence, which was ongoing at six plus months. Following treatment of these four indolent NHL patients, the Safety Review Committee unanimously\napproved dose escalation in the indolent lymphoma cohort to the second and final dose level of 1.0 x 107 CAR-T cells/kg.\nIn December 2023, we presented interim Phase 1/2 data from our multicenter clinical trial at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. taking\nplace December 8 through 12, 2023. At this meeting, we presented data for the 9 patients (5 FL, 3 WM and 1 hairy cell leukemia variant) treated in the indolent\nNHL arm of the multicenter clinical trial. As planned, 2 dose levels (DL1=3.3×106 CAR T-cells/kg [n=4] and DL2=1.0×107 CAR T-cells/kg [n=5]) were\nevaluated. All patients responded clinically, yielding an overall response rate of 100% among the FL and WM patients. All 5 FL patients, including 2 who had\nprior CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, achieved a complete response. Among the WM patients, 1 achieved a very good partial response and 2 achieved a partial\nresponse. The hairy cell leukemia variant patient experienced stable disease and achieved transfusion independence. The data demonstrate that MB-106 has a\ntolerable safety profile, with no occurrence of CRS above grade 1 and no occurrence of ICANS of any grade, despite not using prophylactic tocilizumab or\ndexamethasone. MB-106 expansion and persistence was demonstrated in these patients. Additionally, outpatient administration of MB-106 was allowed and\nfound to be feasible.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects to receive FDA feedback in an End-of-Phase 1 Meeting on its strategy to conduct a non-randomized\nregistrational multicenter trial in relapsed or refractory WM. In the second half of 2024, the Company expects to treat the first patient in that trial, which could\nenable top-line results in the second half of 2026. In order to facilitate interactions with the FDA throughout this process, we anticipate requesting Regenerative\nMedicine Advanced Therapy (‘RMAT’) designation for indolent lymphoma – which includes WM – from the FDA in the first half of 2024. We are currently\nevaluating the extent to which we can continue the development of MB-106 in other NHL subtypes, subject to allocation of resources.\nMB-109 (Combination of MB-101 CAR T Therapy with MB-108 Oncolytic Virus Therapy for Malignant Brain Tumors)\nIn April 2022, we announced interim data from two ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating two clinical candidates, MB‐101\n(IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR T cell therapy licensed from City of Hope) and MB-108 (herpes simplex virus type 1 oncolytic virus licensed from Nationwide\nChildren’s Hospital) for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.\nOn October 26, 2023, we announced that the FDA accepted our IND application for MB-109 for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (“GBM”) and high-\ngrade astrocytoma. We are evaluating the timing for initiation of a Phase 1 multicenter clinical trial at City of Hope and the University of Alabama at\nBirmingham (“UAB”) to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MB-109 in adult patients with recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas that express\nIL13Rα2 on the surface of the tumor cells, subject to allocation of resources.\nIn March 2024, we announced the publication of Phase 1 data demonstrating the safety and promising clinical activity of MB-101 in patients with recurrent and\nrefractory malignant glioma, including glioblastoma, in Nature Medicine. Stable disease or better was achieved in 50% (29/58) of heavily pretreated patients\nlasting at least 2 months, with 2 partial responses, 1 complete response, and a second complete response in a patient with recurrent glioblastoma who received\nadditional CAR T-cell cycles off-protocol. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who received MB-101, manufactured using an optimized process, via dual\nintratumoral (ICT)/ intraventricular (ICV) delivery exhibited a superior median overall survival of 10.2 months, compared the expected survival rate of 6.0\nmonths in patients with recurrent GBM. MB-101 delivered via ICT, ICV or dual ICT/ICV delivery was generally well-tolerated, with no dose limiting toxicities\nobserved at doses up to 200×106 CAR T-cells. Higher levels of CD3+ T-cells in the tumor milieu prior to treatment was associated superior median overall\nsurvival, suggesting that immunologically “hot” tumors respond better to MB-101.\n63\nTable of Contents\nIn Vivo CAR T Platform Technology\nWe are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic to develop a novel technology that may be able to transform the administration of CAR T therapies and potentially\nbe used as an off-the-shelf therapy. In 2024, the Mayo Clinic expects to submit in vivo proof-of-concept data in a mouse model of cancer to a major scientific\njournal. We are evaluating plans to file an IND application for a multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial once a lead construct has been identified, subject to allocation\nof resources.\nGene Therapies\nMB-117 (previously referred to as MB-107) (Ex vivo LV Gene Therapy for Newly Diagnosed X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (XSCID)) and MB-\n217 (previously referred to as MB-207) (Ex vivo LV Gene Therapy for Previously Transplanted XSCID)\nIn partnership with St. Jude, our XSCID gene therapy programs are being conducted under an exclusive license to develop a potentially curative treatment for\nXSCID, a rare genetic immune system condition in which affected patients do not live beyond infancy without treatment. St. Jude’s first-in-class ex vivo LV\ngene therapy has been utilized in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials involving two different autologous cell products produced via transduction of patients’\nhematopoietic stem cells using a predecessor LV vector. These cell products were designated MB-107 and MB-207, and the respective Phase 1/2 clinical trials\nwere: a multicenter trial of the MB-107 product in newly diagnosed infants sponsored by St. Jude (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01512888; referred to at\nSt. Jude as LVXSCID-ND) and a single-center trial of the MB-207 product in previously transplanted patients sponsored by the National Institutes of Health\n(“NIH”) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01306019; referred to at the NIH as LVXSCID-OC).\nGoing forward, this predecessor LV vector will be replaced by a modified LV vector which will be used to produce the MB-117 and MB-217 cell products. In\n2024, following availability of the modified LVV, we expect that St. Jude will initiate its Phase 1 trial to treat newly diagnosed infants with MB-117 and that the\nNIH will initiate its Phase 1 trial to treat previously transplanted patients with MB-217.\nLUMC License\nMB-110, a first-in-class ex vivo treatment for RAG1 SCID, is currently being evaluated at LUMC in a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial in Europe. In 2022 the\nfirst patient was treated without any complications, after which the patient developed a functioning immune system which responded well to the standard\nvaccinations for newborns. We are evaluating the extent to which we will progress this program, subject to allocation of resources.\nRecent Events\nSale of Manufacturing Facility – Overview of Transaction\nAs previously disclosed, on May 18, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Original Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene (Boston)\nBiosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“uBriGene”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell our leasehold interest in our cell processing facility located in\nWorcester, Massachusetts (the “Facility”), and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility to\nuBriGene (the “Transaction”). We and uBriGene subsequently entered into Amendment No. 1, dated as of June 29, 2023, and Amendment No. 2, dated as of\nJuly 28, 2023, to the Original Asset Purchase Agreement (the Original Asset Purchase Agreement, as so amended, the “Asset Purchase Agreement”).\nOn July 28, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, we completed the sale of all of our assets that primarily relate to the\nmanufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (such operations, the “Transferred Operations” and such assets, the “Transferred Assets”)\nto uBriGene for upfront consideration of $6 million cash (the “Base Amount”). The Transferred Assets that were transferred to uBriGene on the Closing Date\ninclude, but are not limited to: (i) our leases of equipment and other personal property and all other property, equipment, machinery, tools, supplies, inventory,\nfixtures and all other personal property primarily related to the Transferred Operations, (ii) the data, information, methods, quality management systems, and\nintellectual property primarily used for the purposes of the Transferred Operations, (iii) the records and filings, including customer and vendor lists, production\ndata, standard operating procedures and business records relating to, used in or arising under the Transferred Operations and (iv) all transferrable business\nlicense, permits and approvals necessary to operate the Transferred Operations. As described in greater detail below, certain Transferred Assets, including our\nlease of the Facility and contracts that are primarily used in the Transferred Operations (the “Transferred Contracts”) did not transfer to uBriGene on the Closing\nDate.\n64\nTable of Contents\nUnder the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, in addition to the Base Amount, uBriGene will be obligated to pay us a contingent amount (the “Contingent\nAmount”) if we, within two years from the Closing Date: (i) complete an issuance of equity securities in an aggregate amount equal to or greater than $10.0\nmillion after the closing (the “Contingent Capital Raise”) and (ii) obtain the consent of the landlord of the Facility to transfer the lease of the Facility to\nuBriGene (as discussed under “—Transfer of Lease of the Facility” below). As of December 31, 2023, we had completed issuances of equity securities for\nproceeds totaling approximately $4.6 million following the Closing Date. If we are unable to close the full amount of the Contingent Capital Raise and/or do not\nreceive the Landlord’s consent to the transfer the lease of the Facility to uBriGene within two years from the Closing Date, uBriGene will not be obligated to\npay the Contingent Amount to us. The Contingent Amount to be paid to us upon the satisfaction of the conditions listed above will be an amount equal to $5.0\nmillion less (i) any severance payments or other monetary obligations to our employees who support the Transferred Operations and who have accepted offers\nof employment with uBriGene that arise between the Closing Date and the date the lease transfers to uBriGene and (ii) any payments payable by us under\nTransferred Contracts in connection with the consummation of the Transaction, including any payments necessary to obtain third party consents.\nVoluntary Notice to U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States\nuBriGene is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UBrigene (Jiangsu) Biosciences Co., Ltd., a Chinese contract development and manufacturing\norganization. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance for the Transaction from the\nU.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), although obtaining such clearance was not a condition to closing the Transaction. In\naccordance with the Asset Purchase Agreement, we and uBriGene previously submitted a voluntary notice to CFIUS on August 10, 2023.\nFollowing an initial 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period, on November 13, 2023, CFIUS requested that we and uBriGene\nwithdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature and extent of national security risk posed by\nthe Transaction. Upon CFIUS’s request, we and uBriGene submitted a request to withdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to CFIUS, and on November\n13, 2023, CFIUS granted this request, accepted the joint voluntary notice and commenced a new 45-day review period on November 14, 2023. CFIUS’s 45-day\nreview ended on December 28, 2023. Since CFIUS had not concluded its review by December 28, 2023, the proceeding transitioned to a subsequent 45-day\ninvestigation period, which ended on February 12, 2024.\nFollowing the 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period described above, on February 12, 2024, we and uBriGene requested permission\nto withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature and extent of national security risk posed\nby the Transaction. Upon our and uBriGene’s request to withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to CFIUS, on February 12, 2024, CFIUS granted this\nrequest, accepted the joint voluntary notice and commenced a new 45-day review period on February 13, 2024. The new 45-day review period will conclude no\nlater than March 28, 2024. If CFIUS does not conclude its review by March 28, 2024, the proceeding will transition to a second 45-day phase as CFIUS further\ninvestigates the Transaction.\nAt the completion of its review and, if applicable, investigation, if CFIUS determines there are no unresolved national security concerns, CFIUS will apprise the\nparties of its determination and conclude all action on the matter. Alternatively, CFIUS may identify and impose mitigation measures. Depending on the nature\nand severity of perceived national security risks identified, CFIUS may, among other mitigation measures, require suspension of the Transaction, require\nuBriGene to divest the Facility or other assets relating thereto, forfeit contracts that CFIUS deems to be sensitive, or require appointment of special compliance\npersonnel or a proxy board consisting of U.S. persons. If CFIUS determines to require mitigating measures with respect to the Transaction, then uBriGene must\ncomply with such measures although the Closing Date has already occurred.\nWe and uBriGene have been and will continue to be actively engaged with CFIUS, and they remain fully committed to obtaining clearance from CFIUS and\ncompleting the full transfer of the Facility to uBriGene. There can be no assurance, however, that CFIUS will ultimately provide clearance with respect to the\nTransaction, or what mitigating measures may be required in order to obtain such clearance.\nTransfer of Lease of the Facility\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contemplates that we will seek to procure the consent and approval of the landlord of the Facility, WCS-377 Plantation Street,\nInc. (the “Landlord”), of either (i) an assignment and assumption agreement to be executed by us and uBriGene pursuant to which uBriGene would assume our\nlease of the Facility or (ii) a new lease agreement by and between uBriGene and the Landlord with respect to the Facility on terms and conditions acceptable to\nuBriGene (the “Proposed Lease Transfer”). Because the Landlord had not consented to the Proposed Lease Transfer as of the Closing Date, our lease of the\nFacility did not transfer to uBriGene on the Closing Date.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe Landlord has informed us that it will not consider our request for the Proposed Lease Transfer until we receive the final determination letter from CFIUS\n(the “CFIUS Letter”) with respect to the Transaction and provide the Landlord with a reasonably detailed summary of Mustang and uBriGene’s reaction to such\nfinal determination (the “Reaction Summary”). Upon the Landlord’s receipt of the CFIUS Letter and the Reaction Summary, the Landlord will have an\nadditional thirty business days to make its determination on the Proposed Lease Transfer. If CFIUS conclude its action with respect to the Transaction by the\nend of its new 45-day review period ending March 28, 2024, then the landlord would be expected to deliver its decision regarding the Proposed Lease Transfer\nby April 27, 2024.\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, the lease of the Facility is to be transferred to uBriGene within three business days following receipt of the Landlord’s\nconsent to the Proposed Lease Transfer, if such consent is received. Unless and until the lease is transferred to uBriGene, we will retain our facility lease and\nfacility personnel, and will continue to occupy the leasehold premises and manufacture there our lead product candidates, including MB-106, pursuant to the\narrangements described below under “Manufacturing Services Agreement and Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement”.\nuBriGene’s Right to Deliver a Repurchase Notice with Respect to the Transferred Assets\nBecause the Facility was not assigned to uBriGene within 120 days following the Closing Date, so long as the lease has not been so assigned, uBriGene may\ndeliver a notice to us indicating its intention to enter into good faith negotiations (the “Repurchase Notice”) to provide for us to repurchase the Transferred\nAssets, re-assume the transferred liabilities and resume all Transferred Operations for a repurchase price equal to the purchase price of the Transaction actually\npaid by uBriGene as of the repurchase date (“Repurchase Transaction”). Upon receipt of such Repurchase Notice, we and uBriGene have agreed to use our best\ncommercial efforts to negotiate in good faith the terms of any such Repurchase Transaction.\nTransferred Employees and Transferred Contracts\nUnder the Asset Purchase Agreement, uBriGene has agreed to (or cause one of its affiliates to) offer employment to no less than forty Company employees who\nsupport operations at the Facility on terms with base salary or hourly wages, target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based compensation) and retirement\nand welfare benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by us immediately prior to the closing of the Transaction. Employees who receive and accept\noffers of employment from uBriGene are the “Transferred Employees.”\nBecause the lease of the Facility did not transfer to uBriGene on the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees and our rights in, to and under the Transferred\nContracts also did not transfer to uBriGene on the Closing Date. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Transferred Employees will become\nemployees of uBriGene effective on the date that is 30 days following the completion of the Proposed Lease Transfer, and the Transferred Contracts will\ntransfer to uBriGene on the date on which Mustang and uBriGene confirm in writing that the Landlord has notified us or uBriGene of its consent to the\nProposed Lease Transfer.\nManufacturing Services Agreement and Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement\nAs contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, we and uBriGene entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (the\n“Manufacturing Services Agreement”). Under the Manufacturing Services Agreement, we contracted uBriGene to manufacture our lead product candidates,\nincluding MB-106, and we committed to spend at least $8.0 million over a period of two years after the closing of the Transaction to purchase manufacturing\nand related services (the “Manufacturing Services”) from uBriGene (the “Minimum Commitment”). We paid uBriGene 25% of the Minimum Commitment at\nthe time of signing of the Manufacturing Services Agreement and will pay the remainder of the Minimum Commitment over the following two years. Subject to\nour payment of our Minimum Commitment, uBriGene will provide to us a manufacturing rebate, payable in cash at the end of the second year of the\nManufacturing Services Agreement term, for any amounts paid for Manufacturing Services in excess of the Minimum Commitment (but in no event will such\nrebate exceed $3.0 million). In connection with the Manufacturing Services Agreement, we will provide uBriGene with the customary licenses to use\nintellectual property rights specific to our cell and gene therapies to the extent reasonably necessary for uBriGene’s performance under the Manufacturing\nServices Agreement.\nIn addition, as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, we and uBriGene entered into a sub-contracting Manufacturing Services\nAgreement (the “Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement”), pursuant to which uBriGene contracted us to perform the Manufacturing Services to be performed by\nuBriGene under the Manufacturing Services Agreement and granted us a revocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Transferred Assets in\nconnection with the performance of such services. Under the terms of the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, we will manufacture our lead product\ncandidates, including MB-106 (the “Company CDMO Manufacturing Services”), and may from time to time manufacture other products as requested by\nuBriGene. Pursuant to the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, the price to be paid by uBriGene in exchange for the Company CDMO Manufacturing Services\nwill be an amount equal\n66\nTable of Contents\nto the sum of: (i) the base salary and hourly wages for the Transferred Employees for time spent performing the Company CDMO Manufacturing Services,\n(ii) the fees, payments, costs and expenses payable by us to third parties under any of the Transferred Contracts used to perform the CDMO Manufacturing\nServices (so long as such amounts are generally consistent with amounts paid by us under such Transferred Contracts immediately prior to the Closing Date and\nsuch amounts did not become payable as a result of a breach of, a default under, a termination, a cancellation or an acceleration of any right or obligation under\nthe Transferred Contracts), and (iii) any other amounts approved in advance in writing by uBriGene. As of the date hereof, uBriGene has not notified us of any\nplans to request any manufacturing services under the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, other than the Company CDMO Manufacturing Services. In\naddition, under the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement, Mustang and uBriGene agreed to establish a joint steering committee comprising two representatives\nfrom each of Mustang and uBriGene to review, discuss and decide on operational matters relating to the services to be performed by us under such agreement,\nincluding matters relating to expenses. In addition, we agreed to permit uBriGene to locate up to three of uBriGene’s personnel at the Facility so as to\nparticipate in meetings of the joint steering committee and allow for in-person feedback and decision-marking regarding the services to be performed by us.\nIn addition to other customary termination events, in the event uBriGene delivers the Repurchase Notice, the Manufacturing Services Agreement and the Sub-\nContracting CDMO Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (i) the closing of the Repurchase Transaction or (ii) 60 days after the delivery of the\nRepurchase Notice.\nWe intend to expense manufacturing costs under the MSA and Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement and account for reimbursed costs associated with the\nagreements as an offset to such expense. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we expensed $4.1 million of manufacturing costs under the MSA and have a\nreceivable of $3.2 million, net of payments received of $2.4 million, for reimbursed costs associated with the Sub-Contracting CDMO agreement.\nTransition Services Agreement and Quality Services Agreement\nOn the Closing Date, the parties also entered into a Quality Services Agreement, pursuant to which we and uBriGene agreed to specified duties for each party\nwith respect to the contract manufacture by uBriGene of our product candidates. The Quality Services Agreement sets forth the quality activities associated with\nthe production, analysis, and release of such products and assigns responsibility for each activity to us and/or uBriGene. The Quality Services Agreement\nterminates upon the earlier of: (i) the date of expiration of the MSA or (ii) the date of termination of the MSA.\nIn addition, as contemplated by the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, we and uBriGene entered into a Transition Services Agreement,\nwhich will become effective upon completion of the Proposed Lease Transfer (if such Proposed Lease Transfer is completed). Pursuant to the Transition\nServices Agreement, we will provide certain transitional services to uBriGene to ensure the smooth transition of operations and continuity of business for a\nperiod of six months after the effective date of the Transition Services Agreement, unless otherwise extended upon the mutual agreement of us and uBriGene.\nImpact of Landlord Consent to the Proposed Lease Transfer on the Transaction\nIn the event the Landlord consents to the Proposed Lease Transfer, it is expected that the lease to the Facility and the Transferred Employees of the Facility will\nbe transferred to uBriGene as described above, in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In addition, following receipt of the Landlord’s\nconsent to the Proposed Lease Transfer (if such consent is received), the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement will be terminated no later than 30 days following\ncompletion of the Proposed Lease Transfer, following which uBriGene will commence the Manufacturing Services in connection with our lead product\ncandidates, including MB-106, pursuant to the Manufacturing Services Agreement. If, however, the Landlord does not consent to the Proposed Lease Transfer\nthe parties may mutually agree to extend the term of the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement indefinitely and uBriGene may continue to procure manufacturing\nservices (including our CDMO Manufacturing Services) from us. In the event the Landlord does not consent to the Proposed Lease Transfer within 120 days of\nclosing, uBriGene may deliver the Repurchase Notice to us, following which the parties will negotiate in good faith regarding the Repurchase Transaction. By\ntheir terms, the Manufacturing Services Agreement and the Sub-Contracting CDMO Agreement terminate upon the earlier of (i) the closing of the Repurchase\nTransaction or (ii) 60 days after the delivery of the Repurchase Notice.\nRisks Relating to the Transaction\nWe are exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties relating to the Transaction. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Sale of Our Manufacturing\nFacility” for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur financial statements include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Our significant estimates include, but are not\nlimited to, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets and amortizable intangible assets, fair value of stock options and warrants, stock-based compensation,\naccrued expenses, provisions for income taxes and contingencies. Due to the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these\nestimates. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to\nunderstanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we\nbelieve that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development\nactivities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. Upfront and\nmilestone payments due to third parties that perform research and development services on our behalf will be expensed as services are rendered or when the\nmilestone is achieved.\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based\ncompensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments made to third party\ncontract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing\nclinical trial materials, and costs associated with regulatory filings, laboratory costs and other supplies.\nIn accordance with ASC 730 10 25 1, Research and Development, costs incurred in obtaining technology licenses are charged to research and development\nexpense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and has no alternative future use. In each case, we evaluate if the license agreement\nresults in the acquisition of an asset or a business. Such licenses purchased by us require substantial completion of research and development, regulatory and\nmarketing approval efforts in order to reach commercial feasibility and has no alternative future use. Accordingly, the total purchase price for the licenses\nacquired during the period was reflected as research and development - licenses acquired on the Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,\n2023, and 2022.\nAccrued Research and Development Expense\nWe record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing development within accrued expenses which are significant\ncomponents of research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service\nproviders. We accrue the costs incurred under agreements with these third parties based on estimates of actual work completed in accordance with the respective\nagreements. We determine the estimated costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress, or stage of\ncompletion or actual timeline (start-date and end-date) of the services and the agreed-upon fees to be paid for such services. Payments made to third parties\nunder these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.\nIf the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust accrued expenses or prepaid expenses accordingly,\nwhich impact research and development expenses. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our\nunderstanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting\namounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n68\nTable of Contents\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are a “smaller reporting company,” meaning that the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million and our annual revenue was\nless than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our\nshares held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and\nthe market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we may choose to present only the two most\nrecent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K , have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation,\nand smaller reporting companies are permitted to delay adoption of certain recent accounting pronouncements discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial\nstatements located in “Part IV, Item 15., Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” in this Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023, and 2022\nFor the year ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 $ %\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 40,513 $ 62,475 $ (21,962) (35)%\nResearch and development – licenses acquired 527 1,474 (947) (64)%\nGain on sale of property and equipment (1,466) — (1,466) 100%\nGeneral and administrative 9,686 12,210 (2,524) (21)%\nTotal operating expenses 49,260 76,159 (26,899) (35)%\nLoss from operations (49,260) (76,159) 26,899 (35)%\nOther income (expense)\nOther income 917 1,304 (387) (30)%\nInterest income 850 689 161 23%\nInterest expense (4,109) (3,359) (750) 22%\nTotal other income (expense) (2,342) (1,366) (976) 71%\nNet Loss $ (51,602) $ (77,525) $ 25,923 (33)%\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related expenses, stock-based\ncompensation, payments made to third parties for license, sponsored research and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and technology, payments\nmade to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical trials, consultants, the cost of\nmanufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings and laboratory service costs.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by approximately $22.0 million from $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $40.5 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to the\nfollowing:\n● $7.7 million decreased research and development employee compensation costs, including stock compensation, which includes approximately $3.4\nmillion of costs reimbursed through the subcontracting agreement with uBriGene;\n● $8.2 million decreased laboratory supply costs, including vector manufacturing costs, which includes approximately $0.9 million of costs reimbursed\nthrough the subcontracting agreement with uBriGene;\n● $6.7 million decreased for program related costs, which primarily reflects the reduction of spend on the discontinued programs;\n● $2.9 million decreased other costs including facility related costs, depreciation, consulting; and\n● offset by approximately $3.5 million for increase costs for services provided by uBriGene.\n69\nTable of Contents\nResearch and development expenses - licenses acquired decreased by $0.9 million from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $0.5 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses - licenses acquired for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflects\napproximately $0.6 million decrease for the annual stock dividend to Fortress, and $0.3 million decrease in milestone payments related to our licenses with\nCOH in the prior year.\nThe following table provides a breakout of the components of research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nR&D program related expenses (1)\nMB-102 $ (290) $ 1,269\nMB-106 4,727 3,953\nMB-107/207 (778) 1,588\nMB-109 1,140 1,511\nMB-110 350 505\nMayo in situ CAR T 594 994\nAll others (2) 672 3,339\nTotal R&D development expense 6,415 13,159\nR&D personnel related expenses 12,835 20,494\nR&D facility and depreciation expense 2,765 3,777\nR&D consulting expenses 3,286 4,312\nR&D lab supplies 8,267 16,438\nR&D other expense (3) 6,945 4,295\nTotal research and development expense $ 40,513 $ 62,475\n(1) Includes sponsored research, license and clinical trial related costs\n(2) Includes the costs for long-term follow-up and programs that were terminated.\n(3) Includes services provided by uBriGene under the manufacturing services agreement.\n(4) Credits reflect the termination of the programs and refunds from vendors.\nOur research and development expenses may vary significantly from period to period depending on where we are in the development plans for our various\nprograms, and the resources we have at the time to commit to those programs. The more significant costs impacting the level of expense include:\n● employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits;\n● license fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology;\n● expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and our preclinical activities;\n● costs associated with non-clinical activities, and regulatory approvals.\nGain on the Sale of Property and Equipment\nGain on the sale of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2023, is attributable to the difference between the base proceeds of $6.0 million\nreceived upon the closing of the uBriGene transaction and the relative fair value of the fixed assets sold.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for executives and other\nadministrative personnel, recruitment expenses, professional fees and other corporate expenses, including investor relations, legal activities including patent\nfees, and facilities-related expenses.\n70\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased by approximately $2.5 million from $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, to $9.7 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to the\nfollowing:\n● $0.3 million decreased general and administrative employee compensation costs, including stock based;\n● $0.7 million decreased third-party consulting;\n● $0.6 million decreased outside services, including recruiting fees;\n● $0.8 million decreased expense related to equity fees to Fortress,\n● $0.5 million decreased other costs, including business insurance and the Management Services Agreement with Fortress; and\n● offset by $0.4 million increased professional services.\nOur general and administrative expenses may vary significantly from period to period depending on the level of effort required to support our research and\ndevelopment group and our ongoing requirements of being a publicly traded company. The more significant costs contributing to our general and administrative\nexpenses include the following:\n● support of our research and development activities, including potential product candidates entering the clinic;\n● stock compensation granted to key employees and non-employees;\n● support of business development activities; and\n● professional fees and other costs associated with the regulatory requirements and increased compliance associated with being a publicly traded\ncompany.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of funds received from the NIH grant, interest income earned on cash balances and interest expense on our Term\nLoan. For the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, total other expense was approximately $2.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The $1.0 million\nincrease in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to increased interest expense of $0.8 million, which reflects $2.8\nmillion loss on the extinguishment of debt offset by $2.0 million decrease in interest expense related to the repayment of the Term Loan, $0.4 million decrease\nin other income reflecting the end of the NIH grant in August 2023, partially offset by $0.2 million increase in interest income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses and expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become\nprofitable. As of December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $381.0 million.\nWe have funded our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and our Term Loan. On April 11, 2023, we repaid the Term Loan, see Note 8 to the\nFinancial Statements.\nSources of Liquidity\nRegistration Statements\nOn December 12, 2023, we filed registration statement No. 333-275997 on Form S-1, which registered the offer and sale of common stock on behalf of the\nSelling Stockholders, of up to 2,743,530 shares of our common stock, issuable upon the exercise of certain warrants held by the Selling Stockholders.\n71\nTable of Contents\nOn October 23, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement No. 333-249657 on Form S-3 (the “2020 S-3”), which was declared effective on December 4, 2020.\nUnder the 2020 S-3, we may sell up to a total of $100.0 million of our securities. The 2020 S-3 expired on October 23, 2023.\nOn April 23, 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement No. 333-255476 on Form S-3 (the “2021 S-3”), which was declared effective on May 24, 2021. Under\nthe 2021 S-3, we may sell up to a total of $200.0 million of our securities. As of December 31, 2023, approximately $195.6 million of the 2021 S-3 remains\navailable for sale of securities.\nThe amount of securities we are able to sell pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-3 is limited. See “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nTerm Loan\nOn April 11, 2023, our long-term debt facility with Runway Growth Finance Corp. (the “Term Loan”) was terminated upon receipt by Runway of a payoff\namount of $30.4 million from us comprising principal, interest and the applicable final payment amount. The loss on extinguishment was recorded in interest\nexpense in the Statements of Operations.\nRegistered Direct Offering\nOn October 26, 2023, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with a single institutional accredited investor (the\n“Investor”) pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the\n“Registered Offering”), (i) 920,000 shares of common stock, at a price per share of $1.70 and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-funded Warrants”) to purchase\nup to 1,668,236 shares of our common stock, at a price per Pre-funded Warrant equal to $1.699, the price per share, less $0.001.\nThe Pre-funded Warrants were sold, in lieu of shares of common stock, to the Investor whose purchase of shares of common stock in the Registered Offering\nwould otherwise result in such Investor, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% (or, at such Investor’s option\nupon issuance, 9.99%) of our outstanding common stock immediately following the consumption of the Registered Offering. The Pre-funded Warrants have an\nexercise price of $0.001 per share, became exercisable upon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full.\nThe Registered Offering closed on October 30, 2023. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Registered Offering for general corporate purposes and\nworking capital requirements, which may include, among other things, the advancement of our product candidates to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA.\nIn a concurrent private placement, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we also agreed to issue and sell unregistered warrants (the “Warrants”) to\npurchase up to 2,588,236 shares of Common Stock, at an offering price of $0.125 per Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the “Private Placement”\nand, together with the Registered Offering, the “Registered Direct Offering”) (which offering price is included in the purchase price per Share or Pre-funded\nwarrant). The Warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share (subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Warrants), are exercisable upon issuance\nand will expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance. The Warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including for\nshare splits, share dividends, rights offering and pro rata distributions.\nThe Private Placement also closed on October 30, 2023, concurrently with the Registered Offering. We received approximately $4.4 million in gross proceeds\nfrom the Offerings, before deducting placement agency fees and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million.\nPursuant to the Founders Agreement, we did not issue any shares of common stock to Fortress for the year ended December 31, 2023, and recorded the value of\n64,706 shares issuable to Fortress in connection with the shares issued under the Registered Direct Offering.\nAt-the-Market Offering\nIn July 2018, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Mustang ATM”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (formerly B. Riley FBR, Inc.),\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co., National Securities Corporation (now B. Riley FBR, Inc.), and Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. (each an “Agent” and collectively, the\n“Agents”), relating to the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 S-3. Under the Mustang ATM, we pay the Agents a commission rate of up\nto 3.0% of the gross proceeds from the sale of any shares of common stock. On December\n72\nTable of Contents\n31, 2020, the Mustang ATM was amended to add H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC as an Agent. On April 14, 2023, the Mustang ATM was amended to add the\nlimitations imposed by General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 and remove Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. as an Agent.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued approximately 52,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $3.15 per share for gross proceeds\nof $163,000 under the ATM Agreement. In connection with these sales, we paid aggregate fees of approximately $3,000 for net proceeds of approximately\n$160,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued approximately 0.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $12.61 per share for gross\nproceeds of $6.6 million under the ATM Agreement. In connection with these sales, we paid aggregate fees of approximately $0.1 million for net proceeds of\napproximately $6.5 million.\nPursuant to the Founders Agreement, we did not issue any shares of common stock to Fortress for the year ended December 31, 2023, and recorded the value\nof 1,297 shares issuable to Fortress in connection with the shares issued under the Mustang ATM. Pursuant to the Founders Agreement, we issued 13,131 shares\nof common stock to Fortress at a weighted average price of $13.56 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the shares issued under\nthe Mustang ATM.\nThe number of securities we are able to sell pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-3 is limited. See “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nStatement of cash flows data:\nTotal cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (49,477) $ (65,066)\nInvesting activities 5,886 (2,952)\nFinancing activities (26,081) 34,056\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (69,672) $ (33,962)\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $65.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to approximately $51.6 million in net loss,\n$3.0 million change in operating assets and liabilities, and $1.5 million gain on the sale of property and equipment, partially offset by $1.9 million of\ndepreciation expense, $0.6 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, $0.5 million of common shares issuable in connection with our Founders\nAgreement, $0.1 million equity fee to Fortress related to Mustang ATM and the Registered Direct Offering, $0.1 million of amortization of debt discount, $2.8\nmillion loss on extinguishment of debt due to the repayment of the Term Loan, $0.4 million of amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets, and $0.2\nmillion gain on lease modification.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due to approximately $77.5 million in net loss, partially offset by\n$4.0 million change in operating assets and liabilities, $2.7 million of depreciation expense, $2.3 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, $1.1 million\nof common shares issuable for the Founders Agreement, $0.7 million equity fee to Fortress related to the Term Loan, $0.5 million of amortization of debt\ndiscount, $0.4 million of research and development-licenses acquired, $0.2 million loss on disposal of property and equipment, $0.3 million of amortization of\noperating lease right-of-use assets, and $0.2 million of equity fee on issuance of common shares to Fortress.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, representing $6.0 million of proceeds from the sale of\nproperty and equipment offset by $0.1 million used in purchases of research and development licenses and fixed assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing $2.7 million in purchases of fixed assets and $0.4\nmillion in purchases of research and development licenses, offset by $0.1 million of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.\n73\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $26.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by repayment of the Term Loan of $30.4 million offset\nby $4.4 million of gross proceeds from the Registered Direct Offering, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, $0.2 million of gross proceeds from the Mustang\nATM and $0.2 million raised from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”).\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $34.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by (i) proceeds from the issuance of the Term\nLoan of $30.0 million, net of financing costs of $2.7 million; (ii) gross proceeds of $6.6 million, net of offering costs of $0.1 million, from the Mustang ATM;\nand (iii) $0.2 million raised from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our ESPP.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.2 million. Based on our current operating plan, we currently expect that such cash and cash\nequivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations and clinical trials through the first quarter of 2024. In the near term, our liquidity and capital resources will\nbe significantly affected by our ability to raise additional equity capital, including receiving the Contingent Payment pursuant to the Amended Asset Purchase\nAgreement in connection with the sale of our Facility, as described under “Recent Developments” above. Receipt of the Contingent Payment is dependent upon\nour raising an additional $5.4 million through issuances of equity securities in order to complete the Contingent Capital Raise and obtaining the Landlord’s\nconsent to the Proposed Lease transfer. The lease transfer is subject to review and approval by CFIUS. The current 45-day review period will conclude no later\nthan March 28, 2024. If we are not able to secure the Contingent Payment by the end of the first quarter of 2024, we will continue to seek addition funding\nthrough corporate partnerships and capital markets fundraising and may face significant difficulty in funding our operations in the short term and will need to\npursue other options to reduce expenses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements.”\nThe continuation of our business as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional capital and eventually attaining and maintaining profitable operations.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these\nfinancial statements. The financial statements included in this Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should operations discontinue.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, our public float was less than $75 million. As a result, we are subject to the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-\n3 until such time as our public float exceeds $75 million, which means we only have the capacity to sell shares up to one-third of our public float under shelf\nregistration statements in any twelve-month period. If our public float decreases, the number of securities we may sell under our Form S-3 shelf registration\nstatements will also decrease. We will remain constrained by the limitations of General Instruction I.B.6 to Form S-3 until such time as our public float exceeds\n$75 million, at which time the number of securities we may sell under a Form S-3 registration statement will no longer be limited by limitations of General\nInstruction I.B.6 to Form S-3.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with licensors, CROs, contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) and other third parties for the\nprocurement of various products and services, including without limitation biopharmaceutical development, biologic assay development, commercialization,\nclinical and preclinical development, clinical trials management, pharmacovigilance and manufacturing and supply. These contracts typically do not contain\nminimum purchase commitments (although they may) and are generally terminable by us upon written notice. Payments due upon termination or\ncancelation/delay consist of payments for services provided or expenses incurred, including non-cancelable obligations of our service providers, up to the date\nof cancellation; in certain cases, our contractual arrangements with CROs and CMOs include cancelation and/or delay fees and penalties.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nNone.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they\nwill meet their objectives. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of December 31, 2023, of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as\nsuch term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\nhave concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our\nExchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such\ninformation is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act\nRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer, and effected by our Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes\nthose policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with\nauthorization of our management and directors; and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use or disposition of our assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and\ncompliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be\ncircumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process.\nTherefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making the assessment, management\nused the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013).\nBased on our assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective based\nupon those criteria.\n75\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C.

Currently, we have six directors.\nThe Board does not have a formal policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, as the Board believes that\nit is in the best interests of the Company to make that determination based on the direction of the Company and the current membership of the Board. The\nBoard has determined that having a director who is also the Chief Executive Officer serve as the Chairman is not in the best interest of the Company’s\nstockholders at this time.\nDuring 2023, our Board held eleven meetings. During 2023, each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the meetings of those\ncommittees on which each director served, in each case during the period that such person was a director. The permanent committees established by our Board\nare the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, descriptions of which are set forth in more detail below. Our directors are expected to attend each\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders.\nDirector Independence\nWe adhere to the corporate governance standards adopted by The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). Nasdaq rules require our Board to make an\naffirmative determination as to the independence of each director. Consistent with these rules, our Board completed its annual review of director independence\nand considered relationships and transactions during 2023 between each director or any member of his immediate family, on the one hand, and the Company\nand our subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand. The purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions were\ninconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. Based on this review, our Board determined that Adam Chill, Neil Herskowitz, and Michael\nZelefsky, M.D. are independent under the criteria established by Nasdaq and our Board.\nFortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress”) beneficially owns capital stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock eligible to\nvote in the election of directors. As a result, we qualify as a “controlled company” and avail ourselves of certain “controlled company” exemptions under the\nNasdaq corporate governance rules. As a controlled company, we are not required to have a majority of “independent directors” on our Board as defined under\nthe Nasdaq rules, or have a compensation, nominating or governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. Despite qualifying as a controlled\ncompany, we have a separately constituted Compensation Committee consisting entirely of independent directors.\nBoard Committees\nThe permanent committees established by our Board are the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, descriptions of which are set forth in more\ndetail below.\n78\nTable of Contents\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee currently consists of Adam J. Chill, Neil Herskowitz, and Michael J. Zelefsky, M.D. Mr. Chill chairs the Audit Committee.\nThe Audit Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth\nin the Charter of the Audit Committee which was recently reviewed by our Audit Committee.

Among other things, the duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee include reviewing and monitoring our\nfinancial statements and internal accounting procedures, the selection of, consultation with and review of the services provided by our independent registered\npublic accounting and identifying and assessing any related party transactions in collaboration with counsel, accountants and management. Our Audit\nCommittee has sole discretion over the retention, compensation, evaluation and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe SEC and Nasdaq have established rules and regulations regarding the composition of audit committees and the qualifications of audit committee members.\nOur Board has examined the composition of our Audit Committee and the qualifications of our Audit Committee members in light of the current rules and\nregulations governing audit committees. Based upon this examination, our Board has determined that each member of our Audit Committee is independent and\nis otherwise qualified to be a member of our Audit Committee in accordance with the rules of the SEC and Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, the SEC requires that at least one member of the Audit Committee have a “heightened” level of financial and accounting sophistication. Such a\nperson is known as the “audit committee financial expert” under the SEC’s rules. Our Board has determined that Mr. Chill is an “audit committee financial\nexpert,” as the SEC defines that term, and is an independent member of our Board and our Audit Committee. Please see Mr. Chill’s biography in Item 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee currently consists of Adam J. Chill, Neil Herskowitz and Michael J. Zelefsky, M.D. Mr. Herskowitz chairs the Compensation\nCommittee.\nThe Compensation Committee held two meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The duties and responsibilities of the Compensation\nCommittee are set forth in the Charter of the Compensation Committee which was recently reviewed by our Compensation Committee. A copy of the Charter\nof the Compensation Committee is available on our website, located at ir.mustangbio.com. As discussed in its Charter, among other things, the duties and\nresponsibilities of the Compensation Committee include approving any corporate goals and objectives relating to the compensation of our executive officers,\nevaluating the performance of our executive officers, and administering all of our executive compensation programs, including, but not limited to, our incentive\nand equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of all of our executive officers on an annual basis and reviews and approves\non an annual basis all compensation programs and awards relating to such officers. The Compensation Committee applies discretion in the determination of\nindividual executive compensation packages to ensure compliance with our compensation philosophy. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to\nthe Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation packages for officers other than himself.\nNasdaq has established rules and regulations regarding the composition of compensation committees and the qualifications of compensation committee\nmembers. Our Board has examined the composition of our Compensation Committee and the qualifications of our Compensation Committee members in light\nof the current rules and regulations governing compensation committees. Based upon this examination, our Board of Directors has determined that each\nmember of our Compensation Committee is independent and is otherwise qualified to be a member of our Compensation Committee in accordance with such\nrules.\nNominating Process\nWe do not currently have a nominating committee or any other committee serving a similar function. Although we do not have a written charter in place to\nselect director nominees, our Board has adopted resolutions regarding the director nomination process. We believe that the current process in place functions\neffectively to select director nominees who will be valuable members of our Board.\nWe identify potential nominees to serve as directors through a variety of business contacts, including current executive officers, directors, community leaders\nand stockholders. We may, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Board, retain a professional search firm and other advisors to identify potential nominees.\nWe will also consider candidates recommended by stockholders for nomination to our Board. A stockholder who wishes to recommend a candidate for\nnomination to our Board must submit such recommendation to our Interim Chief Financial Officer, James Murphy, at our\n79\nTable of Contents\noffices located at 377 Plantation Street, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605. Any recommendation must be received not less than 50 calendar days nor more than\n90 calendar days before the anniversary date of the previous year’s annual meeting.\nOn April 7, 2017, we entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with Dr. Litchman, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to use our best\nefforts to cause Dr. Litchman to be nominated and reelected to the Board. Except as described herein, there are no arrangements or understandings between any\nof our executive officers or directors and any other person pursuant to which any of them are elected as an officer or director.\nWe believe that our Board as a whole should encompass a range of talent, skill, and expertise enabling it to provide sound guidance with respect to our\noperations and interests. Our independent directors evaluate all candidates to our Board by reviewing their biographical information and qualifications. If the\ndirectors determine that a candidate is qualified to serve on our Board, such candidate is interviewed by at least one of the directors and our Chief Executive\nOfficer. Other members of the Board also have an opportunity to interview qualified candidates. The directors then determine, based on the background\ninformation and the information obtained in the interviews, whether to recommend to the Board that the candidate be nominated for approval by the\nstockholders to fill a directorship. With respect to an incumbent director whom the directors are considering as a potential nominee for re-election, the directors\nreview and consider the incumbent director’s service during his or her term, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, and overall\ncontribution to the Board. The manner in which the directors evaluate a potential nominee will not differ based on whether the candidate is recommended by\nour directors or stockholders.\nWe consider the following qualifications, among others, when making a determination as to whether a person should be nominated to our Board: the\nindependence of the director nominee; the nominee’s character and integrity; financial literacy; level of education and business experience, including experience\nrelating to biopharmaceutical companies; whether the nominee has sufficient time to devote to our Board; and the nominee’s commitment to represent the long-\nterm interests of our stockholders. We review candidates in the context of the current composition of the Board and the evolving needs of our business. We\nbelieve that each of the current members of our Board has the requisite business, biopharmaceutical, financial or managerial experience to serve as a member of\nthe Board, as described above in their biographies under the heading “Information about our Executive Officers” and “Information about our Non-Employee\nDirectors.” We also believe that each of the current members of our Board has other key attributes that are important to an effective board, including integrity,\nhigh ethical standards, sound judgment, analytical skills, and the commitment to devote significant time and energy to service on the Board and its committees.\nWe are not currently in compliance with Nasdaq’s Board Diversity Rule, as we do not have a “Diverse Director” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules. We evaluate all\nqualified candidates to serve on our Board, including those with diverse backgrounds, and will continue to do so in furtherance of efforts to gain compliance\nwith Nasdaq’s Board Diversity Rule.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Ethics (the “Code”), which applies to all of our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer.

The amount shown represents fees and expenses payable to Danforth in connection with the Chief Financial Officer services provided by Mr. Lurier\nbased on a negotiated hourly rate. On December 8, 2023, Mr. Lurier passed away unexpectedly.\nNarrative to Summary Compensation Table\nEmployment Agreements\nDr. Litchman\nIn April 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Litchman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which he received an initial\nannual base salary of $395,000. As part of his annual review in January 2023, the Board increased Dr. Litchman’s annual base salary to $485,500 effective as of\nApril 1, 2023. The employment agreement further provides eligibility for an incentive bonus linked to the realization of certain corporate milestones to be\nestablished annually by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Dr. Litchman’s target annual bonus is equal to fifty percent (50%) of his annual salary, and\nthe Board or the Compensation Committee will determine the actual payout amount each year. Dr. Litchman’s annual bonus for 2023 is described under\n“Annual Incentive Bonus” below. The employment agreement provides that if we terminate Dr. Litchman without cause or if he resigns for good reason, as\nthose terms are defined in the employment agreement, he will be entitled to: (i) severance payments at a rate equal to his base salary then in effect for a period\nof 12 months following his termination date; (ii) a pro-rata share of the annual incentive bonus for the year in which the termination occurred, to be paid when\nand if such bonus would have been paid under the employment agreement; (iii) accelerated partial vesting of all unvested time-based equity awards with respect\nto the same number of shares that would have vested if Dr. Litchman had continued in employment for one year following the termination date; and (iv) if Dr.\nLitchman timely elects continued health insurance coverage under COBRA, the entire premium necessary to continue such coverage for Dr. Litchman and Dr.\nLitchman’s eligible dependents until the conclusion of the time when Dr. Litchman is receiving continuation of base salary payments or until Dr. Litchman\nbecomes eligible for group health insurance coverage under another employer’s plan, whichever occurs first, provided however that we have the right to\nterminate\n81\nTable of Contents\nsuch payment of COBRA premiums on behalf of Dr. Litchman and instead pay him a lump sum amount equal to the COBRA premium times the number of\nmonths remaining in the specified period if we determine in our discretion that continued payment of COBRA premiums is or may be discriminatory under\nSection 105(h) of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, if Dr. Litchman is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within twelve months\nfollowing a change in control, he will be entitled to the severance benefits described in (i), (ii) and (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence, as well as 100%\naccelerated vesting of the options and other equity awards granted to him. In the event Dr. Litchman’s employment is terminated due to his death or disability,\nhe or his estate will receive continuing salary payments for ninety days and a pro-rata share of the annual incentive bonus for the year in which the termination\noccurred, to be paid when and if such bonus would have been paid under the employment agreement. In each case, the severance benefits are conditioned upon\nDr. Litchman’s execution and non-revocation of a release of claims against us and compliance with certain non-solicitation and non-competition covenants\nduring his employment and for a period of six months thereafter. Also, the severance benefits are subject to reduction to avoid the imposition of excise taxes\nunder Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, provided that such reduction would result in a better after-tax result for Dr. Litchman.\nMr. Lurier\nMr. Lurier provided consulting services to us pursuant to a consulting agreement between us and Danforth Advisors, LLC and received no compensation\ndirectly from us.\nAnnual Cash Incentive Bonus\nIn 2023, Dr. Litchman was eligible to earn a target annual cash incentive equal to 50% of his base salary per the terms of his Employment Agreement.\nDr. Litchman’s annual cash incentive bonus is based upon our performance against pre-established corporate goals and objectives, which included a\ncombination of clinical and nonclinical goals related to our products (weighted at an aggregate of 90% of the target awards) as well as other corporate\ndevelopment goals (weighted at 10% of the target awards), and his individual performance based upon subjective performance reviews. Our corporate goals\nwere achieved at an aggregate level of 96% reflecting the successful achievement of clinical, nonclinical, and corporate development goals. As of March 11,\n2024, Dr. Litchman’s annual cash incentive bonus has not yet been approved by the Compensation Committee. The actual amounts paid to Dr. Litchman\npursuant to his annual cash incentive award is reported in the “Summary Compensation Table” as non-equity incentive plan compensation.\nEquity Awards\nThe Compensation Committee has granted Dr. Litchman equity awards under our Mustang Bio, Inc. 2016 Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”).

Under the Clawback\nPolicy, in the event that financial results upon which a cash or equity-based incentive award was based becomes the subject of a financial restatement that is\nrequired because of material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, the Compensation Committee will conduct a review of awards covered by\nthe Clawback Policy and recoup any erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation to ensure that the ultimate award reflects the financial results as\nrestated. The Clawback Policy covers any cash or equity-based incentive compensation award that was paid, earned or granted to covered executive officers\nduring the last completed three fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which we are required to prepare the accounting restatement.\nDirector Compensation\nDirectors who are also employees are not compensated separately for serving on the Board or any of its committees. Each of our non-employee directors\nreceives cash compensation for his or her services. The Compensation Committee periodically conducts reviews of peer company director compensation\npractices, including before considering changes to our director compensation program and amounts. In addition, to better align the interests of our Board with\nour stockholders, the Compensation Committee considers and recommends to the Board long-term equity compensation.\nDirector Compensation Program\nIn January 2016, the Board adopted a Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan for our non-employee directors, which determines the cash and equity\ncompensation payable to our non-employee directors.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nSince January 1, 2022, we have not been a party to any transaction in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our\ndirectors, NEOs, or beneficial owners of more than 5% of our capital stock, or an affiliate or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or\nindirect material interest, and other than compensation, termination, and change-in-control arrangements.\nThe written charter of the Audit Committee authorizes, and Nasdaq rules require, the Audit Committee to review and approve related-party transactions. In\nreviewing related-party transactions, the Audit Committee applies the basic standard that transactions with affiliates should be made on terms no less favorable\nto us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties. Therefore, the Audit Committee reviews the benefits of the transactions, terms of the transactions\nand the terms available from unrelated third parties, as applicable. All transactions other than compensatory arrangements between us and our officers,\ndirectors, principal stockholders and their affiliates will be approved by the Audit Committee or a majority of the disinterested directors and will continue to be\non terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties.\nFounders Agreement and Management Services Agreement with Fortress\nEffective March 13, 2015, we entered a Founders Agreement with Fortress, which was amended and restated on May 17, 2016, and again on July 26, 2016 (the\n“Mustang Founders Agreement”). The Mustang Founders Agreement provides that, in exchange for the time and capital expended in the formation of our\ncompany and the identification of specific assets the acquisition of which result in the formation of a viable emerging growth life science company, Fortress\nloaned $2.0 million, representing the up-front fee required to acquire our license agreement with COH. The Mustang Founders Agreement has a term of 15\nyears, which upon expiration automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by Fortress and the Company or a Change in Control (as\ndefined in the Mustang Founders Agreement) occurs. Concurrently with the second amendment on July 26, 2016, to the Mustang Founders Agreement, Fortress\nentered into an Exchange Agreement whereby Fortress exchanged its 7.25 million Class B Common shares for 466,667 common shares and 250,000 Class A\nPreferred\n86\nTable of Contents\nshares. Class A Preferred Stock is identical to common stock other than as to voting rights, conversion rights and the Annual Stock Dividend right (as described\nbelow). Each share of Class A Preferred Stock is entitled to vote the number of votes that is equal to one and one-tenth (1.1) times a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the sum of (A) the shares of our outstanding common stock and (B) the whole shares of our common stock into which the shares of outstanding\nClass A common stock and Class A Preferred Stock are convertible and the denominator of which is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred\nStock. Thus, the Class A Preferred Stock will at all times constitute a voting majority. Each share of Class A Preferred Stock is convertible, at Fortress’ option,\ninto one fully paid and nonassessable share of our common stock, subject to certain adjustments. As holders of Class A Preferred Stock, Fortress will receive on\neach January 1 (each a “Annual Stock Dividend Payment Date”) until the date all outstanding Class A Preferred Stock is converted into common stock, pro rata\nper share dividends paid in additional fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock (“Annual Stock Dividends”) such that the aggregate number of\nshares of common stock issued pursuant to such Annual Stock Dividend is equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of our fully-diluted outstanding\ncapitalization on the date that is one (1) business day prior to any Annual Stock Dividend Payment Date.\nAs additional consideration under the Mustang Founders Agreement, we are required to: (i) pay an equity fee in shares of common stock, payable within five\n(5) business days of the closing of any equity or debt financing that occurs after the effective date of the Mustang Founders Agreement and ending on the date\nwhen Fortress no longer has majority voting control in our voting equity, equal to two and one-half (2.5%) of the gross amount of any such equity or debt\nfinancing; and (ii) pay a cash fee equal to four and one-half percent (4.5%) of our annual net sales, payable on an annual basis, within ninety (90) days of the\nend of each calendar year. In the event of a Change in Control, we will pay a one-time change in control fee equal to five (5x) times the product of (A) net sales\nfor the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the change in control and (B) four and one-half percent (4.5%).\nEffective as of March 13, 2015, we entered into a Management Services Agreement (the “MSA”) with Fortress, pursuant to which Fortress renders advisory and\nconsulting services to us. The MSA has an initial term of five years and is automatically renewed for successive five-year terms unless terminated in accordance\nwith its provisions. Services provided under the MSA may include, without limitation, (i) advice and assistance concerning any and all aspects of our\noperations, clinical trials, financial planning and strategic transactions and financings and (ii) conducting relations on our behalf with accountants, attorneys,\nfinancial advisors and other professionals (collectively, the “Services”). We are obligated to utilize clinical research services, medical education, communication\nand marketing services and investor relations/public relation services of companies or individuals designated by Fortress, provided those services are offered at\nmarket prices. However, we are not obligated to take or act upon any advice rendered from Fortress and Fortress shall not be liable for any of its actions or\ninactions based upon their advice. Pursuant to the MSA and our Certificate of Incorporation, Fortress and its affiliates, including all members of our Board, will\nhave no fiduciary or other duty to communicate or present any corporate opportunities to us or to refrain from engaging in business that is similar to that of our\ncompany. In consideration for the Services, we pay Fortress an annual consulting fee of $0.5 million (the “Annual Consulting Fee”), payable in advance in\nequal quarterly installments on the first business day of each calendar quarter in each year, provided, however, that such Annual Consulting Fee shall be\nincreased to $1.0 million for each calendar year in which we have net assets in excess of $100 million at the beginning of the calendar year. We record fifty\npercent of the Annual Consulting Fee in research and development expense and fifty percent in general and administrative expense in the Statement of\nOperations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded expense of $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, related to this agreement.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we issued zero shares of common stock and recorded 66,003 shares issuable to Fortress, which equaled 2.5% of the\ngross proceeds of $0.2 million from the sale of shares of common stock under our At-the-Market Offering and $4.4 million gross proceeds on the Registered\nDirect Offering. We recorded an expense of approximately $0.1 million in general and administrative expenses related to these shares for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we issued 13,131 shares of common stock and recorded zero shares issuable to Fortress, which equaled 2.5% of the\ngross proceeds of $6.6 million from the sale of shares of common stock under the Mustang ATM. We recorded an expense of approximately $0.2 million in\ngeneral and administrative expenses related to these shares for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nPayables and Accrued Expenses Related Party\nIn the normal course of business Fortress pays for certain expenses on our behalf.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $100,000 in expense in our\nStatements of Operations related to the director compensation, including approximately $50,000 in expense related to equity incentive grants.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations,\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and\nits cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nfinancial statements, the Company’s expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future, and the need for additional funding\nto support its planned operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also\ndescribed in Note 1. The financial statements and supplemental information do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this\nuncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based\non our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the transaction with uBriGene\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, during 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and related amendments with\nuBriGene Biosciences, Inc. (uBriGene), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to sell its leasehold interest in its cell processing facility and associated\nassets relating to the production of cell and gene therapies to uBriGene. The Company received proceeds of $6.0 million, which it allocated to the\nindividual sold assets on a relative fair value basis. The Company recognized a gain of $1.5 million and recorded $0.2 million of the consideration as\ndeferred income of in its 2023 financial statement. The transaction requires governmental and lessor approval before the lease interest can be transferred to\nuBriGene. The Company will recognize the\nF-2\nTable of Contents\ndeferred income and will receive additional proceeds from uBriGene totaling $5.0 million, if the Company, within two years from the closing date, (i)\ncompletes an issuance of equity securities in an amount equal to or greater than $10.0 million and (ii) obtains consent of the landlord to the proposed lease\ntransfer.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s accounting for the transaction with uBriGene as a critical audit matter. Specifically, challenging and\ncomplex auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required in identifying the elements of the transaction, including those that were\ndelivered in 2023 and those that were yet to be delivered, and evaluating the application of the relevant accounting guidance.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We inspected the Company’s accounting analysis for the\ntransaction. We compared management’s assessment of the elements of the transaction delivered and those that were yet to be delivered to supporting\ndocumentation. We involved professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n● inspecting the underlying agreements to understand the relevant terms and conditions and identify the elements of the transaction\n● evaluating whether the Company’s accounting for the transaction is in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 11, 2024\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nMUSTANG BIO, INC.\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except for share and per share amounts)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 6,234 $ 75,656\nOther receivables -

Organization and Description of Business\nMustang Bio, Inc. (the “Company” or “Mustang”) was incorporated in Delaware on March 13, 2015. Mustang is as a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell and gene therapy into potential cures for\nhematologic cancers, solid tumors and rare genetic diseases. The Company may acquire rights to these technologies by licensing the rights\nor otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the technologies, funding their research and development and eventually either out-\nlicensing or bringing the technologies to market.\nThe Company is a majority-controlled subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc. (“Fortress” or “Parent”).\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and trades under the symbol “MBIO.”\nReverse Stock Split\nOn March 3, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) unanimously adopted resolutions to approve and recommend\nstockholder approval of a form amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a\nreverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock within a range of between 5-for-1 and 20-for-1 (with our Board being\nauthorized to determine the exact ratio), with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date before January 31, 2024, if at all,\nas determined by the Board in its sole discretion (such reverse stock split, the “Reverse Stock Split” and such amendment, the\n“Amendment”). On March 3, 2023, the holders of a majority in voting power of issued and outstanding shares of our Common Stock and\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 (together, the “Majority Holders”) approved the\nAmendment by written consent in lieu of a meeting (the “Written Consent”). On March 15, 2023, the Board selected the 15-for-1 reverse\nstock split ratio.\nPursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a Schedule\n14C information statement was filed with the SEC and provided to the stockholders of the Company. The Reverse Stock Split became\neffective on April 3, 2023, or twenty (20) days from the mailing of the information statement to the common stockholders of record.\nAll share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented, unless\notherwise indicated. Proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the\nexercise or vesting of all stock options, restricted stock and warrants outstanding at April 3, 2023, which resulted in a proportional decrease\nin the number of shares of the Company’s common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options, restricted\nstock and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportional increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and\nwarrants.\nNo fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split and stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction\nof one share received a proportional cash payment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company has incurred substantial operating losses and expects to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable\nfuture and may never become profitable. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $381.0 million.\nThe Company has funded its operations to date primarily through the sale of equity and via debt raises, which included its loan and\nfinancing agreement with Runway Growth Finance Corporation (the \"Lender\"), herein referred to as the \"Term Loan.\" On April 11, 2023,\nthe Company repaid the Term Loan, see Note 8. The Company expects to continue to use the proceeds from previous financing transactions\nprimarily for general corporate purposes, including financing the Company’s growth, developing new or existing product candidates, and\nfunding capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments.\nF-8\nTable of Contents\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with uBriGene (Boston)\nBiosciences, Inc. (“uBriGene”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell its leasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in\nWorcester, MA (the “Facility”) and associated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility\nto uBriGene. The Company and uBriGene subsequently entered into Amendment No. 1, dated as of June 29, 2023, and Amendment No. 2,\ndated as of July 28, 2023, to the Asset Purchase Agreement (the Asset Purchase Agreement, as so amended, the “Amended Asset Purchase\nAgreement”). On July 28, 2023, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed\nthe sale of all of the Company’s assets primarily relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies to uBriGene for a\nbase consideration of $6.0 million. uBriGene will be obligated to pay to the Company a contingent amount of $5.0 million less certain\nseverance obligations and payments payable in connection with the transfer of certain contracts related to the transferred assets, if the\nCompany, within two years of the closing date, (i) completes an issuance of equity securities in an amount equal to or greater than $10.0\nmillion after the closing and (ii) obtains consent of the landlord to the proposed lease transfer within two years of the closing date. As\ncontemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement, where the Company\ncontracted uBriGene to manufacture its lead product candidates, including MB-106, and it committed to spend at least $8.0 million over a\nperiod of two years after the closing of the transaction to purchase manufacturing and related services from uBriGene.\nOn October 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with a single institutional\naccredited investor (the “Investor”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-\nmarket under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Registered Offering”), (i) 920,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value\nper share, at a price per Share of $1.70 and (ii) pre-funded warrants (the “Pre-funded Warrants”) to purchase up to 1,668,236 shares of its\ncommon stock, at a price per Pre-funded Warrant equal to $1.699, the price per Share, less $0.001. The Pre-funded Warrants have an\nexercise price of $0.001 per share, became exercisable upon issuance and remain exercisable until exercised in full.\nIn a concurrent private placement, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company also agreed to issue and sell unregistered\nwarrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase up to 2,588,236 shares of Common Stock, at an offering price of $0.125 per Warrant to purchase one\nshare of common stock (the “Private Placement” and, together with the Registered Offering, the “Offerings”) (which offering price is\nincluded in the purchase price per Share or Pre-funded warrant). The Warrants have an exercise price of $1.58 per share (subject to\ncustomary adjustments as set forth in the Warrants), are exercisable upon issuance and will expire five and one-half years from the date of\nissuance. The Warrants contain customary anti-dilution adjustments to the exercise price, including for share splits, share dividends, rights\noffering and pro rata distributions.\nThe Registered Offering and Private Placement closed on October 30, 2023. The Company received approximately $4.4 million in gross\nproceeds from the Offerings, before deducting placement agency fees and offering expenses of approximately $0.5 million.\nThe Company will be required to expend significant funds in order to advance the development of its product candidates. The Company\nwill require additional financings through equity and debt offerings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources to fully\ndevelop, prepare regulatory filings, obtain regulatory approvals and commercialize its existing and any new product candidates. The\ncontinuation of our business as a going concern is dependent upon raising additional capital and eventually attaining and maintaining\nprofitable operations.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-40, Going Concern, the Company evaluated whether there are\nconditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one\nyear after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the\npotential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued.\nWhen substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently\nalleviates substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans,\nhowever, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the\nfinancial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that\nraise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these\nF-9\nTable of Contents\nconsolidated financial statements are issued. In performing its evaluation, management excluded elements of its operating plan that cannot\nbe considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future equity or debt issuances, and the potential\nsale of priority review vouchers cannot be considered probable at this time because these plans are not entirely within the Company’s\ncontrol nor have been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of these financial statements.\nThe Company's expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future, and the need for additional\nfunding to support its planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a\nperiod of one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company continues to monitor its spending by\nreducing 2024 expenses, which may include projected savings through delaying the development timelines of certain programs, or\ntermination of such programs and the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. The\nCompany has concluded that substantial doubt exists about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12\nmonths from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and\nsatisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the\nrecoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary if the\nCompany is unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”). The Company has no subsidiaries.\nAll inter-company transactions between Fortress and Mustang are classified as due from or due to related party in the financial statements.\nThe Company believes that the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete information is available for evaluation by the\nchief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The\nCompany views its operations and manages its business in one operating and reporting segment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and\ncash equivalents at December 31, 2023 and 2022, consisted of cash and certificates of deposit in institutions in the United States. The\nCompany maintains its cash and cash equivalent balances with high-quality financial institutions and, consequently, the Company believes\nthat such funds are currently adequately protected against credit risk. At times, portions of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents may\nbe uninsured or in deposit accounts that exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limits, though the Company customarily\ninvests a significant portion of its cash in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) accounts to maximize FDIC\ninsurance coverage across its holdings. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had not experienced losses on these accounts, and\nmanagement believes the Company is not exposed to significant risk on such accounts.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nOther Receivables – Related Party\nOther receivables include amounts due to the Company from Fortress and is recorded at the invoiced amount.\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company records cash held in an escrow account as a security deposit for the manufacturing facility in Worcester, Massachusetts, as\nrestricted cash. The Company had $0.8 million and $1.0 million in restricted cash as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nFacility initiated cell processing operations for personalized CAR T and gene therapies in 2018.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net, which consists primarily of leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation for leasehold improvements is computed over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases.\nDepreciation for all other property and equipment assets is recorded over the useful lives of the respective assets, generally five years,\nusing the straight-line method.\nProperty and equipment - Construction in Process\nIn connection with the Company’s Mercantile Street Facility, the Company incurred costs for the design and buildout of the office space of\n$29,000 recorded in fixed assets – construction in process on the Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023. The Company does not yet occupy\nthe Mercantile Street Facility. In connection with the Company’s Plantation Street Facility, the Company incurred costs for the design and\nconstruction of the facility and the purchase of equipment of $1.0 million recorded in fixed assets - construction in process on the Balance\nSheet at December 31, 2022. Upon completion of the facility’s buildout and the improvements being placed into service, the costs will be\nrecorded as leasehold improvements and amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research\nand development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the\npayment is made. Upfront and milestone payments due to third parties that perform research and development services on the Company’s\nbehalf will be expensed as services are rendered or when the milestone is achieved.\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of personnel related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel, and other related\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, payments made to third parties for license and milestone costs related to in-licensed products and\ntechnology, payments made to third party contract research organizations for preclinical and clinical studies, investigative sites for clinical\ntrials, consultants, the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials, costs associated with regulatory filings, laboratory costs\nand other supplies.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 730-10-25-1, Research and Development, costs incurred in obtaining\ntechnology licenses are charged to research and development expense if the technology licensed has not reached commercial feasibility and\nhas no alternative future use. The licenses purchased by the Company require substantial completion of research and development,\nregulatory and marketing approval efforts to reach commercial feasibility and has no alternative future use. Accordingly, the total purchase\nprice for the licenses acquired is reflected as research and development – licenses acquired in the Company’s Statements of Operations.\nAnnual Stock Dividend\nIn July 2016, in connection with the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company issued 250,000 Class A preferred\nshares to Fortress. The Class A preferred shares entitle the holder to a stock dividend equal to 2.5% of the fully diluted outstanding equity\nof the Company (the “Annual Stock Dividend”). The Annual Stock Dividend was part of the consideration payable for formation of the\nCompany and the identification of certain assets, including the license contributed to Mustang by Fortress (see Note 4).\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2018, in connection with the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company amended the Annual Stock Dividend\ndue date from March 13th to January 1st.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company issued 353,086 shares of common stock to Fortress for the\nAnnual Stock Dividend, representing 2.5% of the fully-diluted outstanding equity of Mustang on January 1, 2024.

The\nCompany recorded an expense of approximately $0.5 million in research and development – licenses acquired related to these issuable\nshares during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Company issued 187,134 shares of common stock to Fortress for the\nAnnual Stock Dividend, representing 2.5% of the fully-diluted outstanding equity of Mustang on January 1, 2023. The value of these shares\nis shown in the Statement of Stockholders’ Equity at December 31, 2022, as Common stock issuable – Annual Stock Dividend. The\nCompany recorded an expense of approximately $1.1 million in research and development – licenses acquired related to these issuable\nshares during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFair Value Measurement\nThe Company follows accounting guidance on fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Under the accounting guidance, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell\nan asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a\nmarket-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a\nliability.\nThe accounting guidance requires fair value measurements be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the\nmarketplace.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are\ndetermined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the\ndetermination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when\nmeasuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement\nin its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.\nLeases\nArrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the balance sheet as both\na right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or\nthe Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of\nuse asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset\nresult in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses are recorded when incurred. In calculating the right of use\nasset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company excludes short-term leases having\ninitial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the lease term.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company expenses stock-based compensation to employees over the requisite service period based on the estimated grant-date fair\nvalue of the awards and forfeiture rates.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model or 409a valuations, as\napplicable. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management’s best estimates and involve\ninherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the\nfuture tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities\nand their respective income tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company establishes a valuation allowance if\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered based on an evaluation of objective\nverifiable evidence. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the largest\namount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained\nupon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit.\nNet Loss per Share\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period less\nunvested restricted stock. Since dividends are declared, paid and set aside among the holders of shares of common stock and Class A\ncommon shares pro-rata on an as-if-converted basis, the two-class method of computing net loss per share is not required. Diluted net loss\nper share does not reflect the effect of shares of common stock to be issued upon the exercise of warrants or outstanding Class A preferred\nshares, as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities\nas having rights that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders. In addition, as our non-pre-funded warrants are\nparticipating securities, we are required to calculate diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method and utilize the most dilutive\nresult. In periods where there is a net loss, no allocation of undistributed net loss to non-pre-funded warrants is performed as the holders of\nour non-pre-funded warrants are not contractually obligated to participate in our losses.\nThe table below summarizes potentially dilutive securities that were not considered in the computation of diluted net loss per share because\nthey would be anti-dilutive.\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nWarrants(1) 2,813,632 70,195\nOptions 76,112 76,112\nClass A Preferred Shares 250,000 250,000\nUnvested restricted stock awards 64,706 34,016\nUnvested restricted stock units 95,197 165,912\nTotal 3,299,647 596,235\n(1) Excludes 1,668,236 pre-funded warrants. The shares underlying the pre-funded warrants are included in basic net loss per share.\nComprehensive Loss\nThe Company has no components of other comprehensive loss, and therefore, comprehensive loss equals net loss.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-06, Disclosure\nImprovements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Updated and Simplification Initiative, which amends the\ndisclosure or presentation requirements related to various subtopics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. ASU 2023-06 was\nissued in response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the “SEC”) August 2018 final rule that updated and simplified\ndisclosure requirements and is intended to align U.S. GAAP requirements with those of the SEC and to facilitate the application of U.S.\nGAAP for all entities. For entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements and for entities required to file or furnish financial\nstatements with or to the SEC in preparation for the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual\nrestrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC removes that related disclosure from its\nrules. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendments will be removed\nfrom the Codification and not become effective for any entity. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but we do not\nexpect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07,\n“Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments in ASU 2023-07 improve reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments introduce a new\nrequirement to disclose significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), extend certain\nannual disclosures to interim periods, clarify single reportable segment entities must apply ASC 280 in its entirety, permit more than one\nmeasure of segment profit or loss to be reported under certain conditions, and require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM.\nThis guidance is effective for fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. Early adoption will be permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its financial\nstatements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands\ndisclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and disclosures regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. The update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact\nthat this guidance will have on our financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 3 - License, Clinical Trial and Sponsored Research Agreements\nResearch and Development Expenses – All Licenses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded the following expense in research and development for licenses\nacquired:\nFor the year ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nCity of Hope National Medical Center\nIV/ICV — 125\nHER2 — 200\nCSL Behring (Calimmune) 50 40\nFortress Annual Stock Dividend 477 1,109\nTotal $ 527 $ 1,474\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nLicense Agreements\nCity of Hope\nIV/ICV\nIn February 2017, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “IV/ICV License”) with COH to acquire intellectual\nproperty rights in patent applications related to the intraventricular (“IV”) and intracerebroventricular (“ICV”) methods of delivering T\ncells that express CARs.

A\nvaluation allowance of approximately $147.7 million and $128.1 million, respectively, was recorded for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $244.1 million and $514.9\nmillion, respectively. Approximately $220.4 million and $0.4 million of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, respectively,\ncan be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state income tax credits of approximately\n$14.1 million and $5.2 million, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2034. Under the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal\nRevenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change”, as defined therein, is subject to limitations on its use of pre-change\nNOLs and income tax credits carryforwards to offset future tax liabilities. Certain tax attributes may be subject to an annual limitation as a\nresult of the Company’s January 2017 capital raise, as it appears to constitute an ownership change under Section 382. Additionally, under\nSection 382, annual use of the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income may be limited based on cumulative\nchanges in ownership. The Company has not completed an analysis to determine whether any such\nF-29\nTable of Contents\nlimitations have been triggered as of December 31, 2023. The Company has no income tax effect due to the recognition of a full valuation\nallowance on all of its deferred tax assets as it believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized\nregardless of whether an “ownership change” has occurred.\nThere are no significant items determined to be unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, in accordance with\nASC 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial\nstatements, that have been recorded on the Company’s financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nCompany does not anticipate a material change to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nAdditionally, ASC 740 provides guidance on the recognition of interest and penalties related to income taxes. There were no interest or\npenalties related to income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and various state taxes. As of December 31, 2023, the earliest federal tax year open for the\nassessment of income taxes under the applicable statutes of limitations is its 2020 tax year.\nBeginning with the 2022 tax year, the Company is required to capitalize research and development expenses for tax purposes as defined\nunder Internal Revenue Code Section 174. For expenses that are incurred for research and development in the U.S., the amounts will be\namortized over 5 years, and for expenses that are incurred for research and development outside the U.S., the amounts will be amortized\nover 15 years. As a result of Section 174 capitalization, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $28.8 million.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") was signed into law on\nMarch 27, 2020. The CARES Act, among other things, includes tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of\nemployer's social security payments, net operating loss utilization and carryback periods and modifications to the net interest deduction\nlimitations. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s income tax provision for 2023 and 2022. The Company will\ncontinue to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“Consolidated Appropriations Act”) was signed into law. The\nConsolidated Appropriations Act is intended to enhance and expand certain provisions of the CARES Act, allows for the deductions of\nexpenses related to the Payroll Protection Program funds received by companies, and provides an update to meals and entertainment\nexpensing for 2021. The Consolidated Appropriations Act did not have a material impact to the Company’s income tax provision for 2023\nand 2022.\nNote 11 – Subsequent Events\nIn connection with the sale of the Company’s leasehold interest in its cell processing facility located in Worcester, Massachusetts and\nassociated assets relating to the manufacturing and production of cell and gene therapies at the Facility (the “Transaction”) to uBriGene\n(Boston) Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“uBriGene”) and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UBrigene (Jiangsu)\nBiosciences Co., Ltd., a Chinese contract development and manufacturing organization, the Company and uBriGene previously submitted a\nvoluntary notice with the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) on August 10, 2023 to obtain clearance\nfor the Transaction, although obtaining such clearance was not a condition to closing the Transaction.\nFollowing an initial 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period, on November 13, 2023, CFIUS requested that the\nCompany and uBriGene withdraw and re-file our joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding the nature\nand extent of national security risk posed by the Transaction.

CFIUS’s 45-day review ended on December 28,\n2023. Since CFIUS had not concluded its review by December 28, 2023, the proceeding transitioned to a subsequent 45-day investigation\nperiod, which ended on February 12, 2024.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the 45-day review period and subsequent 45-day investigation period described above, on February 12, 2024, the Company and\nuBriGene requested permission to withdraw and re-file their joint voluntary notice to allow more time for review and discussion regarding\nthe nature and extent of national security risk posed by the Transaction.

Holders of our Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock and Preferred\nStock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of\ncapital stock of the Company representing a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote,\nirrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the DGCL.\nLiquidation Rights\nUpon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably\namong the holders of our Common Stock, including Class A Common Stock, outstanding at that time after payment of other claims of creditors, if any.\nPreemptive, Conversion, or Similar Rights\nThe holders of our Common Stock have no preemptive, conversion, or subscription rights, and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions\napplicable to our Common Stock.\nDividends\nThe holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, including Class A Common Stock, are entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally\navailable at the times and in the amount that our Board of Directors may determine. All dividends are non-cumulative. No dividend or other distribution\nshall be paid or declared and set apart for payment (other than dividends payable solely in capital stock on the capital stock of the Company) on the shares\nof Common Stock of the Company until all dividends on the Class A Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment.\nClass A Common Stock\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into\nwhich the shares of Class A Common Stock held by such holder are convertible. For a period of ten (10) years from issuance, the holders of the Class A\nCommon Stock have the right to appoint one member of the Board of Directors of the Company. To date, the holders of Class A Common Stock have not\nyet appointed such director.\n1\nPreemptive, Conversion, or Similar Rights\nEach share of Class A Common Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,\nsubject to certain adjustments. If the Company, at any time effects a subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common Stock (by any stock split,\nstock dividend, recapitalization, reverse stock split or otherwise), the applicable conversion ratio in effect immediately before that subdivision is\nproportionately decreased or increased, as applicable, so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Class A\nCommon Stock shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, in proportion to such increase or decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock outstanding. Additionally, if any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Company occurs in which\nthe Common Stock (but not the Class A Common Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property, then each share of Class A\nCommon Stock becomes convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common\nStock of the Company issuable upon conversion of one share of the Class A Common Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,\nreclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction.\nPreferred Stock\nClass A Preferred Stock\nThe Class A Preferred Stock is identical to our Common Stock other than as to voting rights, conversion rights, and the PIK dividend right.\nVoting Rights\nOn any matter presented to our stockholders for their action or consideration at any meeting of our stockholders (or by written consent of\nstockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast for each share of Class A Preferred\nStock held by such holder as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter, the number of votes that is equal to one and\none-tenth (1.1) times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the number of shares of outstanding Common Stock and (B) the whole shares of\nCommon Stock in to which the shares of outstanding Class A Common Stock and the Class A Preferred Stock are convertible, and the denominator of\nwhich is the number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock. Thus, the Class A Preferred Stock will at all times constitute a voting majority.\nExcept as provided by law or by the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock will\nvote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class.\nPreemptive, Conversion, or Similar Rights\nEach share of Class A Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock,\nsubject to certain adjustments. If the Company, at any time effects a subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common Stock (by any stock split,\nstock dividend, recapitalization, reverse stock split or otherwise), the applicable conversion ratio in effect immediately before that subdivision is\nproportionately decreased or increased, as applicable, so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of Class A\nPreferred Stock shall be increased or decreased, as applicable, in proportion to such increase or decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common\nStock outstanding. Additionally, if any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, consolidation or merger involving the Company occurs in which\nthe Common Stock (but not the Class A Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash or other property, then each share of Class A\nPreferred Stock becomes convertible into the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common\nStock of the Company issuable upon conversion of one share of the Class A Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization, recapitalization,\nreclassification, consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to such transaction.\nDividends\nThe holders of the outstanding shares of Class A Preferred Stock receive on each January 1 (each a “PIK Dividend Payment Date”) after the\noriginal issuance date of the Class A Preferred Stock until the date all outstanding Class A Preferred Stock is converted into Common Stock or redeemed\n(and the purchase price is paid in full), pro rata per share dividends paid in additional fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock such that the\naggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to such PIK dividend is equal to 2.5% of the Company’s fully-diluted outstanding\ncapitalization on the date that is one business day prior to any PIK Dividend Payment Date (“PIK Record Date”). In the event the Class A Preferred Stock\nconverts into Common Stock, the holders shall receive all PIK dividends accrued through the date of such conversion. No dividend or other distribution\nshall be paid, or declared and\n2\nset apart for payment (other than dividends payable solely in capital stock on the capital stock) on the shares of Common Stock until all PIK dividends on\nthe Class A Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set apart for payment. All dividends are non-cumulative.\nUndesignated Preferred Stock\nThe undesignated Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our Board of Directors is authorized to determine or\nalter the dividend rights, dividend rate, conversion rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption (including sinking fund provisions, if any), the\nredemption price or prices, the liquidation preferences and other designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special\nrights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to fix the\nnumber of shares of any series of Preferred Stock (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding).\nCertain Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Statutory Provisions\nCertain of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below may have an anti-takeover effect\nand may delay, defer, or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a holder of shares of our Common Stock might consider in its interest, including an\nattempt that might result in a receipt of a premium over the market price for such shares.\nDirectors’ Liability; Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as the same exists or as may hereafter be amended, no\npresent or former director of the Company shall be personally liable to the Company or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty\nas a director. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we will indemnify each director and the officers, employees, and agents\ndetermined by our Board of Directors to the fullest extent provided by the laws of the State of Delaware.\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders\nOur Bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called, at any time for any purpose or purposes, by the Board of Directors or\nby such person or persons as may be authorized by the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws, or by such person or persons duly designated by the\nBoard of Directors whose powers and authority, as expressly provided in a resolution of the Board of Directors, include the power to call such meetings,\nbut such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons.\nStockholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting\nOur Bylaws provide that any action required by the DGCL to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or any\naction that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if\na consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that\nwould be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. provided that such\ncopy, facsimile, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.\nElection and Removal of Directors\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that for a period of ten (10) years from the date of the first issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock,\nthe holders of record of the shares of Class A Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities that are issued upon conversion of or in exchange for the\nClass A Common Stock and whether or not the Class A Special Conversion Termination Date (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) has occurred),\nexclusively and as a separate class, shall be entitled to appoint or elect one (1) director of the Company. The holders of record of the shares of Common\nStock and Preferred Stock (including Class A Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock) and of any other class or series of voting stock, exclusively and\nvoting together as a single class, shall be entitled to elect the balance of the total number of directors of the Company, if any.\nAny director may be removed without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class(es) of capital stock\nentitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written\nconsent of stockholders. At any meeting held for the purpose of electing a director, the presence in\n3\nperson or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the class or series entitled to elect such director shall constitute a quorum for\nthe purpose of electing such director. A vacancy in any directorship filled by the holders of any class or series shall be filled only by vote or written consent\nin lieu of a meeting of the holders of such class or series or by any remaining director or directors elected by the holders of such class or series pursuant to\nour Certificate of Incorporation.\nOur Bylaws provide that directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors\nneed not be stockholders unless so required by our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.\nEach director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier\nresignation or removal. Each director shall be a natural person. Elections of directors need not be by written ballot.\nAny director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing or electronic transmission to the Company. When one or more directors so\nresigns and the resignation is effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have the power\nto fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen\nshall hold office as provided in our Bylaws in the filling of other vacancies.\nUnless otherwise provided in our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws: (a) vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any\nincrease in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the\ndirectors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and (b) whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series\nthereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such\nclass or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining\ndirector so elected.\nAmendment of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to amend, alter, change or repeal\nany provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation, and other provisions authorized by the DGCL and the laws of the State of Delaware at the time\nin force may be added or inserted, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by law; and all rights, preferences and privileges of whatsoever nature\nconferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons whomsoever by and pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation in its present form or as\nhereafter amended, are granted subject to the rights reserved in our Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the laws of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors of the Company is\nexpressly authorized to make, alter, and repeal the Bylaws of the Company, subject to the power of the stockholders of the Company to alter or repeal any\nbylaw whether adopted by them or otherwise.\nOur Bylaws provide that the original or other bylaws of the Company may be adopted, amended, or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote;\nprovided, however, that the Company may, in our Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors.

The Plan Administrator of the Company hereby grants to the Optionee named in the Notice of\nGrant (the “Optionee”), an option (the “Option”) to purchase the number of Shares set forth in the Notice of Grant, at the\nexercise price per Share set forth in the Notice of Grant (the “Exercise Price”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the\nPlan, which is incorporated herein by reference. Subject to Section 13 of the Plan, in the event of a conflict between the terms\nand conditions of the Plan and this Option Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall prevail.\nIf designated in the Notice of Grant as an Incentive Stock Option (“ISO”), this Option is intended to qualify as an\nIncentive Stock Option as defined in Section 422 of the Code. Nevertheless, to the extent that it exceeds the $100,000 rule of\nCode Section 422(d), this Option shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option (“NSO”). To the extent this Option is not\ndesignated as an ISO in the Notice of Stock Option Grant, the Option is an NSO.\n2. Exercise of Option.\n(a) Right to Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable during its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule\nand Post-Termination Exercise Period set out in the Notice of Grant and with the applicable provisions of the Plan and this\nOption Agreement.\n(b) Method of Exercise. This Option shall be exercisable by delivery of an exercise notice in the form attached\nas Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”) which shall state the election to exercise the Option, the number of Shares with respect to\nwhich the Option is being exercised, and such other representations and agreements as may be required by the Company. The\nExercise Notice shall be accompanied by payment of the aggregate Exercise Price as to all Exercised Shares. This Option shall\nbe deemed to be exercised upon receipt by the Company of such fully executed Exercise Notice accompanied by the aggregate\nExercise Price. Optionee may exercise the Option only for whole Shares.\nNo Shares shall be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option unless such issuance and such exercise complies\nwith Applicable Laws. Assuming such compliance, for income tax purposes the Shares shall be considered transferred to the\nOptionee on the date on which the Option is exercised with respect to such Shares.\n2\n3. Optionee’s Representations. In the event the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as\namended (the “Securities Act”), at the time this Option is exercised, the Optionee shall, if required by the Company,\nconcurrently with the exercise of all or any portion of this Option, deliver to the Company his or her Investment Representation\nStatement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B.\n4. Lock-Up Period. Optionee hereby agrees that, if so requested by the Company or any representative of the\nunderwriters (the “Managing Underwriter”) in connection with any registration of the offering of any securities of the\nCompany under the Securities Act, Optionee shall not sell or otherwise transfer any Shares or other securities of the Company\nduring the 180-day period (or such other period as may be requested in writing by the Managing Underwriter and agreed to in\nwriting by the Company) (the “Market Standoff Period”) following the effective date of a registration statement of the\nCompany filed under the Securities Act. Such restriction shall apply only to the first registration statement of the Company to\nbecome effective under the Securities Act that includes securities to be sold on behalf of the Company to the public in an\nunderwritten public offering under the Securities Act. The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to\nsecurities subject to the foregoing restrictions until the end of such Market Standoff Period.\n5. Method of Payment. Payment of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be by any of the following, or a combination\nthereof, at the election of the Optionee:\n(a) cash or check;\n(b) if the fair market value of one Share is greater than the Exercise Price (at the date of calculation as set\nforth below), the Optionee may elect to receive Shares equal to the value (as determined below) of this Option (or the portion\nthereof being exercised) via a cashless exercise, in which event the Company shall issue to the Optionee a number of Shares\ncomputed using the following formula:\nX = Y (A-B)\nA\nWhere: X = the number of Shares to be issued to the Optionee\nY = the number of Shares purchasable under the Option or, if only a portion of the Option is being\nexercised, that portion of the Option being exercised (at the date of such calculation)\nA = the fair market value of one Share (at the date of such calculation)\nB = Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation)\nFor purposes of the above calculation, the “fair market value” of one Share shall be that price determined by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors in good faith; provided, however, if the Company is trading in the over the counter market or on a\nrecognized exchange, fair market value shall be the last sales price on the day prior to exercise.; or\n3\n(c) surrender of other Shares which, (i) in the case of Shares acquired upon exercise of an option, have been\nowned by the Optionee for more than six (6) months on the date of surrender, and (ii) have a Fair Market Value on the date of\nsurrender equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the exercised Shares.\n6. Restrictions on Exercise. This Option may not be exercised until such time as the Plan has been approved by the\nstockholders of the Company, or if the issuance of such Shares upon such exercise or the method of payment of consideration for\nsuch shares would constitute a violation of any Applicable Law.\n7. Non-Transferability of Option. This Option may not be transferred in any manner otherwise than by will or by the\nlaws of descent or distribution and may be exercised during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. The terms of the Plan and\nthis Option Agreement shall be binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and assigns of the Optionee.\n8. Term of Option. This Option may be exercised only within the term set out in the Notice of Grant, and may be\nexercised during such term only in accordance with the Plan and the terms of this Option.\n9. Tax Consequences. Set forth below is a brief summary as of the date of this Option of some of the federal tax\nconsequences of exercise of this Option and disposition of the Shares. THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY INCOMPLETE,\nAND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT INCLUDE\nANY DISCUSSION OF STATE OR LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES. OPTIONEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER\nBEFORE EXERCISING THIS OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.\n(a) Exercise of ISO. If this Option qualifies as an ISO, there will be no regular federal income tax liability\nupon the exercise of the Option, although the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise over the\nExercise Price will be treated as an item of adjustment to the alternative minimum tax for federal tax purposes in the year of\nexercise and may subject the Optionee to the alternative minimum tax. If the Option qualifies as an ISO and is exercised through\na cashless exercise process as described in Section 5(b) above, the exercise may be treated as a Disqualifying Disposition as to\nthe Shares surrendered such that the difference between the fair market value of the Shares surrendered over the Exercise Price\nfor those Shares will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates).\n(b) Exercise of Nonstatutory Stock Option. If this Option does not qualify as an ISO, there may be a regular\nfederal income tax liability upon the exercise of the Option. The Optionee will be treated as having received compensation\nincome (taxable at ordinary income tax rates) equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date of\nexercise over the Exercise Price and the Company will qualify for a deduction in the same amount, subject to the requirement\nthat the compensation be reasonable. If Optionee is an employee, the Company will be required to withhold from Optionee’s\ncompensation or collect from Optionee and pay to the applicable taxing authorities an amount equal to a percentage of this\ncompensation income at the time of exercise.\n4\n(c) Disposition of Shares. In the case of an NSO, if Shares are held for at least one year, any gain realized on\ndisposition of the Shares will be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income tax purposes. In the case of an ISO, if\nShares transferred pursuant to the Option are held for at least one year after exercise and are disposed of at least two years after\nthe Date of Grant, any gain realized on disposition of the Shares will also be treated as long-term capital gain for federal income\ntax purposes. If Shares purchased under an ISO are disposed of before the later of (1) the date two years after the Date of Grant,\nor (2) the date one year after the date of exercise (such disposition a “Disqualifying Disposition”), any gain realized on such\ndisposition will be treated as compensation income (taxable at ordinary income rates) in an amount equal to the excess of the\nlesser of (1) the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise, or (2) the sale price of the Shares over the Exercise Price\npaid for those Shares. The Company will also be allowed a deduction equal to any such amount recognized, subject to the\nrequirement that the compensation be reasonable.\n(d) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares. If the Option is designated as an ISO, then in the event\nof a Disqualifying Disposition, the Optionee shall immediately, and in any event not later than fifteen (15) days after such\ndisposition, notify the Company in writing of such disposition.\n10. Withholding Obligations. At the time Optionee exercises the Option (in whole or in part), or at the time of a\nDisqualifying Disposition in the case of an ISO, Optionee may incur tax obligations under federal, state, local, and/or foreign\nlaw, which the Company may be required to withhold from Optionee’s compensation or otherwise collect from Optionee.\nOptionee agrees that the Company may satisfy such withholding by any of the following means or by a combination of such\nmeans, in the Company’s discretion: (i) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to the Optionee by the Company;\n(ii) causing the Optionee to tender a cash payment; or (iii) withholding from the Shares otherwise issuable to Optionee upon\nexercise of the Option the number of Shares with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date the tax withholding obligations\nare to be determined) equal to the amount of such tax withholding; provided, however, that the number of such Shares so\nwithheld will not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the Company’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum\nstatutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax purposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to\nsupplemental taxable income (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid classification of the Shares as a liability for\nfinancial accounting purposes). Optionee understands that all matters with respect to the total amount of taxes to be withheld in\nrespect of such compensation income will be determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion. Optionee further\nunderstands that, although the Company will pay withheld amounts to the applicable taxing authorities, the Optionee remains\nresponsible for payment of all taxes due as a result of income arising under the Agreement.\n11. Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and each\nsuch counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original instrument, but all such counterparts together shall constitute one\nagreement. The Plan is incorporated herein by reference. The Plan and this Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of\nthe parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the\nCompany and Optionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Optionee’s interest\nexcept by means of a\n5\nwriting signed by the Company and Optionee. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware (with the\nexception of its conflict of law provisions).\n12. No Guarantee of Continued Service. OPTIONEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE VESTING OF\nSHARES PURSUANT TO THE VESTING SCHEDULE HEREOF IS EARNED ONLY BY CONTINUING AS AN\nEMPLOYEE OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER AT THE WILL OF THE COMPANY (NOT THROUGH THE ACT OF\nBEING HIRED, BEING GRANTED THIS OPTION OR ACQUIRING SHARES HEREUNDER). OPTIONEE FURTHER\nACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREUNDER\nAND THE VESTING SCHEDULE SET FORTH HEREIN DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE\nOF CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT FOR THE VESTING PERIOD, FOR ANY PERIOD, OR AT ALL, AND SHALL NOT\nINTERFERE IN ANY WAY WITH OPTIONEE’S RIGHT OR THE COMPANY’S RIGHT TO TERMINATE OPTIONEE’S\nRELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY AT ANY TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT CAUSE.\n[Signature Page Follows]\n6\nOptionee acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and represents that he or she is familiar with the terms and\nprovisions thereof, and hereby accepts this Option subject to all of the terms and provisions thereof. Optionee has reviewed the\nPlan and this Option in their entirety, has had an opportunity to obtain the advice of counsel prior to executing this Option and\nfully understands all provisions of the Option. Optionee hereby agrees to accept as binding, conclusive and final all decisions or\ninterpretations of the Administrator upon any questions arising under the Plan or this Option.

Entire Agreement. The Plan and Option Agreement are incorporated herein by reference. This Exercise Notice, the\nPlan, the Option Agreement and the Investment Representation Statement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with\nrespect to the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings and agreements of the Company and\nOptionee with respect to the subject matter hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Optionee’s interest except by means\nof a writing signed by the Company and Optionee.\nSubmitted by: Accepted by:\nOPTIONEE MUSTANG BIO, INC.\nSignature Signature\nPrint Name Print Name\nTitle\nAddress: Address:\nDate Received\n4\nEXHIBIT B\nINVESTMENT REPRESENTATION STATEMENT\nOPTIONEE:\nCOMPANY: MUSTANG BIO, INC.\nSECURITY: COMMON STOCK\nAMOUNT:\nDATE:\nIn connection with the purchase of the above-listed securities, I, the Optionee, represent to the Company the following.\n1. Optionee is aware of the Company’s business affairs and financial condition and has acquired sufficient\ninformation about the Company to reach an informed and knowledgeable decision to acquire the securities. Optionee is\npurchasing the securities for investment for Optionee’s own account only, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection\nwith, any “distribution” thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\n2. Optionee understands that the securities have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon a\nspecific exemption therefrom, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of Optionee’s\ninvestment intent as expressed herein.\n3. Optionee further understands that the securities must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the\nSecurities Act or unless an exemption from registration is available. Moreover, Optionee understands that the Company is under\nno obligation to register the securities. In addition, Optionee understands that the certificate evidencing the securities will be\nimprinted with a legend that prohibits the transfer of the securities unless they are registered or such registration is not required in\nthe opinion of counsel for the Company.\n4. Optionee is familiar with the provisions of Rules 144 and 701, promulgated under the Securities Act, that permit\nlimited public resale of “restricted securities” acquired, directly or indirectly, from the issuer thereof (or from an affiliate of such\nissuer) in a nonpublic offering, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nIn the event the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the securities exempt under Rule 701 may be resold by the Optionee\n90 days thereafter, subject to the satisfaction of certain of the conditions specified by Rule 144, including the sale being made\nthrough a broker in an unsolicited “broker’s transaction” or in transactions directly with a market maker (as that term is defined\nunder the Exchange Act) and, in the case of an affiliate, the availability of certain public information about the Company, and the\namount of securities being sold during any three month period not exceeding the limitations specified in Rule 144(e), if\napplicable.\n1\nIf the purchase of the securities does not qualify under Rule 701 at the time of purchase, then the securities may be\nresold by the Optionee in certain limited circumstances subject to the provisions of Rule 144, which require: (a) the availability\nof certain public information about the Company; (b) the resale occurring not less than six months after the party has purchased,\nand made full payment (within the meaning of Rule 144) for, the securities to be sold; and (c) in the case of an affiliate, the sale\nbeing made through a broker in an unsolicited “broker’s transaction” or in transactions directly with a market maker (as that term\nis defined under the Exchange Act) and the amount of securities being sold during any three-month period not exceeding the\nspecified limitations. If all of the requirements of Rule 144 are not satisfied, Optionee may be able to sell the securities without\nregistration pursuant to the exemption contained in Rule 144, provided that the resale occurs not less than one year after the party\nhas purchased, and made full payment (within the meaning of Rule 144) for, the securities.\n5. Optionee further understands that at the time Optionee wishes to sell the securities there may be no public market\nupon which to make such a sale, and that, even if such a public market then exists, the Company may not be satisfying the\ncurrent public information requirements of Rules 144 or 701, and that, in such event, Optionee may be precluded from selling the\nsecurities under Rules 144 or 701 even if the relevant holding periods have been satisfied.\n6. Optionee further understands that in the event all of the applicable requirements of Rules 144 or 701 are not\nsatisfied, registration under the Securities Act or some registration exemption will be required; and that, notwithstanding the fact\nthat Rules 144 and 701 are not exclusive, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has expressed its opinion that\npersons proposing to sell private placement securities other than in a registered offering and otherwise than pursuant to Rules 144\nor 701 will have a substantial burden of proof in establishing that an exemption from registration is available for such offers or\nsales, and that such persons and their brokers who participate in such transactions do so at their own risk.\nOPTIONEE\nSignature\nPrint Name\nDate\nExhibit 10.29\nMUSTANG BIO, INC.\n2016 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nThis Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this “Agreement”) is made and entered into between Mustang Bio, Inc.

This Agreement sets forth the terms and\nconditions associated with the Company’s award to Grantee of Restricted Stock Units payable as described below in shares of Common\nStock from the Company pursuant to the Company’s 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) for the number of Units set forth below\n(collectively, the “Award”). Capitalized terms used herein which are not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings ascribed to them\nunder the Plan.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and Grantee’s continued provision of valuable services as an employee or\nconsultant of the Company, it is agreed by and between the parties as follows:\n1. Grant of Units. Effective as of the Date of Grant, the Company hereby grants the Grantee [ ] Restricted Stock Units (the\n“Units”). The Units are subject to the vesting, payment, and other provisions of this Agreement and the Plan. Each Unit represents the value\nof one (1) share of Common Stock of the Company (a “Share”). The Company will account for the Units in a bookkeeping account on the\nGrantee’s behalf until they become payable or are forfeited.\n2. Vesting. The Units are unvested when granted, and will vest as described below, provided that vesting may accelerate or\ncease as provided for in this Agreement or in the Plan.\n[Vesting Schedule]\n3. Effect of Termination of Continuous Service. In the event of the termination of Grantee’s Continuous Service, all Units\nthat are not vested will be forfeited.\n4. Delivery of Shares to Settle Vested Units. Units vested as provided in Section 2 will be settled by delivering to Grantee a\nnumber of Shares equal to the number of vested Units as soon as practicable after the vesting date, provided that the Company may provide a\nreasonable delay in the issuance or delivery of the Shares to address tax withholding and other administrative matters and provided further\nthat delivery of the Shares will occur no later than two and one-half months following the conclusion of the year in which the vesting occurs.\nOn such date, the Company will, at its election, either: (a) issue a certificate representing the Shares payable pursuant to this Agreement; or\n(b) not issue any certificate representing the Shares payable pursuant to this Agreement and instead document the Grantee’s interest in the\nShares by registering such Shares with the Company’s transfer agent (or another custodian selected by the Company) in book entry form in\nthe Grantee’s name.\n5. Capitalization Changes. The number of Units convertible to Shares subject to this Award may be adjusted from time to\ntime by the Administrator to account for changes in capitalization as described in Section 12 of the Plan.\n6. Rights as a Stockholder. The Units represent a right to payment from the Company if the conditions of the Agreement are\nmet and do not give the Grantee ownership of any Common Stock prior to delivery as provided in Section 4.

Non-Transferability of the Award.

Any purported\ntransfer of the Units or the right to payment under this Agreement is null and void and will not be given effect.\n8. Award Not An Employment Agreement. The Award is not an employment or service contract, and nothing this Agreement\nconfers or will be construed as conferring upon the Grantee any right to continue in the employment or service of the Company, or as\ninterfering with or restricting in any way the right of either party to terminate such employment or service at any time.\n9. Tax Consequences. Grantee acknowledges that he/she understands the federal, state, and local tax consequences of the\nAward and the issuance, vesting, forfeiture, and delivery provisions hereof relating to the Units. Grantee will rely solely on the advice of\nhis/her own tax advisors and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents. Grantee understands that Grantee\n(and not the Company) shall be responsible for his/her own tax liability that may arise as a result of the Award or the transactions\ncontemplated by this Agreement.\n10. Withholding Obligations. Grantee understands that, at the time that Grantee becomes vested and/or receives payment for\nany Units (including through the delivery of Shares), the Company may be required to withhold federal, state and local income and\nemployment taxes. At the time of vesting, or at or before the time Grantee receives a distribution of the Shares underlying the Units or other\nconsideration, or at any time thereafter as requested by the Company, Grantee hereby authorizes the Company to satisfy any required\nwithholding to satisfy federal, state, local, payroll, and foreign tax withholding obligations of the Company or any Affiliate that arise in\nconnection with the Units (the “Withholding Taxes”). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Company may, in its sole\ndiscretion, satisfy all or any portion of the Withholding Taxes obligation relating to the Units by any of the following means or by a\ncombination of such means: (a) withholding from any compensation otherwise payable to the Grantee by the Company; (b) causing the\nGrantee to tender a cash payment; or (c) withholding Shares from the Shares issued or otherwise issuable to Grantee in connection with the\nUnits with a Fair Market Value (measured as of the date the Withholding Taxes are to be determined) equal to the amount of such\nWithholding Taxes; provided, however, that the number of such Shares so withheld shall not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the\nCompany’s required tax withholding obligations using the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state, local and foreign tax\npurposes, including payroll taxes, that are applicable to supplemental taxable income (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to avoid\nclassification of the Units as a liability for financial accounting purposes). Grantee understands that all matters with respect to the total\namount of taxes to be withheld in respect of such compensation income will be determined by the Administrator in its reasonable discretion.\nGrantee further understands that, although the Company may pay withheld amounts to the applicable taxing authorities, the Grantee is\nresponsible for payment of all taxes due as a result of compensation arising under the Agreement.\n11. Data Privacy. Grantee acknowledges that the Company holds certain personal information about Grantee, including, but\nnot limited to: name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social security number or other identification number, compensation,\nnationality, job title, details of the Award, and any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, cancelled, exercised, vested or unvested.\nGrantee consents to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of such personal data for the purpose of implementing,\nadministering, and managing this Award.\nMustang Bio, Inc. · 377 Plantation Street · Worcester, MA · 01605\n12.

(“Company”) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to adopt\nthis Clawback Policy (“Policy”) which provides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of an Accounting Restatement (as\ndefined below).\nThis Policy is designed to comply with, and shall be interpreted to be consistent with, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(“Exchange Act”), and final rules and amendments adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to implement the aforementioned\nlegislation, and Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange’s listing standards.\nThis policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023, the Effective Date of Rule 5608 of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange’s listing standards (the “Effective\nDate”) and applies to all Covered Officers (as defined below) of Mustang Bio, Inc.\nAdministration\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board (if composed entirely of independent directors) or if so designated by the\nBoard, a separate committee of the Board, consisting of a majority of the independent directors serving on the board (as applicable, the “Administrator”).\nThe Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the\nadministration of this Policy. Any determinations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform\nwith respect to each individual covered by the Policy. In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the\nfull Board or such other committees of the Board, such as the Audit Committee or the Compensation Committee, as may be necessary or appropriate as to\nmatters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority.\nSubject to any limitation under applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all\nactions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such\nofficer or employee).\nDefinitions\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following definitions will apply:\n“Accounting Restatement” means an accounting restatement of the Company’s financial statements due to the Company’s material noncompliance with\nany financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including those that either (a) correct an error in a previously issued financial statement that\nis material to such previously issued financial statement or (b) correct an error that is not material to a previously issued financial statement but would\nresult in a material misstatement if left uncorrected in a current report or the error correction was not recognized in the current period.\n“Administrator” has the meaning set forth in the “Administration” section above.\n“Board” means the Company’s Board of Directors.\n\"Clawback Exception” has the meaning ascribed to such term in the “Clawback Exceptions” section below.\n“Covered Officer” means the Company’s officers for purposes of Section 16 under the Exchange Act during any portion of the performance period of the\nIncentive-Based Compensation.\n“Excess Compensation” means any amount of Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a Covered Officer that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined\n1\nbased on the restated financial information or properly calculated financial measure. Excess Compensation shall be calculated on a pre-tax basis.\n“Incentive-Based Compensation” means any non-equity incentive plan awards, bonuses paid from a bonus pool, cash awards, equity or equity-based\nawards, or proceeds received upon sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan; provided that such compensation is granted, earned, and/or vested\nbased wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial performance measure, as determined in accordance with Section 10D of the Exchange Act and the\nNasdaq Stock Exchange listing standards (the “Clawback Rules”). Incentive-Based Compensation does not include any salaries, discretionary bonuses,\nnon-equity incentive plan awards earned upon satisfying a strategic measure or operational measure (e.g., completion of a project), or equity-based awards\nthat are not contingent on achieving any financial reporting measure (e.g., time vested stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units).\n“Look-Back Period” means the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the earlier of the date on which (a) the Board or appropriate\ncommittee concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that an Accounting Restatement is required or (b) a regulator directs an Accounting\nRestatement.\n“Received” means any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received during the fiscal year in which the applicable financial reporting measure upon\nwhich the payment is based is achieved, even if payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of such period.\nClawback Due to Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator shall require reimbursement or forfeiture\n(“clawback”) of any Excess Compensation Received by any Covered Officer (current or former) during the applicable Look-Back Period, regardless of\nwhether the Covered Officer engaged in misconduct or was otherwise directly or indirectly responsible, in whole or in part, for the Accounting\nRestatement.\nIn the event the Administrator cannot determine the Excess Compensation from the information in the Accounting Restatement or from the\nrecalculated financial measure, then it will make its determination based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement or\nrecalculation. Such determination will be final and binding.\nIf a Clawback Exception applies with respect to a Covered Officer, the Company may forgo the recovery described in this Section from such\nCovered Officer.\nClawback Method\nThe Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion, the method for the clawback of any amounts due under this Policy, which may include\nwithout limitation direct payment from the Covered Officer, recovery over time, the forfeiture or reduction of future pay or awards, or any other method\nthat will provide for recovery within a reasonable manner and without undue delay. The Company may enter into deferred payment plans with Covered\nOfficers to effectuate clawback to avoid unreasonable economic hardship. Any amounts due under this Policy may be deducted as an offset from amounts\ndue to the Covered Officer from the Company, except to the extent such set-off is prohibited by law or would violate Section 409A of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended and the regulations thereunder.\nClawback Exceptions\nThe Company will be required, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, to recover all Excess Compensation received by a Covered Officer\nduring the Look-Back Period unless: (i) one of the following conditions is met; and (ii) the Committee has made a determination that recovery would be\nimpracticable in accordance with Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act:\n(i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (and the Company has\nalready made a reasonable attempt to recover such erroneously awarded Excess Compensation from such Covered Officer, has\ndocumented such\n2\nreasonable attempt(s) to recover, and has provided such documentation to the Nasdaq Stock Exchange);\n(ii) recovery would violate home country laws that existed at the time of adoption of the rule and the Company receives an opinion of\ncounsel to that effect; or\n(iii) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations\nthereunder. For purposes of clarity, this Clawback Exception only applies to tax-qualified retirement plans and does not apply to other\nplans, including long term disability, life insurance, and supplemental executive retirement plans, or any other compensation that is based\non Incentive-Based Compensation in such plans, such as earnings accrued on notional amounts of Incentive-Based Compensation\ncontributed to such plans.\nGeneral\nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer against the loss of any covered compensation as a result of the application of this Policy.\nThis Policy is in addition to (and not in lieu of) any right of repayment, forfeiture or right of offset against any employees that is required pursuant\nto any statutory repayment requirement (regardless of whether implemented at any time prior to or following the adoption or amendment of this Policy),\nincluding Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any amounts paid to the Company pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nshall be considered in determining any amounts recovered under this Policy.\nThe terms of this Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Officers subject to this Policy and their beneficiaries, heirs,\nexecutors, or other legal representatives. If any provision of this Policy or the application of such provision to any Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to\nbe invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the\ninvalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to render any such provision (or the application of\nsuch provision) valid, legal or enforceable.\nEach Covered Officer shall sign and return to the Company, within the later of: (i) 60 calendar days following the Effective Date or (ii) 30\ncalendar days following the date the individual becomes a Covered Officer, the Acknowledgement and Agreement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A,\npursuant to which the Covered Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.\nTo the extent the Clawback Rules require recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation in additional circumstances beyond those specified above,\nnothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right or obligation of the Company to recover Incentive-Based Compensation to the fullest\nextent required by the Clawback Rules.\nThe Board may amend this Policy from time-to-time in its discretion and as necessary to comply with any rules or standards adopted by the SEC\nand the listings standards of any national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n3\nExhibit A\nMustang Bio, Inc.
