(“Mustang” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MBIO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has granted Orphan Drug Designation to Mustang for MB-108, a herpes simplex virus type 1 (“HSV-1”) oncolytic virus, for the treatment of malignant glioma.\n\nThe FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation to drugs and biologics that are intended for safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Orphan Drug Designation provides certain incentives, such as tax credits toward the cost of clinical trials upon approval and prescription drug user fee waivers. If a product receives Orphan Drug Status from the FDA, that product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity for the disease in which it has Orphan Drug designation, which is independent from intellectual property protection.\n\nManuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang, said, “The Orphan Drug Designation for MB-108 is significant for Mustang, as it could provide additional market exclusivity and we hope to advance MB-108, in combination with MB-101, as a potential treatment option for patients living with malignant glioma, including patients with recurrent glioblastoma (“GBM”) and high-grade astrocytomas, where there is historically a median overall survival of six months. Our novel therapeutic strategy, combining our MB-108 oncolytic virus with MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy, could be the first-ever industry-sponsored trial of its kind for the treatment of malignant glioma. As such, Mustang plans to also request Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy) in malignant gliomas. These advancements highlight our dedication to potentially improving outcomes for patients battling difficult-to-treat cancers.”\n\nAs previously reported, preclinical data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting in 2022 supported a combination therapy to potentially optimize results to treat recurrent GBM. The combination leverages MB-108 to reshape the tumor microenvironment (“TME”) and make cold tumors “hot,” thereby potentially improving the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. Data presented separately on MB-101 and MB-108 showed that administration of these therapies was well tolerated in recurrent GBM patients. Two patients treated solely with MB-101 who had high levels of intratumoral CD3+ T cells pre-therapy (i.e., “hot” tumors) achieved complete responses lasting 7.5 and 31+ months, respectively. Importantly, of the 53 City of Hope Phase 1 patients disclosed at AACR in 2022, these 2 complete responses were observed in the 2 patients with the “hottest” tumors prior to treatment with MB-101. Phase 1 clinical trials of MB-101 at City of Hope and of MB-108 at The University of Alabama at Birmingham continue to enroll patients.\n\nThe Company’s ability to further develop the MB-109 program for recurrent GBM and high-grade astrocytomas is contingent upon raising additional funding and / or consummating a strategic partnership.\n\n**About MB-109 (MB-101 (IL13Rα2** **targeted CAR-T cells) + MB-108 oncolytic virus)** MB-109 is Mustang’s designation for the treatment regimen combining MB-101 (IL13Rα2‐targeted CAR-T cell therapy licensed from City of Hope) with MB-108 (HSV-1 oncolytic virus licensed from Nationwide Children’s Hospital). The combination is designed to leverage MB-108 to make cold tumors “hot” and potentially improve the efficacy of MB-101 CAR-T cell therapy. MB-108 oncolytic virus is first injected to infect tumor cells which, in turn, leads to reshaping of the TME through recruitment of endogenous CD8- and CD3-positive effector T-cells. This inflamed TME potentially permits MB-101 CAR-T cells injected into and around the tumor to better infiltrate into and throughout the tumor mass, undergo activation and, ideally, effect tumor cell killing.\n\n**About Mustang Bio** Mustang Bio, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on translating today’s medical breakthroughs in cell therapies into potential cures for difficult-to-treat cancers.
