Spray, president and chief executive officer, commented: \"We responded to 20 weather-related catastrophes across the U.S. in the third quarter, including Hurricane Helene, which swept through 11 states at the end of September. Our hearts go out to these communities and their residents who are trying to put lives, homes and businesses back together. Confident in our financial strength, our field claims associates can shine, responding in person, paying claims and delivering fair, fast and empathetic service.\n\n\"Those catastrophes added 13 points to our combined ratio for the quarter, just above our 5-year third-quarter average of 12.2%, bringing our combined ratio to 97.4%. As evidence of our ongoing focus on increasing product and geographic diversification, fine-tuning pricing precision and applying our underwriting expertise, our nine-month underwriting profit improved 53%, growing to $228 million compared to $149 million for the first nine months of 2023. Our combined ratio for the year through September 30 is 96.5% – comfortably within our target long-term average range of 92% to 98%.\n\n\"Investment income for the third quarter also grew, rising 15% to $258 million, driven by a 21% increase in bond interest income. Our investment professionals regularly trim or exit equity positions as they work to keep our investment portfolio optimized to balance near-term income generation with long-term book value growth potential. During the quarter we had $959 million in net sales of equity securities and $672 million in net purchases of fixed-maturity securities. This does not signal a change to our investment strategy. We will continue to hold both significant equity and bond portfolios.\"\n\n**Stability for Agents** \"As we've visited with agents during the third quarter, they shared how they appreciate our responsiveness and our stability as we offer them options for new business opportunities even through the market turbulence of the past year. Our associates working with the independent agents who represent us are answering the call, crafting risk management solutions that showcase our expertise across every segment of our business. \n\n\"In the first nine months of 2024, property casualty net written premiums topped $7 billion, up 14% compared with the first nine-months last year – a new record. We continued to write healthy amounts of both new and renewal business, with commercial lines growing 8%, personal lines at 30% and excess and surplus lines at 15%.\" \n\n**Value for Shareholders** \"At September 30, our book value per share again reached a record high, increasing 15% since December 31, 2023, to $88.32. Consolidated cash and total investments climbed to nearly $30 billion. Our value creation ratio, which considers the dividends we pay as well as our growth in book value, was 17.8% for the first nine months – ahead of our 10% to 13% average annual target for this measure.\"\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Insurance Operations Highlights**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Property Casualty Insurance Results**  \n(Dollars in millions) | Three months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n**2024** | 2023 | % Change | **2024** | 2023 | % Change  \nEarned premiums | **$ 2,217** | $ 1,957 | 13 | **$ 6,284** | $ 5,661 | 11  \nFee revenues | **3** | 3 | 0 | **9** | 8 | 13  \nTotal revenues | **2,220** | 1,960 | 13 | **6,293** | 5,669 | 11  \nLoss and loss expenses | **1,499** | 1,261 | 19 | **4,181** | 3,840 | 9  \nUnderwriting expenses | **659** | 587 | 12 | **1,884** | 1,680 | 12  \nUnderwriting profit  | **$ 62** | $ 112 | (45) | **$ 228** | $ 149 | 53  \nRatios as a percent of earned premiums: | Pt.

Statutory data is prepared in accordance with statutory accounting rules for insurance company regulation in the United States of America as defined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, and therefore is not reconciled to GAAP data.\n\nManagement uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its primary business areas – property casualty insurance, life insurance and investments. Management uses these measures when analyzing both GAAP and non-GAAP results to improve its understanding of trends in the underlying business and to help avoid incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions about the success or failure of company strategies. Management adjustments to GAAP measures generally: apply to non-recurring events that are unrelated to business performance and distort short-term results; involve values that fluctuate based on events outside of management's control; supplement reporting segment disclosures with disclosures for a subsidiary company or for a combination of subsidiaries or reporting segments; or relate to accounting refinements that affect comparability between periods, creating a need to analyze data on the same basis.\n\n  * Non-GAAP operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding investment gains and losses (defined as investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) and other significant non-recurring items from net income. Management evaluates non-GAAP operating income to measure the success of pricing, rate and underwriting strategies. While investment gains (or losses) are integral to the company's insurance operations over the long term, the determination to realize investment gains or losses on fixed-maturity securities sold in any period may be subject to management's discretion and is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Also, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, gains and losses are recognized from certain changes in market values of securities without actual realization. Management believes that the level of investment gains or losses for any particular period, while it may be material, may not fully indicate the performance of ongoing underlying business operations in that period.For these reasons, many investors and shareholders consider non-GAAP operating income to be one of the more meaningful measures for evaluating insurance company performance. Equity analysts who report on the insurance industry and the company generally focus on this metric in their analyses. The company presents non-GAAP operating income so that all investors have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information.\n  * Consolidated property casualty insurance results: To supplement reporting segment disclosures related to our property casualty insurance operations, we also evaluate results for those operations on a basis that includes results for our property casualty insurance and brokerage services subsidiaries. That is the total of our commercial lines, personal lines and our excess and surplus lines segments plus our reinsurance assumed operations known as Cincinnati Re and our London-based global specialty underwriter known as Cincinnati Global.\n  * Life insurance subsidiary results: To supplement life insurance reporting segment disclosures related to our life insurance operation, we also evaluate results for that operation on a basis that includes life insurance subsidiary investment income, or investment income plus investment gains and losses, that are also included in our investments reporting segment. We recognize that assets under management, capital appreciation and investment income are integral to evaluating the success of the life insurance segment because of the long duration of life products. \n\n\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Cincinnati Financial Corporation**  \n---  \n**Net Income Reconciliation**  \n(Dollars in millions, except per share data) | Three months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n**2024** | 2023 | **2024** | 2023  \nNet income (loss) | **$ 820** | $ (99) | **$ 1,887** | $ 660  \nLess:  \nInvestment gains and losses, net | **758** | (456) | **1,507** | 84  \nIncome tax on investment gains and losses  | **(162)** | 96 | **(320)** | (17)  \nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax | **596** | (360) | **1,187** | 67  \nNon-GAAP operating income | **$ 224** | $ 261 | **$ 700** | $ 593  \nDiluted per share data:  \nNet income (loss) | **$ 5.20** | $ (0.63) | **$ 11.97** | $ 4.17  \nLess:  \nInvestment gains and losses, net | **4.80** | (2.90) | **9.55** | 0.53  \nIncome tax on investment gains and losses  | **(1.02)** | 0.61 | **(2.02)** | (0.11)  \nInvestment gains and losses, after-tax | **3.78** | (2.29) | **7.53** | 0.42  \nNon-GAAP operating income | **$ 1.42** | $ 1.66 | **$ 4.44** | $ 3.75  \n**Life Insurance Reconciliation**  \n(Dollars in millions) | Three months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n**2024** | 2023 | **2024** | 2023  \nNet income of the life insurance subsidiary | **$ 20** | $ 25 | **$ 63** | $ 65  \nInvestment gains and losses, net  | **—** | — | **(9)** | (1)  \nIncome tax on investment gains and losses | **—** | — | **(2)** | —  \nNon-GAAP operating income | **20** | 25 | **70** | 66  \nInvestment income, net of expenses  | **(48)** | (46) | **(142)** | (137)  \nInvestment income credited to contract holders | **32** | 31 | **94** | 91  \nIncome tax excluding tax on investment gains  and losses, net | **6** | 7 | **20** | 18  \nLife insurance segment profit | **$ 10** | $ 17 | **$ 42** | $ 38  \n  \nView News Release Full Screen**Property Casualty Insurance Reconciliation**  \n---  \n(Dollars in millions) | Three months ended September 30, 2024  \nConsolidated | Commercial | Personal | E&S | Other*  \nPremiums:  \nNet written premiums | **$ 2,293** | **$ 1,138** | **$ 832** | **$ 157** | **$ 166**  \nUnearned premiums change | **(76)** | **(1)** | **(154)** | **—** | **79**  \nEarned premiums | **$ 2,217** | **$ 1,137** | **$ 678** | **$ 157** | **$ 245**  \nUnderwriting profit (loss) | **$ 62** | **$ 81** | **$ (69)** | **$ 8** | **$ 42**  \n(Dollars in millions) | Nine months ended September 30, 2024  \nConsolidated | Commercial | Personal | E&S | Other*  \nPremiums:  \nNet written premiums | **$ 7,000** | **$ 3,547** | **$ 2,246** | **$ 483** | **$ 724**  \nUnearned premiums change | **(716)** | **(221)** | **(349)** | **(36)** | **(110)**  \nEarned premiums | **$ 6,284** | **$ 3,326** | **$ 1,897** | **$ 447** | **$ 614**  \nUnderwriting profit (loss) | **$ 228** | **$ 130** | **$ (74)** | **$ 28** | **$ 144**  \n(Dollars in millions) | Three months ended September 30, 2023  \nConsolidated | Commercial | Personal | E&S | Other*  \nPremiums:  \nNet written premiums | $ 1,957 | $ 1,029 | $ 646 | $ 128 | $ 154  \nUnearned premiums change | — | 33 | (119) | 7 | 79  \nEarned premiums | $ 1,957 | $ 1,062 | $ 527 | $ 135 | $ 233  \nUnderwriting profit  | $ 112 | $ 52 | $ 1 | $ 14 | $ 45  \n(Dollars in millions) | Nine months ended September 30, 2023  \nConsolidated | Commercial | Personal | E&S | Other*  \nPremiums:  \nNet written premiums | $ 6,126 | $ 3,276 | $ 1,723 | $ 420 | $ 707  \nUnearned premiums change | (465) | (92) | (239) | (26) | (108)  \nEarned premiums | $ 5,661 | $ 3,184 | $ 1,484 | $ 394 | $ 599  \nUnderwriting profit (loss) | $ 149 | $ 83 | $ (92) | $ 38 | $ 120  \nDollar amounts shown are rounded to millions; certain amounts may not add due to rounding.  *Included in Other are the results of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.  \n  \n**Cincinnati Financial Corporation**\n\n**Other Measures**\n\n  * Value creation ratio: This is a measure of shareholder value creation that management believes captures the contribution of the company's insurance operations, the success of its investment strategy and the importance placed on paying cash dividends to shareholders. The value creation ratio measure is made up of two primary components: (1) rate of growth in book value per share plus (2) the ratio of dividends declared per share to beginning book value per share. Management believes this measure is useful, providing a meaningful measure of long-term progress in creating shareholder value. It is intended to be all-inclusive regarding changes in book value per share, and uses originally reported book value per share in cases where book value per share has been adjusted, such as adoption of Accounting Standards Updates with a cumulative effect of a change in accounting.\n  * Written premium: Under statutory accounting rules in the U.S., property casualty written premium is the amount recorded for policies issued and recognized on an annualized basis at the effective date of the policy. Management analyzes trends in written premium to assess business efforts. The difference between written and earned premium is unearned premium.\n\n\n\nView News Release Full Screen**Value Creation Ratio Calculations**  \n---  \n(Dollars are per share) | Three months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n**2024** | 2023 | **2024** | 2023  \n**Value creation ratio:**  \nEnd of period book value*  | **$ 88.32** | $ 67.72 | **$ 88.32** | $ 67.72  \nLess beginning of period book value | **81.79** | 70.33 | **77.06** | 67.01  \nChange in book value  | **6.53** | (2.61) | **11.26** | 0.71  \nDividend declared to shareholders | **0.81** | 0.75 | **2.43** | 2.25  \nTotal value creation  | **$ 7.34** | $ (1.86) | **$ 13.69** | $ 2.96  \nValue creation ratio from change in book value** | **8.0 %** | (3.7) % | **14.6 %** | 1.1 %  \nValue creation ratio from dividends declared to  shareholders***  | **1.0** | 1.1 | **3.2** | 3.3  \nValue creation ratio | **9.0 %** | (2.6) % | **17.8 %** | 4.4 %  \n* Book value per share is calculated by dividing end of period total shareholders' equity by end of period shares outstanding  \n** Change in book value divided by the beginning of period book value   \n*** Dividend declared to shareholders divided by beginning of period book value  \n  \n[![Cincinnati Financial Corporation logo. \\(PRNewsFoto/Cincinnati Financial Corporation\\) \\(PRNewsFoto/CINCINNATI FINANCIAL CORPORATION\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/327312/cincinnati_financial_corporation_logo.jpg)](javascript:void\\(0\\); \"Third Party Website Link\")\n\nSOURCE Cincinnati Financial Corporation\n\nFor further information: Investor Contact: Dennis E.
