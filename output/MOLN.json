Posters will be presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC), being held November 8–10 in Houston, TX, with the following details:\n\n**Title:**_Unlocking precision: a next generation multi-specific CD3 Switch-DARPin with enhanced function to tackle the current limitations of T cell engagers in ovarian cancer_**Abstract & Poster Number: **842\n\n**Title:**_Comprehensive biomarker analyses from a Phase 1 study reveals marked tumor microenvironment modulation in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with MP0317, a FAP-localized CD40 agonistic DARPin_**Abstract & Poster Number: **612\n\n**Timing & Location: **November 9, 2024 at 9 am – 8:30 pm CT; Exhibit Halls AB\n\nBoth posters will be made available on Molecular Partner’s website in the [Scientific Documents section](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SITgFNCB0pckQQ0nRXvdStQw8VRbJQSIBx4rEKQMBdbuwFwyEj57hVWL5GUb9kEb5x3AiYTozj0dETDqdagmGgWHy36mOVeA9zalRXZBJ236vfmtuoFZXock2O2HJ2q1HrWt1HqfmkhcPNM08GzkQQ==).\n\n\"Our Switch-DARPin platform provides a novel approach to tumor-localized T-cell engagement and costimulation through its logic-gated on/off Switch mechanism. We are excited to have the opportunity to add this MoA to our validated CD3 T cell engager approach,” said Patrick Amstutz, Ph.D., CEO of Molecular Partners. “We hope to open therapeutic avenues for co-stimulating T-cell engagers, by rendering them silent in the circulation and activating them at the tumor site.”\n\n**CD3 Switch-DARPin: Preclinical proof-of-concept for T cell engager with enhanced function in solid tumors**\n\nThe Switch-DARPin platform provides a logic-gated “on/off” function (the “Switch”) to multispecific DARPin candidates leading to immune activation only in the presence of defined antigens. This allows targeting the immune activation to tumors, increasing both efficacy and safety and opening up new opportunities for cancer treatment. T cell engagers (TCE) are a powerful class of immuno-oncology therapies but have faced a range of challenges such as high toxicity and limited specificity, particularly against solid tumors. By employing a multi-specific Switch-DARPin, Molecular Partners aims to bring additional dimensions of safety and potency to the fundamental TCE mechanism.\n\nThe data to be presented at SITC provide further validation of the Company’s Switch-DARPin platform and preclinical proof-of concept that conditional T cell activation in solid tumors is feasible, as exemplified in preclinical ovarian cancer models. The presented multi-specific Switch-DARPin molecule comprises DARPins targeting:\n\n  1. CD3, to engage and activate T cells\n  2. CD2, a co-stimulator of CD3 on T cells\n  3. Mesothelin, a notable tumor antigen overexpressed across several cancer types, including ovarian cancer, and used as anchoring target for the Switch-DARPin\n  4. And the Switch-DARPin, which binds either to the tumor antigen EpCAM or to the CD3 DARPin mentioned above. In a default state, the whole molecule is in closed state (or Switched off), masking the CD3 DARPin and preventing immune activation. When tumor antigens mesothelin and EpCAM are present, the Switch-DARPin “switches” to bind EpCAM instead of the CD3 DARPin, thereby freeing the CD3 DARPin and allowing it to bind and activate T cells. T cell activation is further enhanced through co-stimulation by the CD2 DARPin.\n\n\n\nThis CD3 Switch-DARPin molecule effectively induces potent tumor regression _in vivo_ , with reduced cytokine release, a significant toxicity event for TCEs in the clinic, compared to an unmasked CD3 with CD2 co-stimulation. In addition, co-engagement of CD2 leads to sustained T cell activation and cytotoxic capacity. Finally, masking of CD3 prevents T cell activation in the absence of tumor antigens, hence potentially allowing for “silent” TCEs outside of tumors. Taken together, masking CD3 may reduce the risk of CRS and provide a better safety profile to TCEs.\n\n**MP0317: Comprehensive biomarker data further support CD40 activation locally in tumor microenvironment**\n\nMP0317 is a CD40 agonist designed to activate immune cells specifically within the tumor microenvironment (TME) by anchoring to fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is expressed in high amounts in the stroma of various solid tumors. This tumor-localized approach has the potential to deliver greater efficacy with fewer side effects compared to systemic CD40-targeting therapies.\n\nThe poster presents the results of a comprehensive biomarker analyses from the completed Phase 1 multi-center, open label, dose-escalation trial of MP0317 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The research further demonstrates the ability of MP0317 to induce a targeted, tumor-localized CD40 activation and its suitability for Q3W (every three weeks) and Q1W (weekly) dosing. The CD40 pathway is activated in a broad-spectrum of cancer types and various tumor locations. Evidence of TME remodeling in patients treated with pharmacologically active doses is exemplified by increases in dendritic cells, M1 macrophages, plasma cells, and T follicular helper cells, as well as IFNγ downstream activation and an increased dendritic cell maturation gene signature score. Peripheral pharmacodynamic effects aligned with the MP0317 mode of action are also seen, including increases in CXCL10 chemoattractant, transient B-cell reduction, and activation in blood.\n\nMolecular Partners is in discussion with leading academic centers regarding potential investigator-initiated combination trials of MP0317.\n\n**About DARPin Therapeutics** DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design. The flexible architecture, intrinsic potential for high affinity and specificity, small size and high stability of DARPins offer benefits to drug design over other currently available protein-based therapeutics. DARPin candidates can be radically simple, with a single DARPin unit acting as the delivery vector to a specific target; or multispecific, with the possibility of engaging more than five targets, and combining multiple and conditional functionalities in a unique DARPin drug candidate. The DARPin platform is designed to be a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery engine, producing drug candidates with optimized properties and high production yields. DARPin therapeutics have been clinically validated across several therapeutic areas and developed through to the registrational stage.\n\n**About Molecular Partners AG** Molecular Partners AG is a clinical-stage biotech company pioneering the design and development of DARPin therapeutics for medical challenges other drug modalities cannot readily address. The Company has programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, with oncology as its main focus. Molecular Partners leverages the advantages of DARPins to provide unique solutions to patients through its proprietary programs as well as through partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies. Molecular Partners was founded in 2004 and has offices in both Zurich, Switzerland and Concord, MA, USA.

The mechanism of action of MP0533 is designed to preferentially kill AML cells that express any combination of these three TAAs while sparing healthy cells, which express only one or none of these targets. The immune activation against the malignant cells is achieved through CD3-mediated T cell-engagement.\n\nThe poster to be presented at ASH 2024 will provide a clinical update of the ongoing first-in-human dose-escalation phase 1/2a study of MP0533 in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/AML. MP0533 showed an acceptable safety profile in the first 7 dose cohorts, with the majority of adverse events reported being infusion-related reactions and cytokine release syndrome.\n\nBased on this observed tolerability profile and initial antitumor and pharmacodynamic activity data, Molecular Partners is amending the protocol to further optimize the dosing schedule and improve the exposure profile of MP0533.\n\n**About MP0621 (cKit x CD16a x CD47)**\n\nMP0621 is a Switch-DARPin candidate designed to induce killing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as a next-generation conditioning regimen for HSC transplantation (HSCT). The Switch-DARPin platform provides a logic-gated “on/off” function (the “Switch”) to multispecific DARPin candidates leading to target activation only in the presence of defined antigens. In MP0621, the Switch-DARPin binds to either cellular cKit or to the anti-CD47 DARPin binder. Upon MP0621 binding to cKit on HSCs, the Switch-DARPin will unmask the anti-CD47 DARPin, which in turn will bind CD47 and block the “don’t-eat-me” signal, leveraging the power of CD47 inhibition without its associated toxicity to healthy cells.\n\nThe poster to be presented at ASH 2024 builds on the data presented earlier this year at the European Haematology Association 2024 Congress and provides further preclinical _in vivo_ proof-of-mechanism data, demonstrating that MP0621 could be an efficient next-generation conditioning regimen for autologous HSCT.\n\n_A_ _t present non-human primate data do not indicate that MP0621 would serve as a treatment for AML, as was previously hypothesized, in addition to HSCT._ As Molecular Partners’ portfolio strategy prioritizes therapeutic candidates for oncology, MP0621 is being evaluated for partnering.\n\n**About DARPin Therapeutics** DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design.

DLL3 remains a highly interesting target that is gaining significant attention. Our team presented additional preclinical data showing that MP0712 is safe and efficacious in a highly relevant tumor model, with DLL3 expression levels matching those in human tumors,\" said Patrick Amstutz, Ph.D., Molecular Partners’ Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, we strengthened our relationship with our partner Orano Med, ensuring that both parties will have the opportunity to bring two Radio-DARPin products to market, for a total of four. Lastly our recent capital raise allows us additional financial flexibility into 2027 with participation from new, specialized investors and supportive existing investors.”\n\n**Financial and Business Outlook**\n\nFor the full year 2024, at constant exchange rates, the Company reiterates its guidance for total expenses of CHF 65–70 million. Approximately CHF 7 million of this will be non-cash effective costs for share-based payments, pension accounting and depreciation. This guidance does not include any potential receipts from R&D collaborators.\n\nWith CHF 143.6 million in cash and short-term time deposits and no debt as of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to be funded into 2027, excluding any potential receipts from R&D collaborators.\n\nOn October 25, 2024, Molecular Partners announced the pricing of an underwritten offering in the US of 3’642’988 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing 3’642’988 ordinary shares at an offering price of USD 5.49 per ADS. The total gross proceeds amount to approximately USD 20 million. The offering included participation from a new investor HBM Healthcare Investments Ltd, which is a leading healthcare investor, as well as multiple existing investors. Leerink Partners and TD Cowen acted as joint bookrunning managers for the offering. LifeSci Capital acted as lead manager for the offering, and Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB) served as settlement agent. Molecular Partners currently intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with its existing cash and cash equivalents, for development and expansion of its radiopharmaceutical pipeline and platform (Radio-DARPin Therapeutics) and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Subsequent to the offering, the Company has (proforma) cash and short-term time deposits in the amount of CHF 158 million, with 40,363,095 issued shares.\n\n**Research & Development Highlights**\n\n**MP0712 and Radio-DARPin Therapy (RDT): Preparing for IND submission and clinical entry in 2025**\n\nMolecular Partners has leveraged the intrinsic properties of DARPins, such as small size, high affinity and specificity, to engineer Radio-DARPins as ideal vector candidates for radiopharmaceutical therapeutics and to create a Radio-DARPin Therapy (RDT) platform amenable to a broad range of tumor targets. Historically, small protein-based vectors faced challenges with kidney accumulation and toxicity, as well as suboptimal tumor uptake. Molecular Partners’ RDT platform addresses these limitations with its half-life extension technologies and surface engineering approaches, while preserving the advantages of the small protein format.\n\nMP0712 is a 212Pb-based Radio-DARPin Therapeutic (RDT) candidate targeting the tumor-associated protein delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3). MP0712 is being co-developed with Orano Med, a clinical stage pioneer of targeted alpha therapies using the lead isotope 212Pb. Molecular Partners and Orano Med anticipate initiating first-in-human studies in 2025, pending regulatory clearance. Initial clinical data of MP0712 is also anticipated in 2025.\n\nIn October 2024, Molecular Partners presented new _in vivo_ data at the EANM Congress. MP0712 demonstrated high affinity and specificity for DLL3 and a favorable safety profile. DLL3 is a highly relevant target for radiopharmaceutical therapy due to its abundant expression in tumors of patients with small cell lung cancer (present in >85% of tumors) and other aggressive neuroendocrine tumors, while expression in healthy tissues is low. MP0712 led to attractive tumor to kidney (T:K) ratios of >2 in biodistribution studies across several models, and to strong and dose-dependent efficacy in mice bearing established tumors with clinically-relevant levels of DLL3 expression and at a clinically-relevant dose.\n\nOn October 22, 2024, Molecular Partners and Orano Med signed a revised and strengthened agreement to co-develop 212Pb-based Radio-DARPin Therapeutics. This revision builds on the original agreement signed in January 2024. Under the revised agreement, both companies will co-develop four Radio-DARPin programs; each company will have the right to commercialize two programs (previously one each). Molecular Partners will hold commercialization rights to the second nominated Radio-DARPin candidate, in addition to rights to the first program MP0712.\n\nIn addition to the updates above, Molecular Partners continued to progress its RDT portfolio with projects through a partnership with Novartis, and is evaluating additional targets for RDT programs. An update on the broader RDT portfolio is expected to be shared in the first half of 2025.\n\n**_MP0533 (multispecific T cell engager)_**\n\nMP0533, a novel tetra-specific T cell-engaging DARPin, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome/AML (MDS/AML) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05673057). The trial is currently enrolling patients in Cohort 8. MP0533’s mode of action is designed to preferentially kill AML cells (blasts, leukemic progenitor and stem cells) that express any combination of the three cell surface antigens CD33, CD123, and CD70, while sparing healthy cells, which tend to express only one or none of these targets. The immune activation against the malignant cells is achieved through CD3-mediated T-cell engagement.\n\nAs shared in August 2024, MP0533 showed an acceptable tolerability profile with the majority of adverse events reported being infusion-related reactions and cytokine release syndrome. Based on this observed tolerability profile and initial antitumor activity data, and following discussion with treating physicians and key opinion leaders, Molecular Partners is amending the protocol to further increase dosing and improve the exposure profile of MP0533.\n\nMolecular Partners plans to present the next clinical update of the program at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in San Diego on December 7–10, 2024, and data following the protocol amendment are expected in 2025.\n\n**_Switch-DARPin Platform (next-gen immune cell engagers)_**\n\nThe Switch-DARPin platform provides a logic-gated “on/off” function (the “Switch”) to multi-specific DARPin candidates leading to target activation only in the presence of defined antigens. The objective is conditional activation of a targeted immune response.\n\nMP0621 is a Switch-DARPin candidate designed to induce killing of hematopoietic stem cells as a next-generation conditioning regimen for HSCT. The _in vivo_ proof-of-mechanism data, as presented at EHA 2024, demonstrate that MP0621 could be an efficient next-generation conditioning regimen for autologous HSCT. At present, the non-human primate data do not indicate that MP0621 would serve as a treatment for AML. As Molecular Partners’ portfolio strategy prioritizes therapeutic candidates for oncology, MP0621 is being evaluated for partnering. The Company plans to present a preclinical update on MP0621 at ASH 2024.\n\nProof-of-concept preclinical data on an additional Switch-DARPin candidate, namely a CD3 Switch-DARPin T cell engager for solid tumors, will be presented at SITC 2024 on November 9, 2024. The CD3 Switch-DARPin targets the highly validated immunostimulatory protein CD3 to deliver a T cell-engager (TCE) mechanism with enhanced function via engagement of additional receptors on the surface of T cells. TCEs are a powerful class of immuno-oncology therapies but have faced a range of challenges such as toxicity, poor T cell fitness and immune suppression, particularly in solid tumors. By employing a multi-specific Switch approach, Molecular Partners aims to broaden the therapeutic space for T cell engagers.\n\n**_MP0317 (localized agonist)_** MP0317 is a CD40 agonist designed to activate immune cells specifically within the tumor microenvironment (TME) by anchoring to fibroblast activation protein (FAP) which is expressed in high amounts around tumors. This tumor-localized approach has the potential to deliver greater efficacy with fewer side effects compared to systemic CD40-targeting therapies.\n\nIn September 2024, the Company presented details of the transcriptomic analysis from its completed Phase 1 study at CICON 2024. The analysis of patient biopsies pre- and post-treatment with MP0317 showed that this molecule remodels the tumor microenvironment by inducing infiltration of B, plasma, dendritic, and T follicular helper cells.\n\nMolecular Partners plans to share a comprehensive biomarker analysis of its completed Phase 1 study at SITC on November 9, 2024.\n\nThe positive Phase 1 data support further clinical evaluation of MP0317 in combination with complementary anticancer therapies and demonstrated the ability of the DARPin design to deliver on a targeted, tumor-localized CD40 activation mechanism. Molecular Partners is in discussion with leading academic centers regarding potential investigator-initiated combination trials.\n\n**Expected Financial Calendar**\n\nMarch 6, 2025| Corporate Highlights Q4 2024 and Key Financials for Full Year 2024  \n---|---  \nApril 16, 2025| Annual General Meeting  \nMay 15, 2025| Interim Management Statement Q1 2025  \n  \nThe latest timing of the above events can be viewed on [_the investor section_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cNEapypiMBeQDu13SXqgEdbGQH8zgky-KzrA3zPkPJCHVnmp_-TlXQiwEM3SFPIRkxAonEC0OlKYD8IBQSUHF2Da90xmqf5xf9kQjZea_sOFuJGuYdpWI3zWvCUmEV6mg78uuBO7NdqUtswPngntpw==) of the corporate website.\n\n**About DARPin Therapeutics** DARPin (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein) therapeutics are a new class of custom-built protein drugs based on natural binding proteins that open new dimensions of multi-functionality and multi-target specificity in drug design. The flexible architecture, intrinsic potential for high affinity and specificity, small size and high stability of DARPins offer benefits to drug design over other currently available protein-based therapeutics. DARPin candidates can be radically simple, with a single DARPin unit acting as the delivery vector to a specific target; or multispecific, with the possibility of engaging more than five targets, and combining multiple and conditional functionalities in a unique DARPin drug candidate. The DARPin platform is designed to be a rapid and cost-effective drug discovery engine, producing drug candidates with optimized properties and high production yields. DARPin therapeutics have been clinically validated across several therapeutic areas and developed through to the registrational stage.\n\n**About Molecular Partners** Molecular Partners AG is a clinical-stage biotech company pioneering the design and development of DARPin therapeutics for medical challenges other drug modalities cannot readily address. The Company has programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, with oncology as its main focus. Molecular Partners leverages the advantages of DARPins to provide unique solutions to patients through its proprietary programs as well as through partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies. Molecular Partners was founded in 2004 and has offices in both Zurich, Switzerland and Concord, MA, USA.
