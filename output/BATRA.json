Mixed-use development revenue is derived from The Battery Atlanta mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income. \n\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by segment and by source: \n\nThree months ended  |  Nine months ended   \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,  |  September 30,   \n2023  |  2024  |  % Change  |  2023  |  2024  |  % Change   \namounts in thousands  |  amounts in thousands   \nBaseball:   \nBaseball event  |  $  |  160,794  |  $  |  172,800  |  7  |  %  |  $  |  324,280  |  $  |  345,318  |  6  |  %   \nBroadcasting  |  69,337  |  70,992  |  2  |  %  |  138,786  |  144,043  |  4  |  %   \nRetail and licensing  |  20,904  |  16,512  |  (21  |  )%  |  45,026  |  41,789  |  (7  |  )%   \nOther  |  5,231  |  12,958  |  148  |  %  |  20,670  |  30,083  |  46  |  %   \nBaseball revenue  |  256,266  |  273,262  |  7  |  %  |  528,762  |  561,233  |  6  |  %   \nMixed-use development  |  15,558  |  17,412  |  12  |  %  |  44,157  |  49,397  |  12  |  %   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  271,824  |  $  |  290,674  |  7  |  %  |  $  |  572,919  |  $  |  610,630  |  7  |  %   \n  \nThere were 41 home games played in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37 home games in the prior year period. \n\nBaseball revenue increased 7% in the third quarter. Baseball event revenue increased primarily due to new sponsorship agreements and contractual rate increases on season tickets and existing sponsorship contracts. This was partially offset by reduced attendance at regular season home games. \n\nBroadcasting revenue was higher primarily due to an increase in the number of regular season games, as well as contractual rate increases. Retail and licensing revenue decreased due to a reduction in local revenue caused by reduced attendance at regular season home games. Other revenue increased due to additional concerts at the ballpark compared to the prior year period. Mixed-use development revenue increased 12% primarily due to higher parking revenue and increased rental income related to tenant recoveries. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA decreased in the third quarter due to increased baseball operating costs. Baseball operating costs increased due to higher major league player salaries as well as increases in MLB’s revenue sharing plan, minor league team and player expenses and concert related expenses. This was partially offset by decreases in variable concession and retail operating expenses due to reduced attendance at regular season home games. Selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in the third quarter. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  For a definition of Adjusted OIBDA (as defined by ABH) and the applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Disclosures,” below.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Important Notice:** Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc.

ABH defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges, if applicable. However, ABH’s definition of Adjusted OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. \n\nABH believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, ABH views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that ABH management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for ABH to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2024. \n\nThree months ended  |  Nine months ended   \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,  |  September 30,   \n_(amounts in thousands)_ |  2023  |  2024  |  2023  |  2024   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  15,716  |  $  |  6,402  |  $  |  (14,074  |  )  |  $  |  (21,017  |  )   \nStock-based compensation  |  3,309  |  6,365  |  9,653  |  13,789   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  21,286  |  18,678  |  55,215  |  50,669   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  40,311  |  $  |  31,445  |  $  |  50,794  |  $  |  43,441   \nBaseball  |  $  |  36,884  |  $  |  24,397  |  $  |  38,232  |  $  |  20,072   \nMixed-use development  |  10,661  |  12,173  |  29,980  |  33,615   \nCorporate and other  |  (7,234  |  )  |  (5,125  |  )  |  (17,418  |  )  |  (10,246  |  )   \n  \nSCHEDULE 2: Cash and Debt \n\nThe following presentation is provided to separately identify cash and debt information. ABH cash decreased $20 million during the third quarter due to cash used in operations primarily driven by seasonal working capital changes as well as capital expenditures, partially offset by the release of restricted cash pursuant to the terms of various financial debt arrangements and net borrowing. ABH debt increased $40 million in the third quarter primarily due to borrowings under the TeamCo revolver and mixed-use development credit facilities to support working capital and current capital projects. \n\n_(amounts in thousands)_ |  June 30, 2024  |  September 30, 2024   \n---|---|---  \n**ABH Cash (GAAP)(a)** |  **$** |  **121,239** |  **$** |  **100,852**  \n**Debt:**  \nBaseball   \nLeague wide credit facility  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —   \nMLB facility fund - term  |  30,000  |  30,000   \nMLB facility fund - revolver  |  40,250  |  39,675   \nTeamCo revolver  |  —  |  30,000   \nTerm debt  |  162,119  |  158,806   \nMixed-use development  |  370,908  |  384,641   \n**Total ABH Debt** |  **$** |  **603,277** |  **$** |  **643,122**  \nDeferred financing costs  |  (3,241  |  )  |  (3,023  |  )   \n**Total ABH Debt (GAAP)** |  **$** |  **600,036** |  **$** |  **640,099**  \n  \n___________________   \n---  \na)  |  Excludes restricted cash held in reserves pursuant to the terms of various financial obligations of $40 million and $15 million as of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, respectively.   \n  \n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION** **September 30, 2024 (unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**amounts in thousands,**  \n**except share amounts**  \n_Assets_  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  100,852  |  125,148   \nRestricted cash  |  15,168  |  12,569   \nAccounts receivable and contract assets, net of allowance for credit losses of $468 and $332, respectively  |  88,053  |  62,922   \nOther current assets  |  20,065  |  17,380   \nTotal current assets  |  224,138  |  218,019   \nProperty and equipment, at cost  |  1,159,685  |  1,091,943   \nAccumulated depreciation  |  (358,549  |  )  |  (325,196  |  )   \n801,136  |  766,747   \nInvestments in affiliates, accounted for using the equity method  |  113,929  |  99,213   \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization:   \nGoodwill  |  175,764  |  175,764   \nFranchise rights  |  123,703  |  123,703   \n299,467  |  299,467   \nOther assets, net  |  118,577  |  120,884   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  1,557,247  |  1,504,330   \n_Liabilities and Equity_  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities  |  $  |  92,525  |  73,096   \nDeferred revenue and refundable tickets  |  82,414  |  111,985   \nCurrent portion of debt  |  137,626  |  42,153   \nOther current liabilities  |  9,093  |  6,439   \nTotal current liabilities  |  321,658  |  233,673   \nLong-term debt  |  502,473  |  527,116   \nFinance lease liabilities  |  103,520  |  103,586   \nDeferred income tax liabilities  |  40,489  |  50,415   \nPension liability  |  11,007  |  15,222   \nOther noncurrent liabilities  |  35,633  |  33,676   \nTotal liabilities  |  1,014,780  |  963,688   \n_Equity:_  \nPreferred stock, $.01 par value.

Mixed-use development revenue is derived from The Battery Atlanta mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income. \n\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by segment and by source: \n\nThree months ended  |  Nine months ended   \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,  |  September 30,   \n2023  |  2024  |  % Change  |  2023  |  2024  |  % Change   \namounts in thousands  |  amounts in thousands   \nBaseball:   \nBaseball event  |  $  |  160,794  |  $  |  172,800  |  7  |  %  |  $  |  324,280  |  $  |  345,318  |  6  |  %   \nBroadcasting  |  69,337  |  70,992  |  2  |  %  |  138,786  |  144,043  |  4  |  %   \nRetail and licensing  |  20,904  |  16,512  |  (21  |  )%  |  45,026  |  41,789  |  (7  |  )%   \nOther  |  5,231  |  12,958  |  148  |  %  |  20,670  |  30,083  |  46  |  %   \nBaseball revenue  |  256,266  |  273,262  |  7  |  %  |  528,762  |  561,233  |  6  |  %   \nMixed-use development  |  15,558  |  17,412  |  12  |  %  |  44,157  |  49,397  |  12  |  %   \nTotal revenue  |  $  |  271,824  |  $  |  290,674  |  7  |  %  |  $  |  572,919  |  $  |  610,630  |  7  |  %   \n  \nThere were 41 home games played in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 37 home games in the prior year period. \n\nBaseball revenue increased 7% in the third quarter. Baseball event revenue increased primarily due to new sponsorship agreements and contractual rate increases on season tickets and existing sponsorship contracts. This was partially offset by reduced attendance at regular season home games. \n\nBroadcasting revenue was higher primarily due to an increase in the number of regular season games, as well as contractual rate increases. Retail and licensing revenue decreased due to a reduction in local revenue caused by reduced attendance at regular season home games. Other revenue increased due to additional concerts at the ballpark compared to the prior year period. Mixed-use development revenue increased 12% primarily due to higher parking revenue and increased rental income related to tenant recoveries. \n\nOperating income and Adjusted OIBDA decreased in the third quarter due to increased baseball operating costs. Baseball operating costs increased due to higher major league player salaries as well as increases in MLB’s revenue sharing plan, minor league team and player expenses and concert related expenses. This was partially offset by decreases in variable concession and retail operating expenses due to reduced attendance at regular season home games. Selling, general and administrative expenses were relatively flat in the third quarter. \n\n**FOOTNOTES**\n\n1)  |  For a definition of Adjusted OIBDA (as defined by ABH) and the applicable reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Disclosures,” below.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Important Notice:** Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc.

ABH defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges, if applicable. However, ABH’s definition of Adjusted OIBDA may differ from similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. \n\nABH believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance, ABH views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure, but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that ABH management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for ABH to operating income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2024. \n\nThree months ended  |  Nine months ended   \n---|---  \nSeptember 30,  |  September 30,   \n_(amounts in thousands)_ |  2023  |  2024  |  2023  |  2024   \nOperating income (loss)  |  $  |  15,716  |  $  |  6,402  |  $  |  (14,074  |  )  |  $  |  (21,017  |  )   \nStock-based compensation  |  3,309  |  6,365  |  9,653  |  13,789   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  21,286  |  18,678  |  55,215  |  50,669   \nAdjusted OIBDA  |  $  |  40,311  |  $  |  31,445  |  $  |  50,794  |  $  |  43,441   \nBaseball  |  $  |  36,884  |  $  |  24,397  |  $  |  38,232  |  $  |  20,072   \nMixed-use development  |  10,661  |  12,173  |  29,980  |  33,615   \nCorporate and other  |  (7,234  |  )  |  (5,125  |  )  |  (17,418  |  )  |  (10,246  |  )   \n  \nSCHEDULE 2: Cash and Debt \n\nThe following presentation is provided to separately identify cash and debt information. ABH cash decreased $20 million during the third quarter due to cash used in operations primarily driven by seasonal working capital changes as well as capital expenditures, partially offset by the release of restricted cash pursuant to the terms of various financial debt arrangements and net borrowing. ABH debt increased $40 million in the third quarter primarily due to borrowings under the TeamCo revolver and mixed-use development credit facilities to support working capital and current capital projects. \n\n_(amounts in thousands)_ |  June 30, 2024  |  September 30, 2024   \n---|---|---  \n**ABH Cash (GAAP)(a)** |  **$** |  **121,239** |  **$** |  **100,852**  \n**Debt:**  \nBaseball   \nLeague wide credit facility  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  —   \nMLB facility fund - term  |  30,000  |  30,000   \nMLB facility fund - revolver  |  40,250  |  39,675   \nTeamCo revolver  |  —  |  30,000   \nTerm debt  |  162,119  |  158,806   \nMixed-use development  |  370,908  |  384,641   \n**Total ABH Debt** |  **$** |  **603,277** |  **$** |  **643,122**  \nDeferred financing costs  |  (3,241  |  )  |  (3,023  |  )   \n**Total ABH Debt (GAAP)** |  **$** |  **600,036** |  **$** |  **640,099**  \n  \n___________________   \n---  \na)  |  Excludes restricted cash held in reserves pursuant to the terms of various financial obligations of $40 million and $15 million as of June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2024, respectively.   \n  \n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.** **CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION** **September 30, 2024 (unaudited)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** |  **December 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**amounts in thousands,**  \n**except share amounts**  \n_Assets_  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  $  |  100,852  |  125,148   \nRestricted cash  |  15,168  |  12,569   \nAccounts receivable and contract assets, net of allowance for credit losses of $468 and $332, respectively  |  88,053  |  62,922   \nOther current assets  |  20,065  |  17,380   \nTotal current assets  |  224,138  |  218,019   \nProperty and equipment, at cost  |  1,159,685  |  1,091,943   \nAccumulated depreciation  |  (358,549  |  )  |  (325,196  |  )   \n801,136  |  766,747   \nInvestments in affiliates, accounted for using the equity method  |  113,929  |  99,213   \nIntangible assets not subject to amortization:   \nGoodwill  |  175,764  |  175,764   \nFranchise rights  |  123,703  |  123,703   \n299,467  |  299,467   \nOther assets, net  |  118,577  |  120,884   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  1,557,247  |  1,504,330   \n_Liabilities and Equity_  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities  |  $  |  92,525  |  73,096   \nDeferred revenue and refundable tickets  |  82,414  |  111,985   \nCurrent portion of debt  |  137,626  |  42,153   \nOther current liabilities  |  9,093  |  6,439   \nTotal current liabilities  |  321,658  |  233,673   \nLong-term debt  |  502,473  |  527,116   \nFinance lease liabilities  |  103,520  |  103,586   \nDeferred income tax liabilities  |  40,489  |  50,415   \nPension liability  |  11,007  |  15,222   \nOther noncurrent liabilities  |  35,633  |  33,676   \nTotal liabilities  |  1,014,780  |  963,688   \n_Equity:_  \nPreferred stock, $.01 par value.

Financial Statements**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n**(1)** Basis of Presentation\n\nDuring November 2022, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty” or “Former parent”) authorized Liberty management to pursue a plan to redeem each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of a newly formed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was completed on July 18, 2023 and was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the transaction. Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (“Atlanta Braves Holdings”) is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities previously attributed to the Liberty Braves Group (“Braves Group”), which, as of September 30, 2024, included Atlanta Braves Holdings’ wholly-owned subsidiary Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) and corporate cash.\n\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements represent the combination of the historical financial information of the Braves Group until the date of the Split-Off. Although Atlanta Braves Holdings was reported as a combined company until the date of the Split-Off, all periods reported herein are referred to as consolidated. These financial statements refer to the consolidation of Braves Holdings, cash and intergroup interests in the Braves Group (prior to settlement/extinguishment) as \"Atlanta Braves Holdings,\" \"the Company,\" \"us,\" \"we\" and \"our\" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Split-Off was accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accompanying (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and (b) the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods have been included. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Additionally, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparability with current period presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Atlanta Braves Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers (i) fair value measurements of non-financial instruments and (ii) accounting for income taxes to be its most significant estimates.\n\nDescription of Business\n\nBraves Holdings indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”). ANLBC’s ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”), is located in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta, and is leased from Cobb County, Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority. Braves Holdings, through affiliated entities and third party development partners, has developed a significant portion of the land around Truist Park for a mixed-use development that features retail, office, hotel and entertainment opportunities (the “Mixed-Use Development”).\n\nI-10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nThe Braves and 29 other Major League baseball clubs are collectively referred to as the Clubs. The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (the “BOC”) is an unincorporated association also doing business as Major League Baseball (“MLB”) and has as its members the Clubs. The Clubs are bound by the terms and provisions of the Major League Constitution and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of a Club, which among other things, require each Club to comply with limitations on the amount of debt a Club can incur, revenue sharing arrangements with the other Clubs, commercial arrangements with regard to the national broadcasting of its games and other programming and commercial arrangements relating to the use of its intellectual property.\n\nSplit-Off of Atlanta Braves Holdings from Liberty \n\nPrior to the Split-Off, a portion of Liberty’s general and administrative expenses, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support was allocated to the Braves Group each reporting period based on an estimate of time spent. The Braves Group paid $4.5 million during 2023 prior to the Split-Off for such expenses.\n\nPrior to the Split-Off, the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty SiriusXM Group held intergroup interests in the Braves Group. The intergroup interests represented quasi-equity interests which were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed interests in the Braves Group, which were generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Liberty Braves common stock. As of December 31, 2022, 6,792,903 notional shares represented an 11.0% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Formula One Group and 1,811,066 notional shares represented a 2.9% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Historically, Liberty assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C Liberty Braves common stock and that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock. Therefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and Series A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interests held by the Formula One Group and the Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock would be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly, effective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of Series C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group.\n\nThe intergroup interests in the Braves Group remaining immediately prior to the Split-Off were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off through the attribution, to the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock on a one-for-one basis equal to the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest.\n\nFollowing the Split-Off and subsequent Liberty Media Exchange (as defined below), Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings operate as separate, publicly traded companies and neither has any continuing stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. Liberty owned 1,811,066 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock following the Split-Off. In November 2023, Liberty exchanged 1,811,066 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock with a third party in satisfaction of certain of Liberty’s debt obligations and an affiliate of such third party then sold the shares in a secondary public offering (the “Liberty Media Exchange”). Atlanta Braves Holdings did not receive any of the proceeds from the Liberty Media Exchange.\n\nI-11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nIn connection with the Split-Off, Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Split-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements included a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, aircraft time sharing agreements, a facilities sharing agreement, a tax sharing agreement and a registration rights agreement. The facilities sharing agreement and aircraft time sharing agreements were terminated as part of the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below).\n\nThe reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Split-Off, certain conditions to the Split-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Split-Off. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Atlanta Braves Holdings with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. Atlanta Braves Holdings will reimburse Liberty for direct, out-of-pocket expenses and will pay a services fee to Liberty under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment quarterly, as necessary. Additionally, pursuant to the services agreement with Liberty and prior to the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below), components of Liberty Chief Executive Officer’s compensation were either paid directly to him or reimbursed to Liberty, in each case, based on allocations set forth in the services agreement. The allocation percentage was 7% for Atlanta Braves Holdings during the period from July 18, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and was 8% during the period from January 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024, when the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below) occurred.\n\nPursuant to the registration rights agreement with Liberty, Atlanta Braves Holdings registered the shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings’ Series C common stock that were issued to Liberty in settlement and extinguishment of the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and then exchanged by Liberty with a third party in satisfaction of certain debt obligations.\n\nUnder these various agreements, amounts reimbursable to Liberty aggregated $1.6 million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 after the Split-Off.\n\nRelated Party Transactions and Change in Corporate Governance\n\nOn August 21, 2024, Terence F. McGuirk (“McGuirk”), Chairman and CEO of Braves Holdings, LLC, entered into certain shareholder arrangements with Dr. John Malone (“Malone”), pursuant to which Malone has granted McGuirk a proxy (the “Malone Voting Agreement”) to vote 887,079 shares of the Company’s Series B Common Stock owned by Malone, representing 44% of the Company’s outstanding voting power, on director elections, the approval or authorization of executive compensation and other routine matters. Malone has also granted McGuirk a right of first refusal with respect to future transfers of the Company shares beneficially owned by Malone as well as certain appreciation rights with respect to the value of Malone’s shares of Series B Common Stock.\n\nThe execution of the Malone Voting Agreement constituted a “Change in Control” of the Company as defined in Gregory B. Maffei’s Executive Employment Agreement, dated effective as of December 13, 2019, by and between Mr. Maffei and Liberty. As a result, on August 21, 2024, Mr. Maffei notified the Company of his resignation as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company effective August 31, 2024. Mr. Maffei’s separation from employment with the Company was for “Good Reason” within the meaning of his Executive Employment Agreement. Additionally, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty have begun transitioning various general and administrative services currently provided by Liberty to the management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the \n\nI-12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nthen-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024 (the “Corporate Governance Transition”).\n\nSeasonality\n\nBraves Holdings revenue is seasonal, with the majority of revenue recognized during the second and third quarters which aligns with the baseball season.\n\n**(2)** Earnings Attributable to Atlanta Braves Holdings Stockholders Per Common Share\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to Atlanta Braves Holdings shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (“WASO”) for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented. There were no potential common shares excluded from diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 that would have been antidilutive. Excluded from diluted EPS for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are 3 thousand potential common shares because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**|  ​| **September 30, 2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(numbers of shares in thousands)**|  ​  \nBasic WASO|  62,021| ​|  61,720| ​|  61,950| ​|  61,720| ​  \nPotentially dilutive shares (1)|  1,018| ​|  868| ​|  895| ​|  868| ​  \nDiluted WASO|  63,039| ​|  62,588| ​|  62,845| ​|  62,588| ​  \n  \n(1) Potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS during periods in which losses are reported since the result would be antidilutive.\n\n​\n\nI-13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n(3) Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Owned**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Owned**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Estimated**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **assets**|  ​| ​  \n​| ​| **Useful**|  ​| **Owned**|  ​| **available to**|  ​| ​| ​| **Owned**|  ​| **available to**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| **Life**| **assets**| **be leased**| **Total**| **assets**| **be leased**| **Total**  \n​| ​| **in years**|  ​| **amounts in thousands**  \nLand| NA| ​| $|  18,583| ​|  22,891|  41,474|  18,583| ​|  22,891|  41,474| ​  \nBuildings and improvements| 15-39| ​|  281,484| ​|  356,758|  638,242|  281,450| ​|  355,300|  636,750| ​  \nLeasehold improvements| 15-39| ​|  85,133| ​|  68,291|  153,424|  76,169| ​|  64,657|  140,826| ​  \nFurniture and equipment| 5-7| ​|  192,695| ​|  10,217|  202,912|  179,828| ​|  8,518|  188,346| ​  \nConstruction in progress| NA| ​|  772| ​|  122,861|  123,633|  4,911| ​|  79,636|  84,547| ​  \nProperty and equipment, at cost| ​| ​| ​| $|  578,667|  581,018|  1,159,685|  560,941|  531,002|  1,091,943| ​  \n  \n​\n\nDepreciation expense was $10.0 million and $13.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $33.6 million and $40.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n**(4)** Investments in Affiliates Accounted for Using the Equity Method\n\nThe following table includes the Company’s carrying amount and percentage ownership of its investments in affiliates:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30, 2024**|  ​| **December 31, 2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **Percentage**|  ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Carrying**|  ​  \n​| **Ownership**| **amount**| **amount**|  ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nMLBAM| ​| 3.3| % | $|  60,855| ​|  49,338| ​  \nBELP| ​| 3.3| % |  39,352| ​|  34,988| ​  \nOther| ​| 50.0| % |  13,722| ​|  14,887| ​  \nTotal| ​| ​| ​| $|  113,929| ​|  99,213| ​  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**  \nMLBAM| ​| $|  10,592|  9,797| ​|  19,283| ​|  19,131| ​  \nBELP| ​|  1,195|  739| ​|  4,364| ​|  1,450| ​  \nOther| ​|  1,915|  2,189| ​|  3,304| ​|  2,803| ​  \nTotal| ​| $|  13,702|  12,725| ​|  26,951|  23,384| ​  \n  \n​\n\nI-14\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nMLBAM\n\nMLB Advanced Media, L.P. (“MLBAM”) was formed in January 2000 pursuant to a vote of the 30 owners of the Clubs, whereby each Club agreed to cede substantially all of its individual Club internet and interactive media rights to MLBAM for an indirect 3.3% interest in MLBAM. The Company’s investment in MLBAM is considered an equity method investment as the investment is in a limited partnership where significant influence is generally presumed to exist. \n\nAt the time of the acquisition of ANLBC by a predecessor of Liberty in 2007, the fair value of the MLBAM investment exceeded ANLBC’s proportionate share of MLBAM’s net assets, resulting in excess basis in the investment in MLBAM. The excess basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was indefinite lived and aggregated approximately $10.3 million. \n\nBELP\n\nBaseball Endowment, L.P.

Braves Holdings also established a special purpose Delaware statutory trust, the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”), and transferred, among other things, to the Club Trust its rights to receive distributions of revenue from the National Broadcasting Contracts, which secure borrowings under the LWCF. Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow from certain lenders, with Bank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs. Major League Baseball Trust has granted Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, the collateral agent in respect of the LWCF, a first priority lien to secure the borrowings under the LWCF. The maximum amount available to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $125.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The commitment termination date of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such revolving credit facility, is July 10, 2026. \n\nUnder the LWCF, the Club Trust can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by the Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a Eurodollar loan was one-month London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of 1.20% to 1.325%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Trust. The interest rate of a Base Rate loan was the greater of (x) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (y) the prevailing Prime, and (z) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a margin of 0.200% to 0.325%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Trust. Beginning in May 2022, interest based on LIBOR under the LWCF was replaced with interest based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 0.1%. Borrowings outstanding under the LWCF bore interest at a rate of 6.15% per annum as of September 30, 2024. The LWCF also has a commitment fee equal to 0.20% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility.\n\nMLB Facility Fund\n\nIn December 2017, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into the MLB Facility Fund (the “MLBFF”). Braves Holdings also established a special purpose Delaware limited liability company, Braves Facility Fund LLC (“Braves Facility Fund”), and transferred to Braves Facility Fund its rights to receive distributions from the Club Trust, which secure borrowings under the MLBFF. Pursuant to the terms of an indenture, a credit agreement and certain note purchase agreements, Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC may borrow from certain lenders. Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to each of the participating Clubs. Amounts advanced pursuant to the MLBFF are available to fund ballpark and other baseball-related real property improvements, renovations and/or new construction.\n\nTerm\n\nIn June 2020, Braves Facility Fund converted previous borrowings under a revolving credit advance to a $30 million term note with Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC (the “MLB facility fund – term”). Interest is payable on June 10 and December 10 of each year at an annual rate of 3.65%. In each of December 2029 and 2030, $15 million of the term note matures.\n\nRevolver\n\nIn May 2021, Braves Facility Fund established a revolving credit commitment with Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC (the “MLB facility fund – revolver”). The maximum amount available to Braves Facility Fund under \n\nI-16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nthe MLB facility fund – revolver was $39.7 million as of September 30, 2024. The commitment termination date, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility of the MLBFF, is July 10, 2026.\n\nUnder a credit agreement, Braves Facility Fund can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by a Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a Eurodollar loan was one-month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.275% to 1.400%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC. The interest rate of a Base Rate loan was the greater of (x) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (y) the prevailing Prime rate, and (z) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a margin of 0.275% to 0.400%, based on the credit rating of Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC. Beginning in May 2022, interest based on LIBOR under the MLB facility fund – revolver was replaced with interest based on the SOFR plus 0.1%. Borrowings outstanding under the MLB facility fund – revolver bore interest at a rate of 6.22% per annum as of September 30, 2024. The MLB facility fund – revolver also has a commitment fee equal to 0.20% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolver.\n\nTeamCo Revolver\n\nIn September 2016, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings amended a revolving credit agreement (the “TeamCo Revolver”) that provided for revolving commitments of $85 million. Under the agreement, Braves Holdings can request a revolving credit loan in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by a Eurodollar or Base Rate, plus an applicable margin. The interest rate of a Base Rate loan was the greater of (x) the prevailing Prime rate, (y) the prevailing Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR plus 1.00%, plus a margin of 0.25%. In August 2022, the TeamCo Revolver was amended, increasing the borrowing capacity to $150 million, extending the maturity to August 2029 and replacing the LIBOR interest rate with SOFR. Borrowings outstanding under the TeamCo Revolver bore interest at a rate of 6.10% and had availability of $120.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The TeamCo Revolver also has a commitment fee of 0.20% per annum on the daily unused amount of the revolving loans. Under the TeamCo Revolver, Braves Holdings must maintain certain financial covenants, including a fixed-charge coverage ratio and total enterprise indebtedness.\n\nBaseball Term Debt\n\nIn August 2016, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into a senior secured permanent placement note purchase agreement for $200 million (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). The notes bear interest at 3.77% per annum and are scheduled to mature in September 2041. Braves Holdings makes principal and interest payments of $6.4 million each March 30 and September 30. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings of $157.5 million and $164.0 million under the Note Purchase Agreement, respectively, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. Additionally, Braves Holdings must maintain certain financial covenants, including debt service coverage ratios.\n\nMixed-Use Development Credit Facilities\n\nIn August 2016, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into a $37.5 million construction loan agreement that matures in November 2024. The proceeds were primarily used to pay the construction costs of an entertainment building adjacent to the Stadium, as well as assist with phase II construction of the Mixed-Use Development. Interest accrues monthly at 4% per annum. Beginning December 15, 2020 and on each month thereafter, Braves Holdings makes principal and interest payments of $179 thousand. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings outstanding of $34.1 million and $34.6 million, respectively, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n\nIn December 2022, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into a $112.5 million construction loan agreement that has an initial maturity date of December 2026. The proceeds of the construction loan agreement will be used to pay \n\nI-17\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nthe construction costs of an office building adjacent to the Stadium. Loans under the construction loan bear interest at SOFR plus 2.00% per annum (subject to a reduction to 1.80% per annum if certain conditions are met). Borrowings outstanding under the construction loan bore interest at a rate of 6.85% as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings outstanding of $84.4 million and $34.8 million, respectively, under the construction loan, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n\nUnder the construction loans, Braves Holdings must maintain certain financial covenants, including a debt yield ratio.\n\nMixed-Use Development Term Debt\n\nIn May 2018, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings refinanced a construction loan with a $95 million term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”). The Term Loan Agreement bore interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.35% per annum and is scheduled to mature on May 18, 2025. The full principal amount will be due at maturity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings of $95.0 million and $94.9 million, respectively, under the Term Loan Agreement, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. In April 2023, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to change the reference rate on borrowings to daily simple SOFR. \n\nIn June 2022, subsidiaries of Braves Holdings refinanced a construction loan agreement that was used to construct an office building within the Mixed-Use Development with a new term loan facility with $125 million in commitments, approximately $22.7 million of which is not available for borrowing as of September 30, 2024, but is expected to be available once certain conditions are met. The term loan agreement bears interest at one-month SOFR plus 2.10% per annum and is scheduled to mature on June 13, 2027. Borrowings outstanding under the term loan bore interest at a rate of 6.95% as of September 30, 2024. Approximately $1.7 million of annual principal payments commenced in July 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings outstanding of $101.3 million and $101.6 million, respectively, under the term loan facility, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n\nIn May 2023, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings refinanced an $80 million construction loan agreement that was used to construct the retail portion of the Mixed-Use Development with a new term loan with $80 million in commitments, approximately $11.3 million of which is not available for borrowing as of September 30, 2024, but is expected to be available once certain conditions are met. The term loan agreement bears interest at daily simple SOFR plus 2.50% per annum and is scheduled to mature on May 18, 2028. Approximately $1.0 million of annual principal payments commence in June 2026. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Braves Holdings had borrowings outstanding of $68.3 million and $68.2 million, respectively, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. \n\nFair Value of Debt\n\nThe Company believes that the carrying amount of its debt with variable rates approximates fair value at September 30, 2024. Other fixed rate debt is considered to be carried at approximate fair value with the exception of the senior secured permanent placement notes, which was estimated to be approximately $138 million as of September 30, 2024, based on current U.S. treasury rates for similar financial instruments.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps (Level 2)\n\nIn May 2018, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Truist Bank for a notional amount of $95 million, maturing on May 5, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset of $1.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively. \n\nI-18\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nIn August 2019, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Truist Bank for a notional amount of $100 million, that matured on March 8, 2023. Effective April 1, 2020, the notional amount began at $25 million and increased over time to $100 million as of August 1, 2020. \n\nIn May 2022, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Truist Bank for a notional amount of $100 million, maturing on June 1, 2025. Effective March 2023, the notional amount began at $100 million and decreased in June 2024 to $99.8 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the interest rate swap was an asset of $1.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\n\nIn June 2023, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Truist Bank for a notional amount of $64 million, maturing on May 18, 2028. The interest rate swap became effective in June 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of $906 thousand and $372 thousand, respectively.\n\nInterest rate swaps are included within other current assets and other noncurrent liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and other assets and other noncurrent liabilities as of December 31, 2023 in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded to realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\n​\n\n**(6)** Stock-Based Compensation \n\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $6.4 million and $3.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $13.8 million and $9.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nIncentive Plans\n\nPrior to the Split-Off and pursuant to the Liberty Media Corporation 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan, Liberty granted to certain of its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, restricted stock (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stock options to purchase shares of Liberty Braves common stock (collectively, “Awards”). At the time of the Split-Off, the Awards were exchanged into RSAs, RSUs and stock options to purchase shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock.\n\nSubsequent to the Split-Off, the Company can grant, to certain of its directors, employees and employees of its subsidiaries, RSAs, RSUs and stock options to purchase shares of its common stock, under the Atlanta Braves Holdings 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) and may grant Awards in respect of a maximum of 7.25 million shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock.\n\nAwards generally vest over 1-5 years and have a term of 7-10 years. The Company issues new shares upon exercise or settlement, as applicable, of Awards. The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity classified Award (such as RSAs, RSUs and stock options) based on the grant-date fair value (“GDFV”) of the Award, and recognizes that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service (usually the vesting period of the Award). The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for a liability classified Award based on the current fair value of the Award, and remeasures the fair value of the Award at each reporting date.\n\nI-19\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nGrants of Awards\n\nThe Company did not grant any options to purchase shares of Series A or Series B Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nIn connection with the Liberty Chief Executive Officer’s employment agreement, Liberty granted 35 thousand performance-based RSUs of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock to the Liberty Chief Executive Officer in March 2024. Such RSUs had a GDFV of $38.58 per share. In August 2024, and in connection with the Corporate Governance Transition, such RSUs were vested in full as to the target number of shares underlying such RSUs. \n\nThe Company has calculated the GDFV for all of its equity classified Awards using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Company estimates the expected term of the options based on historical exercise and forfeiture data. The volatility used in the calculation for Awards is based on the historical volatility of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock (and previously, Liberty Braves common stock). The Company uses a zero dividend rate and the risk-free rate for Treasury Bonds with a term similar to that of the subject options.\n\nOutstanding Awards\n\nThe following table presents the number and weighted average exercise price (“WAEP”) of options to purchase Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock granted to certain officers, employees and directors, as well as the weighted average remaining life and aggregate intrinsic value of the options.\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Series C**|  ​  \n​| ​| ​| **Weighted**| **Aggregate**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **average**|  ​| **intrinsic**  \n​| ​| **Atlanta Braves Holdings**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| **remaining**|  ​| **value**  \n​| **options (000's)**| **WAEP**| **life**| **(in millions)**|  ​  \nOutstanding at January 1, 2024|  3,502| $|  28.36| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nGranted|  —| $|  —| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nExercised|  (322)| $|  26.34| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nForfeited/Cancelled|  —| $|  —| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOutstanding at September 30, 2024|  3,180| $|  28.56|  3.6| years| $|  36| ​  \nExercisable at September 30, 2024|  2,697| $|  26.97|  3.1| years| $|  35| ​  \n  \n​\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding Series A or Series B options to purchase shares of Series A or Series B Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Atlanta Braves Holdings Awards was approximately $11.1 million. Such amount will be recognized in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, 3.2 million shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock were reserved by the Company for issuance under exercise privileges of outstanding stock options.\n\nExercises\n\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of all Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\n\nI-20\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nRSAs and RSUs\n\nThe Company had approximately 415 thousand unvested RSUs of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock held by certain directors, officers and employees of the Company as of September 30, 2024. These Series C unvested RSUs of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock had a weighted average GDFV of $37.15 per share.\n\nThe aggregate fair value of all RSAs and RSUs of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $6.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\n\n**(7)** Commitments and Contingencies\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreement\n\nIn March 2022, the Major League Baseball Players Association (“MLBPA”) and the Clubs entered into a new collective bargaining agreement that covers the 2022-2026 MLB seasons (“CBA”). The CBA contains provisions surrounding revenue sharing among the Clubs, a competitive balance tax on Club payrolls that exceed specified thresholds, minimum player salary levels, an expanded postseason schedule and other provisions impacting Braves Holdings’ operations and its relationships with members of the MLBPA. Braves Holdings’ minor league players are also parties to a collective bargaining agreement. Less than 10% of the Company’s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThere are two components of the revenue sharing plan that each Club is subject to under the CBA: a straight base revenue pool (the “Pool”) and the Commissioner Discretionary Fund. The size of the Pool is equal to the total amount transferred if each Club contributed 48% of its prior years’ net defined local revenue (“NDLR”). The contributions per Club are based on a composite of the prior three years’ NDLR and funds are distributed equally to all Clubs. Certain Clubs are disqualified from revenue sharing from the Pool based on market size. Club submissions of NDLR are subject to audit by the MLB Revenue Sharing Administrator and are subject to rules issued by the MLB Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Braves Holdings incurred $43.6 million and $31.8 million, respectively, in revenue sharing, which is included as an expense within baseball operating costs in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nEmployment Contracts\n\nLong-term employment contracts provide for, among other items, annual compensation for certain players (current and former) and other employees. As of September 30, 2024, amounts payable annually under such contracts aggregated $277.1 million in 2024, $218.9 million in 2025, $174.8 million in 2026, $111.7 million in 2027, $105.2 million in 2028 and $146.3 million, combined, thereafter. Additionally, these contracts may include incentive compensation (although certain incentive compensation awards cannot be earned by more than one player per season).\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, Braves Holdings entered into certain assignment agreements with long-term employment contracts which increased amounts payable by approximately $9.3 million and is anticipated to be paid through 2027 according to the terms of such contracts, excluding any incentive compensation.\n\nI-21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nDiamond Sports Group, LLC (“Diamond Sports Group”) Bankruptcy \n\nANLBC has a long-term local broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC, a subsidiary of Diamond Sports Group, granting its regional cable networks the right to broadcast substantially all of the Braves games not otherwise selected for broadcast within the home television territory of the Braves (“Braves Broadcast Agreement”). In March 2023, Diamond Sports Group along with certain affiliates (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 (“Chapter 11 Proceeding”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”).\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order among the Debtors, ANLBC and certain other MLB Clubs who have broadcast agreements with Diamond Sports Group or its affiliates, and the BOC, whereby the Debtors agreed not to reject or cause the termination of various club broadcasting agreements, including the Braves Broadcast Agreement, before the end of the 2024 MLB Season (“Agreed Order”). The Agreed Order provides other protections to ANLBC, MLB and the other covered Clubs to give some assurance that the Debtors will pay all required fees under the various club broadcasting agreements, including the Braves Broadcast Agreement, until the earlier to occur of (i) a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtors exit bankruptcy and (ii) the final payment for the 2024 MLB season is paid.\n\nThe Debtors filed their Disclosure Statement (“Disclosure Statement”) and Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Joint Plan of Reorganization”) on April 17, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement and originally scheduled a hearing to consider confirmation of the Joint Plan of Reorganization for June 18, 2024 (“Confirmation Hearing”). The Confirmation Hearing was originally adjourned to July 29-30, 2024, but on July 24, 2024, the Confirmation Hearing was further adjourned indefinitely. On September 3, 2024, the Debtors announced their intention to further amend the Disclosure Statement and Joint Plan of Reorganization in hopes of setting the Confirmation Hearing for some time in November. On October 2, 2024, the Debtors filed their First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (“Amended Plan”) as well as their Disclosure Statement Supplement for the Debtors’ First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (“Disclosure Statement Supplement”). The Debtors filed a further revised version of the Amended Plan (“Revised Amended Plan”) on October 9, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the Court approved the Disclosure Statement Supplement and scheduled the Confirmation Hearing to consider the Revised Amended Plan for November 14-15, 2024. Such dates are subject to further change. \n\nThe Debtors have indicated that their preference and intention is to proceed with a reorganization, but the Revised Amended Plan includes a feature that would allow the Debtors to pivot from a reorganization to a liquidation. The treatment of the Braves Broadcast Agreement is likely to be very different if the Debtors elect to pivot to a liquidation scenario under the Revised Amended Plan. If the Debtors proceed with a reorganization, the Debtors have indicated they intend to seek assumption of the obligations under the Braves Broadcast Agreement. If the Revised Amended Plan is confirmed and the Bankruptcy Court allows the Debtors to assume the Braves Broadcast Agreement, both ANLBC and Sportsouth Network II, LLC will continue to be responsible for their respective obligations under the Braves Broadcast Agreement. Alternatively, in the event the Debtors pivot to a liquidation, the Revised Amended Plan provides that the Debtors will seek to reject the Braves Broadcast Agreement thereby relieving the Debtors of any further performance obligations. The Revised Amended Plan currently provides that the Debtors have until December 16, 2024 to elect to pivot to a liquidation. Such date is subject to further change, including pursuant to a further amendment to the Revised Amended Plan or a court order.\n\nIn the event Diamond Sports Group is unsuccessful in its efforts to confirm the Revised Amended Plan or other plan of reorganization, it is possible that the respective bankruptcy cases of the Debtors could be converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. In such event, a trustee will be appointed to liquidate the remaining assets of the Debtors and ANLBC may be required to repay up to $34.2 million, the amount remitted to ANLBC during the 90-day preference \n\nI-22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nperiod preceding the filing. In addition, if the broadcasting agreement is rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding, ANLBC will not receive any revenue from Sportsouth Network II, LLC during the remaining contract term and ANLBC would be required to write-down accounts receivable and contract assets of approximately $35.6 million recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. In addition, a Chapter 7 trustee may reject the Braves Broadcast Agreement which would relieve the Debtors’ bankruptcy estate from its obligations under the agreement.\n\nTo date and throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding, ANLBC has received all scheduled payments in accordance with the Braves Broadcast Agreement.\n\nLitigation\n\nBraves Holdings, along with the BOC and other MLB affiliates, has been named in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. Although it is reasonably possible the Company may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. \n\n**(8)** Segment Information\n\nThe Company, through its ownership of Braves Holdings, is primarily engaged in the entertainment and real estate industries. The Company identifies its reportable segments as those operating segments that represent 10% or more of its consolidated annual revenue, annual Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets.\n\nThe Company evaluates performance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below). In addition, the Company reviews nonfinancial measures such as attendance, viewership and social media.\n\nThe Company has identified the following as its reportable segments:\n\n●| Baseball – operations relating to Braves baseball and Truist Park and includes ticket sales, concessions, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, broadcasting rights, retail and licensing.  \n---|---  \n●| Mixed-Use Development – includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery Atlanta.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed separately because each segment requires different technologies, differing revenue sources and marketing strategies.\n\nI-23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nPerformance Measures\n\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by segment and by source:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nBaseball:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBaseball event| $|  172,800| ​|  160,794| ​|  345,318| ​| 324,280 | ​  \nBroadcasting|  70,992| ​|  69,337| ​|  144,043| ​|  138,786| ​  \nRetail and licensing|  16,512| ​|  20,904| ​|  41,789| ​|  45,026| ​  \nOther|  12,958| ​|  5,231| ​|  30,083| ​|  20,670| ​  \nTotal Baseball|  273,262| ​|  256,266| ​|  561,233| ​|  528,762| ​  \nMixed-Use Development|  17,412| ​|  15,558| ​|  49,397| ​|  44,157| ​  \nTotal revenue| $|  290,674| ​|  271,824| ​|  610,630| ​|  572,919| ​  \n  \n​\n\nWhen consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract, deferred revenue is recorded. The primary source of the Company’s deferred revenue relates to suite and season ticket arrangements, as well as certain sponsorship arrangements. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the products or services are transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company had long-term deferred revenue of $17.9 million and $16.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were included in other noncurrent liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $99.5 million and $88.2 million, respectively, of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective year.\n\nSignificant portions of the transaction prices for Braves Holdings are related to undelivered performance obligations that are under contractual arrangements that extend beyond one year. The Company anticipates recognizing revenue from the delivery of such performance obligations of approximately $25.8 million for the remainder of 2024, $340.9 million in 2025, $311.9 million in 2026, $521.9 million in 2027 through 2031, and $134.1 million thereafter, primarily recognized through 2041. We have not included any amounts in the undelivered performance obligations amounts for those performance obligations that relate to a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less.\n\nFor segment reporting purposes, the Company defines Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses excluding all stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses, by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nI-24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**ATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nBaseball| $|  24,397|  36,884| ​|  20,072|  38,232| ​  \nMixed-Use Development| ​| ​|  12,173|  10,661| ​|  33,615|  29,980| ​  \nCorporate and Other| ​| ​|  (5,125)|  (7,234)| ​|  (10,246)|  (17,418)| ​  \nTotal| $|  31,445|  40,311| ​|  43,441|  50,794| ​  \n  \n​\n\nOther Information\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30, 2024**|  ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| **Total**| **Investments**| **Capital**| **Total**| **Investments**| **Capital**  \n​| ​| **assets**|  ​| **in affiliates**|  ​| **expenditures**|  ​| **assets**|  ​| **in affiliates**|  ​| **expenditures**  \n​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nBaseball| $| 908,484 |  100,207| ​|  17,266| ​| 882,442 |  84,326| ​|  12,152| ​  \nMixed-Use Development| ​| ​| 604,774 |  13,722| ​|  56,656| ​| 571,586 |  14,887| ​|  56,884| ​  \nCorporate and other| ​| ​| 46,099 |  —|  —|  51,256| —|  —| ​  \nElimination (1)| ​| ​|  (2,110)| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​|  (954)| ​|  —| ​|  —| ​  \nTotal| $|  1,557,247|  113,929|  73,922|  1,504,330|  99,213|  69,036| ​  \n(1)| This amount relates to income taxes payable that partially offsets income taxes receivable in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.   \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) before income taxes:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nAdjusted OIBDA| $|  31,445|  40,311| ​|  43,441|  50,794| ​  \nStock-based compensation| ​| ​|  (6,365)|  (3,309)| ​|  (13,789)|  (9,653)| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​| ​|  (18,678)|  (21,286)| ​|  (50,669)|  (55,215)| ​  \nOperating income (loss)| ​| ​|  6,402|  15,716| ​|  (21,017)|  (14,074)| ​  \nInterest expense| ​| ​|  (9,561)|  (9,657)| ​|  (28,717)|  (28,017)| ​  \nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates, net| ​| ​|  13,702|  12,725| ​|  26,951|  23,384| ​  \nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net| ​| ​|  —| ​|  (20,392)| ​|  —| ​|  (83,178)| ​  \nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net| ​| ​|  (2,476)|  2,593| ​|  1,429|  5,672| ​  \nOther, net| ​| ​|  1,838|  1,224| ​|  5,824|  5,381| ​  \nEarnings (loss) before income taxes| $|  9,905|  2,209| ​|  (15,530)|  (90,832)| ​  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nI-25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n**Explanatory Note**\n\nDuring November 2022, the board of directors of Liberty authorized Liberty management to pursue a plan to redeem each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of a newly formed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was completed on July 18, 2023 and was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the transaction. Atlanta Braves Holdings is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities previously attributed to the Liberty Braves Group (“Braves Group”), which, as of September 30, 2024, included Atlanta Braves Holdings’ wholly-owned subsidiary Braves Holdings and corporate cash. Although Atlanta Braves Holdings was reported as a combined company until the date of the Split-Off, all periods reported herein are referred to as consolidated.\n\nThe intergroup interests in the Braves Group held by the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty SiriusXM Group immediately prior to the Split-Off were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off through the attribution, to the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock on a one-for-one basis equal to the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest. \n\nOn August 21, 2024, Terence F. McGuirk (“McGuirk”), Chairman and CEO of Braves Holdings, LLC, entered into certain shareholder arrangements with Dr. John Malone (“Malone”), pursuant to which Malone has granted McGuirk a proxy (the “Malone Voting Agreement”) to vote 887,079 shares of the Company’s Series B Common Stock owned by Malone, representing 44% of the Company’s outstanding voting power, on director elections, the approval or authorization of executive compensation and other routine matters. Malone has also granted McGuirk a right of first refusal with respect \n\nI-27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nto future transfers of the Company shares beneficially owned by Malone as well as certain appreciation rights with respect to the value of Malone’s shares of Series B Common Stock.\n\nThe execution of the Malone Voting Agreement constituted a “Change in Control” of the Company as defined in Gregory B. Maffei’s Executive Employment Agreement, dated effective as of December 13, 2019, by and between Mr. Maffei and Liberty. As a result, on August 21, 2024, Mr. Maffei notified the Company of his resignation as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and a director of the Company effective August 31, 2024. Mr. Maffei’s separation from employment with the Company was for “Good Reason” within the meaning of his Executive Employment Agreement. Additionally, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty have begun transitioning various general and administrative services currently provided by Liberty to the management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the then-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024. (the “Corporate Governance Transition”).\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Company manages its business based on the following reportable segments: baseball and mixed-use development.\n\nThe baseball segment includes operations relating to the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”) and the Braves’ ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”) and includes revenue generated from ticket sales, concessions, local broadcasting rights, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, retail and licensing revenue, shared MLB revenue streams, including national broadcasting rights and licensing, and other sources. Ticket sales, concessions, broadcasting rights and advertising sponsorship sales are the baseball segment’s primary revenue drivers.\n\nThe Braves have a long-term local television broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC. Diamond Sports Group, the parent company of Sportsouth Network II, LLC, is in financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 protection. Refer to note 7 in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements and the _Liquidity and Capital Resources_ section below for more information.\n\nThe mixed-use development segment includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery Atlanta (the “Mixed-Use Development”). The Mixed-Use Development derives revenue primarily from office and retail rental income (including overage rent and tenant reimbursements) and, to a lesser extent, parking and advertising sponsorships throughout the year.\n\nI-28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Results of Operations –September 30, 2024 and 2023**\n\nGeneral. Provided in the tables below is information regarding the historical Condensed Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense of Atlanta Braves Holdings, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments. The “corporate and other” category consists of those assets that do not qualify as a separate reportable segment. \n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n​| **dollar amounts in thousands**  \nBaseball revenue| $|  273,262|  256,266| ​|  561,233|  528,762| ​  \nMixed-Use Development revenue|  17,412|  15,558| ​|  49,397|  44,157| ​  \nTotal revenue|  290,674|  271,824| ​|  610,630|  572,919| ​  \nOperating costs and expenses:| ​| ​  \nBaseball operating costs|  (225,973)|  (198,195)| ​|  (476,250)|  (430,424)| ​  \nMixed-Use Development costs|  (2,499)|  (2,247)| ​|  (7,162)|  (6,451)| ​  \nSelling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation| ​|  (30,757)| ​|  (31,071)| ​|  (83,777)| ​|  (85,250)| ​  \nStock-based compensation| ​|  (6,365)| ​|  (3,309)| ​|  (13,789)| ​|  (9,653)| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization|  (18,678)|  (21,286)| ​|  (50,669)|  (55,215)| ​  \nOperating income (loss)|  6,402|  15,716| ​|  (21,017)|  (14,074)| ​  \nOther income (expense):| ​| ​  \nInterest expense|  (9,561)|  (9,657)| ​|  (28,717)|  (28,017)| ​  \nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates, net|  13,702|  12,725| ​|  26,951|  23,384| ​  \nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net| ​|  —| ​|  (20,392)| ​|  —| ​|  (83,178)| ​  \nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net|  (2,476)|  2,593| ​|  1,429|  5,672| ​  \nOther, net|  1,838|  1,224| ​|  5,824|  5,381| ​  \nEarnings (loss) before income taxes|  9,905|  2,209| ​|  (15,530)|  (90,832)| ​  \nIncome tax benefit (expense)|  115|  (8,256)| ​|  3,387|  (2,104)| ​  \nNet earnings (loss)| $|  10,020|  (6,047)| ​|  (12,143)|  (92,936)| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAdjusted OIBDA| ​|  31,445| ​|  40,311| ​|  43,441| ​|  50,794| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nRegular season home games| ​|  41| ​|  37| ​|  81| ​|  80| ​  \nAverage number of attendees per regular season home game| ​|  26,159| ​|  32,481| ​|  28,469| ​|  32,521| ​  \n  \nBaseball revenue.

Broadcasting revenue increased $1.7 million and $5.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of regular season games, as well as contractual rate increases. Retail and licensing revenue decreased $4.4 million and $3.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in local revenue due to the decrease in regular season home game attendance and demand for City Connect and other apparel, partially offset by higher league-wide revenue. Other revenue, a component of baseball revenue, increased $7.7 million and $9.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to additional concerts at the Stadium. Additionally, the increase to the nine month period was due to spring training related revenue (ticket sales, concession revenue and other gameday related revenue) driven by increased attendance at spring training home games.\n\nMixed-Use Development revenue.Mixed-Use Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income and to a lesser extent, parking revenue and sponsorships. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mixed-Use Development revenue increased $1.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to $0.9 million and $2.5 million increases in parking revenue, respectively, and $0.7 million and $2.3 million increases in rental income, respectively. Increases in rental income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily driven by increases in tenant recoveries.\n\nBaseball operating costs. Baseball operating costs primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, baseball operating expenses increased $27.8 million and $45.8 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to $16.8 million and $26.3 million increases in major league player salaries, respectively, $6.9 million and $11.4 million increases in MLB’s revenue sharing plan, as well as other shared expenses, respectively, $2.5 million and $2.4 million increases in concert related expenses, respectively, and $2.1 million and $6.1 million increases in minor league team and player expenses, respectively, partially offset by $1.7 million and $4.6 million decreases in variable concession and retail operating expenses due to reduced attendance at regular season home games during 2024.\n\nMixed-Use Development costs.Mixed-Use Development costsprimarily include costs associated with maintaining and operating the mixed-use facilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mixed-Use Development costs increased $0.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to general repair expenses and other various operating increases.\n\nSelling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation.Selling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.3 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to reduced transaction costs related to the Split-Off, partly offset by increased personnel, insurance, information technology and professional fees.\n\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation increased $3.1 million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, mainly due to accelerated vesting for various awards in connection with the Corporate Governance Transition.\n\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.6 million and $4.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to various assets becoming fully depreciated.\n\nOperating income (loss).Operating income (loss) declined $9.3 million and $6.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to the above explanations.\n\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted OIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income \n\nI-30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nOperating income (loss)| ​| $|  6,402|  15,716| ​|  (21,017)|  (14,074)| ​  \nStock-based compensation| ​| ​|  6,365|  3,309| ​|  13,789|  9,653| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​| ​|  18,678|  21,286| ​|  50,669|  55,215| ​  \nAdjusted OIBDA| $|  31,445|  40,311| ​|  43,441|  50,794| ​  \n  \n​\n\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| ​| **2024**|  ​| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**|  ​  \nBaseball| $|  24,397|  36,884| ​|  20,072|  38,232| ​  \nMixed-Use Development| ​| ​|  12,173|  10,661| ​|  33,615|  29,980| ​  \nCorporate and Other| ​| ​|  (5,125)|  (7,234)| ​|  (10,246)|  (17,418)| ​  \nTotal| $|  31,445|  40,311| ​|  43,441|  50,794| ​  \n  \n​\n\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $8.9 million and $7.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.\n\nBaseball Adjusted OIBDA was decreased $12.5 million and $18.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to the fluctuations in baseball revenue and operating costs, as described above.\n\nMixed-Use Development Adjusted OIBDA increased $1.5 million and $3.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to the fluctuations in Mixed-Use Development revenue and costs, as described above.\n\nCorporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA loss decreased $2.1 million and $7.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to decreased costs related to the Split-Off.\n\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was relatively flat and increased $0.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased interest rates on the Company’s variable rate debt.\n\nI-31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates. The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three months ended**|  ​| **Nine months ended**  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n​| ​| **amounts in thousands**  \nMLB Advanced Media, L.P.| ​| $|  10,592|  9,797| ​|  19,283|  19,131| ​  \nBaseball Endowment, L.P.| ​|  1,195|  739| ​|  4,364|  1,450| ​  \nOther| ​|  1,915|  2,189| ​|  3,304|  2,803| ​  \nTotal| ​| $|  13,702|  12,725| ​|  26,951|  23,384| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net. As the notional shares underlying the intergroup interests were not represented by outstanding shares of common stock, such shares had not been officially designated Series A, B or C Liberty Braves common stock. However, Liberty historically assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C Liberty Braves common stock and the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock. Therefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and Series A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interests held by Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock would be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly, effective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of Series C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net were driven by changes in the market prices of Liberty Braves common stock. As disclosed above, the intergroup interests were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off. \n\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net are comprised of changes in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swaps driven by changes in interest rates.\n\nOther, net. Other, net income increased $0.6 million and $0.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to increases in dividend and interest income, partly offset by decreased gains on dispositions for the nine month period.\n\nIncome taxes. The Company’s tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\n\nIn 2024, our effective tax rate will be affected by state income taxes and the adverse effect of certain non-deductible expenses for which we may not realize a tax benefit.\n\nIn 2023, our effective tax rate was significantly affected by the unfavorable impact of intergroup interest losses that were not deductible for tax purposes and the effect of state income taxes.\n\nNet earnings (loss). The Company had net earnings of $10.0 million and net losses of $6.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of $12.1 million and $92.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net earnings (loss) was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\n\nI-32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $100.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.\n\nBraves Holdings is in compliance with all financial debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s primary uses of cash were capital expenditures and debt service, funded primarily by cash from operations and new borrowings on construction loans.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s primary uses of cash were capital expenditures and debt service, funded primarily by cash from operations and new borrowings on construction loans.\n\nThe Company’s uses of cash are expected to be payments to certain players, coaches and executives pursuant to long-term employment agreements, capital expenditures, investments in real estate ventures and debt service payments. The Company expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and through borrowings under construction loans and revolvers. We believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\n\nThe Braves have a long-term local television broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC. Diamond Sports Group, LLC, the parent company of Sportsouth Network II, LLC, is in financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 protection. While the pending bankruptcy proceeding of Diamond Sports Group, LLC has not previously had a material unfavorable impact on the Company’s revenue and the Company has received scheduled payments to date, we cannot currently predict whether such bankruptcy proceeding is reasonably likely to have a material unfavorable impact on our revenue and liquidity in the future.\n\nSources of Liquidity\n\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by Braves Holdings’ operating activities (to the extent such cash exceeds Braves Holdings’ working capital needs and is not otherwise restricted), net proceeds from asset sales, debt borrowings under the LWCF, the MLBFF and the TeamCo Revolver (each as defined below) and dividend and interest receipts.\n\n_League Wide Credit Facility_\n\nIn December 2013, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into MLB’s League Wide Credit Facility (the “LWCF”). Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow from certain lenders, with Bank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs, including the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”). The maximum amount available to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $125.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which remains undrawn. The commitment termination date of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such revolving credit facility, is July 10, 2026.\n\n_MLB Facility Fund Revolver_\n\nIn December 2017, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into the MLB Facility Fund (the “MLBFF”). Pursuant to the terms of an indenture, a credit agreement and certain note purchase agreements, Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC may borrow from certain lenders. Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to provide loans to each of the participating Clubs. Amounts advanced pursuant to the MLBFF are available to fund ballpark and other baseball-related real property improvements, renovations and/or new construction. In May 2021, Braves Facility Fund LLC established a revolving credit commitment with Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC (the “MLB facility fund — revolver”). The commitment termination date, which is the \n\nI-33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nrepayment date for all amounts borrowed under the MLB facility fund — revolver, is July 10, 2026. The maximum amount available to Braves Facility Fund LLC under the MLB facility fund — revolver was $39.7 million and was fully drawn as of September 30, 2024. \n\n_TeamCo Revolver_\n\nA subsidiary of Braves Holdings is party to a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “TeamCo Revolver”), which provides revolving commitments of $150 million and matures in August 2029. The availability under the TeamCo Revolver as of September 30, 2024 was $120.0 million, net of $30 million drawn as of September 30, 2024.\n\nSee note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of all indebtedness obligations.\n\n**Item 3.****Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**\n\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the conduct of operations. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.\n\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed and floating rate debt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to interest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from interest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term to maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap arrangements when we deem appropriate.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $161.9 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.6% and $481.2 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%.\n\n​\n\n**Item 4. Controls and Procedures**\n\nIn accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer (the \"Executives\"), and under the oversight of its board of directors, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.\n\nEffective September 1, 2024, as described in footnote 1 of this quarterly report, Liberty began transitioning certain general and administrative services previously provided by Liberty to the new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the then-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and certain members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024. As a result of the transition, internal controls over financial reporting are materially changing as executive oversight transitions to the new Atlanta Braves Holdings officers and the new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings begin to perform certain accounting, financial reporting, treasury, tax and entity level internal controls over financial reporting previously performed by members of Liberty management. We expect the \n\nI-34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nimpacted processes to remain generally consistent through the transition to the new control operators, and other than the transition of these internal controls over financial reporting to new process and control operators, the existing control environment is not materially changing. The transition of the internal controls over financial reporting has begun and should generally be completed with the 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2024. \n\n​\n\n​\n\nI-35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\n\n**Item 1. Legal Proceedings**\n\nRefer to note 7 in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Item 1A. Risk Factors**\n\nExcept as discussed below, there have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAs we begin transitioning away from services previously provided by Liberty, we may fail to replicate or replace certain functions, systems and infrastructure in a timely fashion, or at all, and may lose benefits from Liberty’s global contracts. \n\nHistorically, we have received services from Liberty, including through shared services contracts with various third-party service providers. Under the Services Agreement, Liberty has agreed to continue to provide us with certain services and support that were historically provided to us by or through Liberty prior to the Split-Off. The Services Agreement does not continue indefinitely and services provided under the Services Agreement generally terminate at various times specified in the agreement and the schedules thereto. We have begun transitioning away from certain services previously provided under the Services Agreement. For instance, Liberty previously provided some of its executive officers to serve as executive officers of the Company. As previously disclosed, as part of the transition of various general and administrative services provided by Liberty under the Services Agreement, on August 31, 2024, all of the officers of the Company previously provided by Liberty (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, and members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective as of September 1, 2024. These transitions included appointing a new chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, chief culture officer and executive vice presidents of the Company.\n\nWe are working to replicate or replace the services, and associated systems and data, and information security and cybersecurity procedures and systems, that we will continue to need in the operation of our business that have been provided by or through Liberty, including those we receive through shared service contracts Liberty has with various third-party providers or through the Services Agreement for applicable transitional periods. As a result, when Liberty ceases to provide these services to us, either as a result of the termination of the Services Agreement or individual services thereunder, our costs of performing or procuring these services or comparable replacement services could increase. In addition, we have historically received certain informal support from Liberty, including communications, technical support, market intelligence and market data, which may not be addressed in our transition plans. The level of this informal support may be eliminated following the termination of the Services Agreement.\n\nFurthermore, in connection with our efforts to replicate or replace these services, certain third-party systems we are using may have imbedded risks such as cybersecurity susceptibility that we may not be able to resolve effectively or efficiently. As a result, we may need to purchase comparable replacement services on less favorable commercial and legal terms, and the cessation of such services could result in service interruptions and divert management attention from other aspects of our operations, including ongoing efforts to implement technological developments and innovations. \n\nWe are also making infrastructure investments and hiring additional employees to operate without the same access to Liberty’s existing operational and administrative infrastructure. We have established or expanded our own tax, treasury, internal audit, accounting, investor relations, cybersecurity, corporate governance and listed company compliance and other corporate functions. Due to the scope and complexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts, we have been incurring and expect to continue to incur one-time costs to replicate, or outsource from other providers, these corporate functions to replace the corporate services that Liberty historically provided us prior to the Split-Off and under the Services Agreement. The amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate, and the timing of the incurrence of these costs may be subject to change. \n\nII-1\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds**\n\nThere were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, zero shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series A common stock, zero shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series B common stock and 269 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock were surrendered by our officers and employees to pay withholding taxes and other deductions in connection with the vesting or exercise of restricted stock.\n\n**Item 5. Other Information**\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following Section 16 officers adopted, modified, or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):\n\n​\n\n●| Derek Schiller, Executive Vice President, Business, adopted a trading plan on September 6, 2024 (with the first trade under the plan scheduled for no sooner than December 8, 2024).

Statements\n(unaudited)\n(1) Basis of Presentation\nDuring November 2022, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty” or “Former parent”) authorized Liberty\nmanagement to pursue a plan to redeem each outstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the\ncorresponding series of common stock of a newly formed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was\ncompleted on July 18, 2023 and was intended to be tax-free to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. In September 2024, the Internal\nRevenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and notified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the\ntransaction. Atlanta Braves Holdings, Inc. (“Atlanta Braves Holdings”) is comprised of the businesses, assets and liabilities previously\nattributed to the Liberty Braves Group (“Braves Group”), which, as of September 30, 2024, included Atlanta Braves Holdings’ wholly-\nowned subsidiary Braves Holdings, LLC (“Braves Holdings”) and corporate cash.\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements represent the combination of the historical financial information\nof the Braves Group until the date of the Split-Off. Although Atlanta Braves Holdings was reported as a combined company until the date\nof the Split-Off, all periods reported herein are referred to as consolidated. These financial statements refer to the consolidation of Braves\nHoldings, cash and intergroup interests in the Braves Group (prior to settlement/extinguishment) as \"Atlanta Braves Holdings,\" \"the\nCompany,\" \"us,\" \"we\" and \"our\" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Split-Off was accounted for at\nhistorical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty Braves common stock. All significant intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, which has been derived from audited\nfinancial statements, and (b) the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X\nas promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required\nby GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)\nconsidered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such periods have been included. The results of operations for any interim\nperiod are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Additionally, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for\ncomparability with current period presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in Atlanta Braves Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\ncondensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates. The Company considers (i) fair value measurements of non-financial instruments and (ii) accounting for\nincome taxes to be its most significant estimates.\nDescription of Business\nBraves Holdings indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta Braves,” the “Braves,”\nthe “club,” or the “team”). ANLBC’s ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”), is located in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta, and is\nleased from Cobb County, Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority. Braves Holdings, through affiliated entities and third party\ndevelopment partners, has developed a significant portion of the land around Truist Park for a mixed-use development that features retail,\noffice, hotel and entertainment opportunities (the “Mixed-Use Development”).\nI-10\nTable of Contents\nATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nThe Braves and 29 other Major League baseball clubs are collectively referred to as the Clubs. The Office of the Commissioner of\nBaseball (the “BOC”) is an unincorporated association also doing business as Major League Baseball (“MLB”) and has as its members the\nClubs. The Clubs are bound by the terms and provisions of the Major League Constitution and all rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of a Club, which among\nother things, require each Club to comply with limitations on the amount of debt a Club can incur, revenue sharing arrangements with the\nother Clubs, commercial arrangements with regard to the national broadcasting of its games and other programming and commercial\narrangements relating to the use of its intellectual property.\nSplit-Off of Atlanta Braves Holdings from Liberty\nPrior to the Split-Off, a portion of Liberty’s general and administrative expenses, including legal, tax, accounting, treasury,\ninformation technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support was allocated to the Braves Group each reporting period based on an\nestimate of time spent. The Braves Group paid $4.5 million during 2023 prior to the Split-Off for such expenses.\nPrior to the Split-Off, the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty SiriusXM Group held\nintergroup interests in the Braves Group. The intergroup interests represented quasi-equity interests which were not represented by\noutstanding shares of common stock; rather, the Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed interests in the Braves\nGroup, which were generally stated in terms of a number of shares of Liberty Braves common stock. As of December 31, 2022, 6,792,903\nnotional shares represented an 11.0% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Formula One Group and 1,811,066 notional\nshares represented a 2.9% intergroup interest in the Braves Group held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Historically, Liberty assumed that\nthe notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C\nLiberty Braves common stock and that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the\nBraves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock. Therefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and\nSeries A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interests held by the Formula One\nGroup and the Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the condensed consolidated statements of operations. During the second\nquarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock\nwould be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly,\neffective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of Series C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the\nmark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty SiriusXM Group.\nThe intergroup interests in the Braves Group remaining immediately prior to the Split-Off were settled and extinguished in\nconnection with the Split-Off through the attribution, to the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common\nstock on a one-for-one basis equal to the number of notional shares representing the intergroup interest.\nFollowing the Split-Off and subsequent Liberty Media Exchange (as defined below), Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings operate\nas separate, publicly traded companies and neither has any continuing stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. Liberty owned\n1,811,066 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock following the Split-Off. In November 2023, Liberty exchanged\n1,811,066 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock with a third party in satisfaction of certain of Liberty’s debt\nobligations and an affiliate of such third party then sold the shares in a secondary public offering (the “Liberty Media Exchange”). Atlanta\nBraves Holdings did not receive any of the proceeds from the Liberty Media Exchange.\nI-11\nTable of Contents\nATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nIn connection with the Split-Off, Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings entered into certain agreements in order to govern certain of\nthe ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Split-Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements\nincluded a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, aircraft time sharing agreements, a facilities sharing agreement, a tax sharing\nagreement and a registration rights agreement. The facilities sharing agreement and aircraft time sharing agreements were terminated as\npart of the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined below).\nThe reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal\nrestructuring) required to effect the Split-Off, certain conditions to the Split-Off and provisions governing the relationship between Atlanta\nBraves Holdings and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Split-Off. The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and\nindemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Atlanta Braves Holdings and other agreements related to tax matters.\nPursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provides Atlanta Braves Holdings with general and administrative services including legal, tax,\naccounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. Atlanta Braves Holdings will reimburse Liberty\nfor direct, out-of-pocket expenses and will pay a services fee to Liberty under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment quarterly,\nas necessary. Additionally, pursuant to the services agreement with Liberty and prior to the Corporate Governance Transition (as defined\nbelow), components of Liberty Chief Executive Officer’s compensation were either paid directly to him or reimbursed to Liberty, in each\ncase, based on allocations set forth in the services agreement. The allocation percentage was 7% for Atlanta Braves Holdings during the\nperiod from July 18, 2023 to December 31, 2023 and was 8% during the period from January 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024, when the\nCorporate Governance Transition (as defined below) occurred.\nPursuant to the registration rights agreement with Liberty, Atlanta Braves Holdings registered the shares of Atlanta Braves\nHoldings’ Series C common stock that were issued to Liberty in settlement and extinguishment of the intergroup interest in the Braves\nGroup attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group and then exchanged by Liberty with a third party in satisfaction of certain debt obligations.\nUnder these various agreements, amounts reimbursable to Liberty aggregated $1.6 million and $4.1 million for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 after the Split-Off.\nRelated Party Transactions and Change in Corporate Governance\nOn August 21, 2024, Terence F. McGuirk (“McGuirk”), Chairman and CEO of Braves Holdings, LLC, entered into certain\nshareholder arrangements with Dr. John Malone (“Malone”), pursuant to which Malone has granted McGuirk a proxy (the “Malone Voting\nAgreement”) to vote 887,079 shares of the Company’s Series B Common Stock owned by Malone, representing 44% of the Company’s\noutstanding voting power, on director elections, the approval or authorization of executive compensation and other routine matters. Malone\nhas also granted McGuirk a right of first refusal with respect to future transfers of the Company shares beneficially owned by Malone as\nwell as certain appreciation rights with respect to the value of Malone’s shares of Series B Common Stock.\nThe execution of the Malone Voting Agreement constituted a “Change in Control” of the Company as defined in Gregory B.\nMaffei’s Executive Employment Agreement, dated effective as of December 13, 2019, by and between Mr. Maffei and Liberty. As a result,\non August 21, 2024, Mr. Maffei notified the Company of his resignation as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and\na director of the Company effective August 31, 2024. Mr. Maffei’s separation from employment with the Company was for “Good Reason”\nwithin the meaning of his Executive Employment Agreement. Additionally, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty have begun transitioning\nvarious general and administrative services currently provided by Liberty to the management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal,\ntax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support.

Braves Holdings also established a special purpose Delaware statutory trust, the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”), and\ntransferred, among other things, to the Club Trust its rights to receive distributions of revenue from the National Broadcasting Contracts,\nwhich secure borrowings under the LWCF. Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow\nfrom certain lenders, with Bank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of\nsuch borrowings to provide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs. Major League Baseball Trust has granted Wells Fargo Bank,\nNational Association, the collateral agent in respect of the LWCF, a first priority lien to secure the borrowings under the LWCF. The\nmaximum amount available to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $125.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The commitment termination\ndate of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such revolving credit\nfacility, is July 10, 2026.\nUnder the LWCF, the Club Trust can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate loan.

The commitment termination date, which is the repayment\ndate for all amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility of the MLBFF, is July 10, 2026.\nUnder a credit agreement, Braves Facility Fund can request a revolving credit advance in the form of a Eurodollar or Base Rate\nloan. Each loan bears interest on the unpaid principal amount from the date made through maturity at a rate determined by a Eurodollar or\nBase Rate, plus an applicable margin.

The\nCompany estimates the expected term of the options based on historical exercise and forfeiture data. The volatility used in the calculation\nfor Awards is based on the historical volatility of Atlanta Braves Holdings common stock (and previously, Liberty Braves common stock).\nThe Company uses a zero dividend rate and the risk-free rate for Treasury Bonds with a term similar to that of the subject options.\nOutstanding Awards\nThe following table presents the number and weighted average exercise price (“WAEP”) of options to purchase Atlanta Braves\nHoldings common stock granted to certain officers, employees and directors, as well as the weighted average remaining life and aggregate\nintrinsic value of the options.\nSeries C\nWeighted Aggregate\naverage intrinsic\nAtlanta Braves Holdings remaining value\noptions (000's) WAEP life (in millions)\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024 3,502 $ 28.36\nGranted — $ —\nExercised (322) $ 26.34\nForfeited/Cancelled — $ —\nOutstanding at September 30, 2024 3,180 $ 28.56 3.6years $ 36\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 2,697 $ 26.97 3.1years $ 35\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding Series A or Series B options to purchase shares of Series A or Series B\nAtlanta Braves Holdings common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Atlanta Braves Holdings Awards was\napproximately $11.1 million.

The Agreed Order provides other protections to ANLBC, MLB and the other covered Clubs to give some\nassurance that the Debtors will pay all required fees under the various club broadcasting agreements, including the Braves Broadcast\nAgreement, until the earlier to occur of (i) a plan of reorganization is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the Debtors exit bankruptcy\nand (ii) the final payment for the 2024 MLB season is paid.\nThe Debtors filed their Disclosure Statement (“Disclosure Statement”) and Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Joint Plan of\nReorganization”) on April 17, 2024. The Bankruptcy Court approved the Disclosure Statement and originally scheduled a hearing to\nconsider confirmation of the Joint Plan of Reorganization for June 18, 2024 (“Confirmation Hearing”). The Confirmation Hearing was\noriginally adjourned to July 29-30, 2024, but on July 24, 2024, the Confirmation Hearing was further adjourned indefinitely. On\nSeptember 3, 2024, the Debtors announced their intention to further amend the Disclosure Statement and Joint Plan of Reorganization in\nhopes of setting the Confirmation Hearing for some time in November. On October 2, 2024, the Debtors filed their First Amended Joint\nChapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (“Amended Plan”) as well as their Disclosure Statement Supplement for the Debtors’ First Amended\nJoint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization (“Disclosure Statement Supplement”). The Debtors filed a further revised version of the Amended\nPlan (“Revised Amended Plan”) on October 9, 2024. On October 9, 2024, the Court approved the Disclosure Statement Supplement and\nscheduled the Confirmation Hearing to consider the Revised Amended Plan for November 14-15, 2024. Such dates are subject to further\nchange.\nThe Debtors have indicated that their preference and intention is to proceed with a reorganization, but the Revised Amended Plan\nincludes a feature that would allow the Debtors to pivot from a reorganization to a liquidation. The treatment of the Braves Broadcast\nAgreement is likely to be very different if the Debtors elect to pivot to a liquidation scenario under the Revised Amended Plan. If the\nDebtors proceed with a reorganization, the Debtors have indicated they intend to seek assumption of the obligations under the Braves\nBroadcast Agreement. If the Revised Amended Plan is confirmed and the Bankruptcy Court allows the Debtors to assume the Braves\nBroadcast Agreement, both ANLBC and Sportsouth Network II, LLC will continue to be responsible for their respective obligations under\nthe Braves Broadcast Agreement. Alternatively, in the event the Debtors pivot to a liquidation, the Revised Amended Plan provides that the\nDebtors will seek to reject the Braves Broadcast Agreement thereby relieving the Debtors of any further performance obligations. The\nRevised Amended Plan currently provides that the Debtors have until December 16, 2024 to elect to pivot to a liquidation. Such date is\nsubject to further change, including pursuant to a further amendment to the Revised Amended Plan or a court order.\nIn the event Diamond Sports Group is unsuccessful in its efforts to confirm the Revised Amended Plan or other plan of\nreorganization, it is possible that the respective bankruptcy cases of the Debtors could be converted to cases under Chapter 7 of the\nbankruptcy code. In such event, a trustee will be appointed to liquidate the remaining assets of the Debtors and ANLBC may be required to\nrepay up to $34.2 million, the amount remitted to ANLBC during the 90-day preference\nI-22\nTable of Contents\nATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nperiod preceding the filing. In addition, if the broadcasting agreement is rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding, ANLBC will not receive\nany revenue from Sportsouth Network II, LLC during the remaining contract term and ANLBC would be required to write-down accounts\nreceivable and contract assets of approximately $35.6 million recorded in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. In addition, a Chapter 7 trustee may reject the Braves Broadcast Agreement which would relieve the Debtors’\nbankruptcy estate from its obligations under the agreement.\nTo date and throughout the Chapter 11 Proceeding, ANLBC has received all scheduled payments in accordance with the Braves\nBroadcast Agreement.\nLitigation\nBraves Holdings, along with the BOC and other MLB affiliates, has been named in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal\ncourse of business. Although it is reasonably possible the Company may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters, an estimate of any\nloss or range of loss cannot be made. In the opinion of management, it is expected that amounts, if any, which may be required to satisfy\nsuch contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(8) Segment Information\nThe Company, through its ownership of Braves Holdings, is primarily engaged in the entertainment and real estate industries. The\nCompany identifies its reportable segments as those operating segments that represent 10% or more of its consolidated annual revenue,\nannual Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below) or total assets.\nThe Company evaluates performance and makes decisions about allocating resources to its operating segments based on financial\nmeasures such as revenue and Adjusted OIBDA (as defined below). In addition, the Company reviews nonfinancial measures such as\nattendance, viewership and social media.\nThe Company has identified the following as its reportable segments:\n● Baseball – operations relating to Braves baseball and Truist Park and includes ticket sales, concessions, advertising\nsponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, broadcasting rights, retail and licensing.\n● Mixed-Use Development – includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery\nAtlanta.\nThe Company’s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services. They are managed\nseparately because each segment requires different technologies, differing revenue sources and marketing strategies.\nI-23\nTable of Contents\nATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nPerformance Measures\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by segment and by source:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nBaseball:\nBaseball event $ 172,800 160,794 345,318 324,280\nBroadcasting 70,992 69,337 144,043 138,786\nRetail and licensing 16,512 20,904 41,789 45,026\nOther 12,958 5,231 30,083 20,670\nTotal Baseball 273,262 256,266 561,233 528,762\nMixed-Use Development 17,412 15,558 49,397 44,157\nTotal revenue $ 290,674 271,824 610,630 572,919\nWhen consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring services to the customer under the terms of a contract,\ndeferred revenue is recorded. The primary source of the Company’s deferred revenue relates to suite and season ticket arrangements, as\nwell as certain sponsorship arrangements. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when, or as, control of the products or services are\ntransferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met. The Company had long-term deferred revenue of $17.9\nmillion and $16.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which were included in other noncurrent\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecognized $99.5 million and $88.2 million, respectively, of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the\nrespective year.\nSignificant portions of the transaction prices for Braves Holdings are related to undelivered performance obligations that are under\ncontractual arrangements that extend beyond one year. The Company anticipates recognizing revenue from the delivery of such\nperformance obligations of approximately $25.8 million for the remainder of 2024, $340.9 million in 2025, $311.9 million in 2026, $521.9\nmillion in 2027 through 2031, and $134.1 million thereafter, primarily recognized through 2041. We have not included any amounts in the\nundelivered performance obligations amounts for those performance obligations that relate to a contract with an original expected duration\nof one year or less.\nFor segment reporting purposes, the Company defines Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses, and selling, general\nand administrative expenses excluding all stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring,\nacquisition and impairment charges. The Company believes this measure is an important indicator of the operational strength and\nperformance of its businesses, by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business’ performance or indicative of\nongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and\nbenchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes depreciation and\namortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition and impairment charges that\nare included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to GAAP. Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition\nto, but not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities and other\nmeasures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nI-24\nTable of Contents\nATLANTA BRAVES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(unaudited)\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nBaseball $ 24,397 36,884 20,072 38,232\nMixed-Use Development 12,173 10,661 33,615 29,980\nCorporate and Other (5,125) (7,234) (10,246) (17,418)\nTotal $ 31,445 40,311 43,441 50,794\nOther Information\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTotal Investments Capital Total Investments Capital\nassets in affiliates expenditures assets in affiliates expenditures\namounts in thousands\nBaseball $ 908,484 100,207 17,266 882,442 84,326 12,152\nMixed-Use Development 604,774 13,722 56,656 571,586 14,887 56,884\nCorporate and other 46,099 — — 51,256 — —\nElimination (1) (2,110) — — (954) — —\nTotal $ 1,557,247 113,929 73,922 1,504,330 99,213 69,036\n(1) This amount relates to income taxes payable that partially offsets income taxes receivable in the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) before income\ntaxes:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nAdjusted OIBDA $ 31,445 40,311 43,441 50,794\nStock-based compensation (6,365) (3,309) (13,789) (9,653)\nDepreciation and amortization (18,678) (21,286) (50,669) (55,215)\nOperating income (loss) 6,402 15,716 (21,017) (14,074)\nInterest expense (9,561) (9,657) (28,717) (28,017)\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates, net 13,702 12,725 26,951 23,384\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net — (20,392) — (83,178)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments,\nnet (2,476) 2,593 1,429 5,672\nOther, net 1,838 1,224 5,824 5,381\nEarnings (loss) before income taxes $ 9,905 2,209 (15,530) (90,832)\nI-25\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.

This\ndiscussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nExplanatory Note\nDuring November 2022, the board of directors of Liberty authorized Liberty management to pursue a plan to redeem each\noutstanding share of its Liberty Braves common stock in exchange for one share of the corresponding series of common stock of a newly\nformed entity, Atlanta Braves Holdings (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was completed on July 18, 2023 and was intended to be tax-free to\nholders of Liberty Braves common stock. In September 2024, the Internal Revenue Service completed its review of the Split-Off and\nnotified Liberty that it agreed with the non-taxable characterization of the transaction. Atlanta Braves Holdings is comprised of the\nbusinesses, assets and liabilities previously attributed to the Liberty Braves Group (“Braves Group”), which, as of September 30, 2024,\nincluded Atlanta Braves Holdings’ wholly-owned subsidiary Braves Holdings and corporate cash. Although Atlanta Braves Holdings was\nreported as a combined company until the date of the Split-Off, all periods reported herein are referred to as consolidated.\nThe intergroup interests in the Braves Group held by the Liberty Formula One Group (the “Formula One Group”) and the Liberty\nSiriusXM Group immediately prior to the Split-Off were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off through the attribution,\nto the respective tracking stock group, of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock on a one-for-one basis equal to the number of\nnotional shares representing the intergroup interest.\nOn August 21, 2024, Terence F. McGuirk (“McGuirk”), Chairman and CEO of Braves Holdings, LLC, entered into certain\nshareholder arrangements with Dr. John Malone (“Malone”), pursuant to which Malone has granted McGuirk a proxy (the “Malone Voting\nAgreement”) to vote 887,079 shares of the Company’s Series B Common Stock owned by Malone, representing 44% of the Company’s\noutstanding voting power, on director elections, the approval or authorization of executive compensation and other routine matters. Malone\nhas also granted McGuirk a right of first refusal with respect\nI-27\nTable of Contents\nto future transfers of the Company shares beneficially owned by Malone as well as certain appreciation rights with respect to the value\nof Malone’s shares of Series B Common Stock.\nThe execution of the Malone Voting Agreement constituted a “Change in Control” of the Company as defined in Gregory B.\nMaffei’s Executive Employment Agreement, dated effective as of December 13, 2019, by and between Mr. Maffei and Liberty. As a result,\non August 21, 2024, Mr. Maffei notified the Company of his resignation as President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and\na director of the Company effective August 31, 2024. Mr. Maffei’s separation from employment with the Company was for “Good Reason”\nwithin the meaning of his Executive Employment Agreement. Additionally, Atlanta Braves Holdings and Liberty have begun transitioning\nvarious general and administrative services currently provided by Liberty to the management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal,\ntax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the then-current\nofficers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and members of\nthe Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024. (the “Corporate Governance Transition”).\nOverview\nThe Company manages its business based on the following reportable segments: baseball and mixed-use development.\nThe baseball segment includes operations relating to the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (“ANLBC,” the “Atlanta\nBraves,” the “Braves,” the “club,” or the “team”) and the Braves’ ballpark (“Truist Park” or the “Stadium”) and includes revenue generated\nfrom ticket sales, concessions, local broadcasting rights, advertising sponsorships, suites and premium seat fees, retail and licensing\nrevenue, shared MLB revenue streams, including national broadcasting rights and licensing, and other sources. Ticket sales, concessions,\nbroadcasting rights and advertising sponsorship sales are the baseball segment’s primary revenue drivers.\nThe Braves have a long-term local television broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC. Diamond Sports Group,\nthe parent company of Sportsouth Network II, LLC, is in financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 protection. Refer to note 7 in the\naccompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for more\ninformation.\nThe mixed-use development segment includes retail, office, hotel and entertainment operations primarily within The Battery\nAtlanta (the “Mixed-Use Development”). The Mixed-Use Development derives revenue primarily from office and retail rental income\n(including overage rent and tenant reimbursements) and, to a lesser extent, parking and advertising sponsorships throughout the year.\nI-28\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations –September 30, 2024 and 2023\nGeneral.

Broadcasting revenue increased $1.7 million and $5.3 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of\nregular season games, as well as contractual rate increases. Retail and licensing revenue decreased $4.4 million and $3.2 million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to\na reduction in local revenue due to the decrease in regular season home game attendance and demand for City Connect and other apparel,\npartially offset by higher league-wide revenue. Other revenue, a component of baseball revenue, increased $7.7 million and $9.4 million\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The\nincrease for the three and nine month periods was primarily due to additional concerts at the Stadium. Additionally, the increase to the nine\nmonth period was due to spring training related revenue (ticket sales, concession revenue and other gameday related revenue) driven by\nincreased attendance at spring training home games.\nMixed-Use Development revenue. Mixed-Use Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily\nincludes rental income and to a lesser extent, parking revenue and sponsorships. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nMixed-Use Development revenue increased $1.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the\nprior year, primarily due to $0.9 million and $2.5 million increases in parking revenue, respectively, and $0.7 million and $2.3 million\nincreases in rental income, respectively. Increases in rental income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily\ndriven by increases in tenant recoveries.\nBaseball operating costs. Baseball operating costs primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, baseball operating expenses increased $27.8 million and $45.8 million, respectively,\nas compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to $16.8 million and $26.3 million increases in major league\nplayer salaries, respectively, $6.9 million and $11.4 million increases in MLB’s revenue sharing plan, as well as other shared expenses,\nrespectively, $2.5 million and $2.4 million increases in concert related expenses, respectively, and $2.1 million and $6.1 million increases\nin minor league team and player expenses, respectively, partially offset by $1.7 million and $4.6 million decreases in variable concession\nand retail operating expenses due to reduced attendance at regular season home games during 2024.\nMixed-Use Development costs. Mixed-Use Development costs primarily include costs associated with maintaining and operating\nthe mixed-use facilities. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Mixed-Use Development costs increased $0.3\nmillion and $0.7 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to general repair expenses and other\nvarious operating increases.\nSelling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expense includes\ncosts of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $0.3 million and\n$1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior\nyear, primarily due to reduced transaction costs related to the Split-Off, partly offset by increased personnel, insurance, information\ntechnology and professional fees.\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation increased $3.1 million and $4.1 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, mainly due to accelerated vesting for\nvarious awards in connection with the Corporate Governance Transition.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $2.6 million and $4.5 million during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to various assets\nbecoming fully depreciated.\nOperating income (loss). Operating income (loss) declined $9.3 million and $6.9 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to the above explanations.\nAdjusted OIBDA. To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we also disclose Adjusted\nOIBDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted OIBDA as operating income\nI-30\nTable of Contents\n(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements, restructuring, acquisition\nand impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with\nother measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an\nimportant indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a\nreflection of each business’ performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating\nresults, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted\nOIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income (loss), net earnings (loss), cash flow provided by\n(used in) operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). The following table provides a reconciliation of Operating income (loss) to Adjusted OIBDA:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nOperating income (loss) $ 6,402 15,716 (21,017) (14,074)\nStock-based compensation 6,365 3,309 13,789 9,653\nDepreciation and amortization 18,678 21,286 50,669 55,215\nAdjusted OIBDA $ 31,445 40,311 43,441 50,794\nAdjusted OIBDA is summarized as follows:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nBaseball $ 24,397 36,884 20,072 38,232\nMixed-Use Development 12,173 10,661 33,615 29,980\nCorporate and Other (5,125) (7,234) (10,246) (17,418)\nTotal $ 31,445 40,311 43,441 50,794\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA decreased $8.9 million and $7.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.\nBaseball Adjusted OIBDA was decreased $12.5 million and $18.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to the fluctuations in baseball revenue and\noperating costs, as described above.\nMixed-Use Development Adjusted OIBDA increased $1.5 million and $3.6 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to the fluctuations in Mixed-\nUse Development revenue and costs, as described above.\nCorporate and Other Adjusted OIBDA loss decreased $2.1 million and $7.2 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to decreased costs related to the\nSplit-Off.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was relatively flat and increased $0.7 million during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, primarily due to increased interest rates on\nthe Company’s variable rate debt.\nI-31\nTable of Contents\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates. The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\namounts in thousands\nMLB Advanced Media, L.P. $ 10,592 9,797 19,283 19,131\nBaseball Endowment, L.P. 1,195 739 4,364 1,450\nOther 1,915 2,189 3,304 2,803\nTotal $ 13,702 12,725 26,951 23,384\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net. As the notional shares underlying the intergroup interests\nwere not represented by outstanding shares of common stock, such shares had not been officially designated Series A, B or C Liberty\nBraves common stock. However, Liberty historically assumed that the notional shares (if and when issued) related to the Formula One\nGroup interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series C Liberty Braves common stock and the notional shares (if and when\nissued) related to the Liberty SiriusXM Group interest in the Braves Group would be comprised of Series A Liberty Braves common stock.\nTherefore, the market prices of Series C Liberty Braves and Series A Liberty Braves common stock were used for the mark-to-market\nadjustment for the intergroup interests held by Formula One Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, through the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. During the second quarter of 2023, Liberty determined that, in connection with the Split-Off, shares\nof Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock would be used to settle and extinguish the intergroup interest in the Braves Group\nattributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Accordingly, effective as of June 30, 2023 and through the Split-Off date, the market price of\nSeries C Liberty Braves common stock was used for the mark-to-market adjustment for the intergroup interest held by the Liberty\nSiriusXM Group. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on intergroup interests, net were driven by changes in the market prices of Liberty\nBraves common stock. As disclosed above, the intergroup interests were settled and extinguished in connection with the Split-Off.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments, net. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial\ninstruments, net are comprised of changes in the fair value of the Company’s interest rate swaps driven by changes in interest rates.\nOther, net. Other, net income increased $0.6 million and $0.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year, due to increases in dividend and interest income, partly offset by\ndecreased gains on dispositions for the nine month period.\nIncome taxes. The Company’s tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of\nour annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update\nour estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.\nIn 2024, our effective tax rate will be affected by state income taxes and the adverse effect of certain non-deductible expenses for\nwhich we may not realize a tax benefit.\nIn 2023, our effective tax rate was significantly affected by the unfavorable impact of intergroup interest losses that were not\ndeductible for tax purposes and the effect of state income taxes.\nNet earnings (loss). The Company had net earnings of $10.0 million and net losses of $6.0 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of $12.1 million and $92.9 million during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The change in net earnings (loss) was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses\nand other gains and losses.\nI-32\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $100.9 million of cash and cash equivalents. Substantially all of our cash and cash\nequivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money\nmarket funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.\nBraves Holdings is in compliance with all financial debt covenants as of September 30, 2024.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s primary uses of cash were capital expenditures and debt\nservice, funded primarily by cash from operations and new borrowings on construction loans.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s primary uses of cash were capital expenditures and debt\nservice, funded primarily by cash from operations and new borrowings on construction loans.\nThe Company’s uses of cash are expected to be payments to certain players, coaches and executives pursuant to long-term\nemployment agreements, capital expenditures, investments in real estate ventures and debt service payments. The Company expects to fund\nits projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and through borrowings under construction loans and revolvers.\nWe believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\nThe Braves have a long-term local television broadcasting agreement with Sportsouth Network II, LLC. Diamond Sports Group,\nLLC, the parent company of Sportsouth Network II, LLC, is in financial distress and has filed for Chapter 11 protection. While the pending\nbankruptcy proceeding of Diamond Sports Group, LLC has not previously had a material unfavorable impact on the Company’s revenue\nand the Company has received scheduled payments to date, we cannot currently predict whether such bankruptcy proceeding is reasonably\nlikely to have a material unfavorable impact on our revenue and liquidity in the future.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by Braves Holdings’ operating activities\n(to the extent such cash exceeds Braves Holdings’ working capital needs and is not otherwise restricted), net proceeds from asset sales, debt\nborrowings under the LWCF, the MLBFF and the TeamCo Revolver (each as defined below) and dividend and interest receipts.\nLeague Wide Credit Facility\nIn December 2013, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into MLB’s League Wide Credit Facility\n(the “LWCF”). Pursuant to the terms of a revolving credit agreement, Major League Baseball Trust may borrow from certain lenders, with\nBank of America, N.A. acting as the administrative agent. Major League Baseball Trust then uses the proceeds of such borrowings to\nprovide loans to the club trusts of the participating Clubs, including the Braves Club Trust (the “Club Trust”). The maximum amount\navailable to the Club Trust under the LWCF was $125.0 million as of September 30, 2024, which remains undrawn. The commitment\ntermination date of the revolving credit facility under the LWCF, which is the repayment date for all amounts borrowed under such\nrevolving credit facility, is July 10, 2026.\nMLB Facility Fund Revolver\nIn December 2017, a subsidiary of Braves Holdings executed various agreements to enter into the MLB Facility Fund (the\n“MLBFF”). Pursuant to the terms of an indenture, a credit agreement and certain note purchase agreements, Major League Baseball\nFacility Fund, LLC may borrow from certain lenders. Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC then uses the proceeds of such\nborrowings to provide loans to each of the participating Clubs. Amounts advanced pursuant to the MLBFF are available to fund ballpark\nand other baseball-related real property improvements, renovations and/or new construction. In May 2021, Braves Facility Fund LLC\nestablished a revolving credit commitment with Major League Baseball Facility Fund, LLC (the “MLB facility fund — revolver”). The\ncommitment termination date, which is the\nI-33\nTable of Contents\nrepayment date for all amounts borrowed under the MLB facility fund — revolver, is July 10, 2026. The maximum amount available to\nBraves Facility Fund LLC under the MLB facility fund — revolver was $39.7 million and was fully drawn as of September 30, 2024.\nTeamCo Revolver\nA subsidiary of Braves Holdings is party to a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “TeamCo Revolver”), which provides revolving\ncommitments of $150 million and matures in August 2029. The availability under the TeamCo Revolver as of September 30, 2024 was\n$120.0 million, net of $30 million drawn as of September 30, 2024.\nSee note 5 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of all indebtedness obligations.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business due to our ongoing investing and financial activities and the\nconduct of operations. Market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in stock prices and interest rates. The risk of loss\ncan be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values, cash flows and future earnings. We have established policies,\nprocedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure\nto such risks.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities, which include fixed and floating rate\ndebt instruments and borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and\nshort-term debt are expected to vary as a result of future requirements, market conditions and other factors. We manage our exposure to\ninterest rates by maintaining what we believe is an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We believe this best protects us from\ninterest rate risk. We have achieved this mix by (i) issuing fixed rate debt that we believe has a low stated interest rate and significant term\nto maturity, (ii) issuing variable rate debt with appropriate maturities and interest rates and (iii) entering into interest rate swap\narrangements when we deem appropriate.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $161.9 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate debt with a weighted average\ninterest rate of 6.6% and $481.2 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nIn accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), the\nCompany carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its chief executive officer\nand chief financial officer (the \"Executives\"), and under the oversight of its board of directors, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Executives concluded that the\nCompany's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information\nrequired to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.\nEffective September 1, 2024, as described in footnote 1 of this quarterly report, Liberty began transitioning certain general and\nadministrative services previously provided by Liberty to the new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings, including legal,\ntax, accounting, treasury, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit and investor relations support. As part of that transition, the\nthen-current officers of the Company (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, effective August 31, 2024, and\ncertain members of the Braves operating team assumed these roles effective September 1, 2024. As a result of the transition, internal\ncontrols over financial reporting are materially changing as executive oversight transitions to the new Atlanta Braves Holdings officers and\nthe new members of management of Atlanta Braves Holdings begin to perform certain accounting, financial reporting, treasury, tax and\nentity level internal controls over financial reporting previously performed by members of Liberty management. We expect the\nI-34\nTable of Contents\nimpacted processes to remain generally consistent through the transition to the new control operators, and other than the transition of these\ninternal controls over financial reporting to new process and control operators, the existing control environment is not materially changing.\nThe transition of the internal controls over financial reporting has begun and should generally be completed with the 10-K filing for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024.\nI-35\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nRefer to note 7 in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nExcept as discussed below, there have been no material changes in the Company’s risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item\n1A. Risk Factors of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs we begin transitioning away from services previously provided by Liberty, we may fail to replicate or replace certain functions,\nsystems and infrastructure in a timely fashion, or at all, and may lose benefits from Liberty’s global contracts.\nHistorically, we have received services from Liberty, including through shared services contracts with various third-party service\nproviders. Under the Services Agreement, Liberty has agreed to continue to provide us with certain services and support that were\nhistorically provided to us by or through Liberty prior to the Split-Off. The Services Agreement does not continue indefinitely and services\nprovided under the Services Agreement generally terminate at various times specified in the agreement and the schedules thereto. We have\nbegun transitioning away from certain services previously provided under the Services Agreement. For instance, Liberty previously\nprovided some of its executive officers to serve as executive officers of the Company. As previously disclosed, as part of the transition of\nvarious general and administrative services provided by Liberty under the Services Agreement, on August 31, 2024, all of the officers of\nthe Company previously provided by Liberty (with limited exceptions) stepped down from their officer positions, and members of the\nBraves operating team assumed these roles effective as of September 1, 2024. These transitions included appointing a new chief executive\nofficer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer, chief culture officer and executive vice presidents of the Company.\nWe are working to replicate or replace the services, and associated systems and data, and information security and cybersecurity\nprocedures and systems, that we will continue to need in the operation of our business that have been provided by or through Liberty,\nincluding those we receive through shared service contracts Liberty has with various third-party providers or through the Services\nAgreement for applicable transitional periods. As a result, when Liberty ceases to provide these services to us, either as a result of the\ntermination of the Services Agreement or individual services thereunder, our costs of performing or procuring these services or comparable\nreplacement services could increase. In addition, we have historically received certain informal support from Liberty, including\ncommunications, technical support, market intelligence and market data, which may not be addressed in our transition plans. The level of\nthis informal support may be eliminated following the termination of the Services Agreement.\nFurthermore, in connection with our efforts to replicate or replace these services, certain third-party systems we are using may\nhave imbedded risks such as cybersecurity susceptibility that we may not be able to resolve effectively or efficiently. As a result, we may\nneed to purchase comparable replacement services on less favorable commercial and legal terms, and the cessation of such services could\nresult in service interruptions and divert management attention from other aspects of our operations, including ongoing efforts to\nimplement technological developments and innovations.\nWe are also making infrastructure investments and hiring additional employees to operate without the same access to Liberty’s\nexisting operational and administrative infrastructure. We have established or expanded our own tax, treasury, internal audit, accounting,\ninvestor relations, cybersecurity, corporate governance and listed company compliance and other corporate functions. Due to the scope and\ncomplexity of the underlying projects relative to these efforts, we have been incurring and expect to continue to incur one-time costs to\nreplicate, or outsource from other providers, these corporate functions to replace the corporate services that Liberty historically provided us\nprior to the Split-Off and under the Services Agreement. The amount of total costs could be materially higher than our estimate, and the\ntiming of the incurrence of these costs may be subject to change.\nII-1\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThere were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, zero shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series A common stock, zero shares\nof Atlanta Braves Holdings Series B common stock and 269 shares of Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C common stock were surrendered\nby our officers and employees to pay withholding taxes and other deductions in connection with the vesting or exercise of restricted stock.\nItem 5. Other Information\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, the following Section 16 officers adopted, modified, or terminated a “Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act):\n● Derek Schiller, Executive Vice President, Business, adopted a trading plan on September 6, 2024 (with the first trade under the\nplan scheduled for no sooner than December 8, 2024).
