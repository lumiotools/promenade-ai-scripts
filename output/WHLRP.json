(NYSE:CDRpB)(NYSE:CDRpC) (\"Cedar\") and Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (Nasdaq:WHLR) (\"Wheeler\") jointly announced that, on September 4, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the 2023 Order of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland dismissing a putative class action complaint, entitled _Kim, et al., v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al._ , filed by purported holders of Cedar's preferred stock against Cedar, Wheeler and Cedar's former board of directors. In affirming the trial court's decision, the appellate court (in a published opinion) stated that \"courts are not time machines for disgruntled buyers. We resolve legal claims. And [p]laintiffs do not adequately allege that [d]efendants violated any legal right or duty - they only allege that they regret the terms they bargained for.\"\n\nWheeler acquired all of Cedar's outstanding common stock in August 2022. The complaint contained allegations against Cedar and its former directors for breach of contract related to the terms of the contract governing Cedar's preferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty against Cedar's former directors, and tort claims against Wheeler.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court's decision, which represents a very positive outcome for both Wheeler and Cedar. With this matter behind us, both companies remain well-positioned to execute on their strategic plans,\" said M. Andrew Franklin, chief executive officer of both Cedar and Wheeler.\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/0b857c0c-23d0-4ead-9972-6f1395696181/913159/image.png)\n\n**About Cedar Realty Trust, Inc.**\n\nCedar Realty Trust, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., is a Maryland corporation (taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\")) that focuses on owning and operating income producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers in the Northeast.

availability, terms and deployment of capital; substantial\ndilution of our common stock, par value $0.01 (\"Common Stock\") and steep decline in its market value resulting\nfrom the exercise by the holders of our Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Preferred\nStock\") of their redemption rights and downward adjustment of the conversion price on our outstanding 7.00%\nSubordinated Convertible Notes due 2031 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), each of which has already occurred and is\nanticipated to continue; given the volatility in the trading of our Common Stock, whether we have registered a\nsufficient number of shares of our Common Stock to cover all Series D Preferred Stock redemptions tendered to\nus by the holders thereof; the degree and nature of our competition; changes in governmental regulations,\naccounting rules, tax rates and similar matters; the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants and other\nthird parties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the Company;

damage to the Company’s properties\nfrom catastrophic weather and other natural events, and the physical effects of climate change; the risk that an\nuninsured loss on the Company’s properties or a loss that exceeds the limits of the Company’s insurance policies\ncould subject the Company to lost capital or revenue on those properties; the risk that continued increases in the\ncost of necessary insurance could negatively impact the Company's profitability; the Company’s ability and\nwillingness to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") in light of economic, market,\nlegal, tax and other considerations; the ability of our operating partnership, Wheeler REIT, L.P.

For a description of the risks and\nuncertainties that could impact the Company's future results, performance or transactions, see the reports filed by\nthe Company with the SEC, including its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. There\ncan be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that the Company has\nanticipated. Except for ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by the federal securities\nlaws, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements\nto reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. All of\nthe above factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect the Company’s actual\nresults and may be beyond the Company’s control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible\nfor the Company’s management to predict all such factors or to assess the effects of each factor on the\nCompany’s business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company’s current expectations will be\nrealized.\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 3\nGlossary of Terms\nTerm Definition\nAdjusted FFO We believe the computation of funds from operations (\"FFO\") in accordance with the\n(\"AFFO\") National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' (\"Nareit\") definition includes\ncertain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio\nand affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items\ninclude, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation\nexpense, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs. Therefore, in addition\nto FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), a non-GAAP measure, for REITs,\nwhich we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments\nare appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating\nperformance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental\nmeasure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many\nREITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no\nassurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of\nother REITs.\nAnchor Lease occupying 20,000 square feet or more.\nAnnualized Base Monthly base rent on occupied space as of the end of the current reporting period\nRent (\"ABR\") multiplied by twelve months, excluding the impact of tenant concessions and rent\nabatements.\nEarnings Before A widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes, when\nInterest, Taxes, considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to\nDepreciation and investors and lenders in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant\nAmortization basis for comparison against other companies, including other REITs. While EBITDA\n(\"EBITDA\") should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to the Company’s\ncommon stockholders, net operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or\nother income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company\nbelieves that EBITDA may provide additional information with respect to the Company’s\nperformance or ability to meet its future debt service requirements, capital expenditures\nand working capital requirements. The Company computes EBITDA by excluding\ninterest expense, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and\namortization, and impairment of long-lived assets and notes receivable from income\nfrom continuing operations. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA, which\nexcludes items affecting the comparability of the periods presented, including but not\nlimited to, costs associated with acquisitions and capital related activities.\nFunds from We use FFO, a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating\nOperations (\"FFO\") performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We\ncompute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of\nNareit in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and\nDecember 2018). As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in\naccordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real\nestate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan\norigination costs), plus impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after\nadjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry\nanalysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate\nsupplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or\nlosses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can\nassist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate\nbetween periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as\na supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are\ncertain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary\nmeasure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate\nassets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate\nassets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have\nrisen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a\nvaluable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating\nresults.\nGross Leasable Area The total amount of leasable space in an investment property.\n(\"GLA\")\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 4\nTerm Definition\nGround Lease A lease in which the tenant owns the building but not the land it is built on.\nLeased Rate / The space committed to lessee under a signed lease agreement as a percentage of\n% Leased gross leasable area executed through September 30, 2024.\nLocal Tenant Tenant with presence in one state with 10 or less locations.\nNational / Regional Tenant with presence in multiple states or single state presence with more than 10\nTenant locations.\nOccupancy Rate / The space delivered to a tenant under a signed lease agreement as a percentage of\n% Occupied gross leasable area through September 30, 2024.\nRent Spread:\nNew Rent Spread Weighted average change over the gross value of the new lease, annualized per\nsquare foot, compared to the annualized base rent per square foot of the prior tenant.\nRenewal Rent Weighted average change over the gross value of the renewed lease, annualized per\nSpread square foot, compared to the annualized base rent per square foot of the prior rate.\nSame-Property Properties owned during all periods presented herein.\nSame-Property Net Same-Property net operating income (\"Same-Property NOI\") is a widely-used non-\nOperating Income GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that Same-Property NOI is\n(\"Same-Property a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company\nNOI\") defines Same-Property NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less\nproperty and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate\ntaxes). Because Same-Property NOI excludes general and administrative expenses,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income\ntaxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment\ncharges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year,\nreflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating\ncommercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in\noccupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not\nimmediately apparent from net income. The Company uses Same-Property NOI to\nevaluate its operating performance since Same-Property NOI allows the Company to\nevaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates\nand tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. Properties are\nincluded in Same-Property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both\nperiods being compared. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under\nGAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are\nexcluded from Same-Property NOI.\nThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is consolidated operating\nincome. Same-Property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated\noperating income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.\nFurther, Same-Property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry\ndefinition and, as such, it is not consistently defined or reported on among the\nCompany's peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison among\nREITs.\nSOFR Secured Overnight Financing Rate\nUndeveloped Vacant land without GLA.\nProperty\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 5\nCompany Overview\nHeadquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.

When used in this presentation, the words \"continue,\"\n\"may,\" \"approximately,\" \"potentially,\" or similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. These risks include,\nwithout limitation: the use of and demand for retail space; general and economic business conditions, including\nthose affecting the ability of individuals to spend in retail shopping centers and/or the rate and other terms on\nwhich we are able to lease our properties; the loss or bankruptcy of the Company's tenants; economic and real\nestate conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast where our properties are geographically\nconcentrated; consumer spending and confidence trends; availability, terms and deployment of capital; substantial\ndilution of our common stock, par value $0.01 (\"Common Stock\") and steep decline in its market value resulting\nfrom the exercise by the holders of our Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Preferred\nStock\") of their redemption rights and downward adjustment of the conversion price on our outstanding 7.00%\nSubordinated Convertible Notes due 2031 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), each of which has already occurred and is\nanticipated to continue; given the volatility in the trading of our Common Stock, whether we have registered a\nsufficient number of shares of our Common Stock to cover all Series D Preferred Stock redemptions tendered to\nus by the holders thereof; the degree and nature of our competition; changes in governmental regulations,\naccounting rules, tax rates and similar matters; the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants and other\nthird parties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the Company; the\nability and willingness of the Company’s tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration; the\nCompany’s ability to re-lease its properties on the same or better terms in the event of non-renewal or in the event\nthe Company exercises its right to replace an existing tenant, and obligations the Company may incur in\nconnection with the replacement of an existing tenant; litigation risks generally; the risk that shareholder litigation\nfiled by the Company's former CEO, Daniel Khoshaba, may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification\nand liability, and divert management's attention away from running the Company; financing risks, such as the\nCompany’s inability to obtain new financing or refinancing on favorable terms as the result of market volatility or\ninstability and increases in the Company’s borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 2\nfactors; the impact of the Company’s leverage on operating performance; our ability to successfully execute\nstrategic or necessary asset acquisitions and divestitures; risks related to the market for retail space generally,\nincluding reductions in consumer spending, variability in retailer demand for leased space, adverse impact of e-\ncommerce, ongoing consolidation in the retail sector and changes in economic conditions and consumer\nconfidence; risks endemic to real estate and the real estate industry generally; the adverse effect of any future\npandemic, endemic or outbreak of infectious diseases, and mitigation efforts, including government-imposed\nlockdowns, to control their spread;

competitive risks; risks related to the geographic concentration of the Company’s properties in the\nMid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast; the Company’s ability to regain compliance with the listing standards of the\nNasdaq Capital Market (\"Nasdaq\") and maintain its listing thereon;

damage to the Company’s properties\nfrom catastrophic weather and other natural events, and the physical effects of climate change; the risk that an\nuninsured loss on the Company’s properties or a loss that exceeds the limits of the Company’s insurance policies\ncould subject the Company to lost capital or revenue on those properties; the risk that continued increases in the\ncost of necessary insurance could negatively impact the Company's profitability; the Company’s ability and\nwillingness to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") in light of economic, market,\nlegal, tax and other considerations; the ability of our operating partnership, Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the \"operating\nPartnership\"), and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies to be classified as partnerships or\ndisregarded entities for federal income tax purposes; the impact of e-commerce on our tenants’ business; and the\ninability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax\nor other applicable laws.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this document are based on our current expectations and beliefs\nconcerning future developments and their potential effects on the Company. For a description of the risks and\nuncertainties that could impact the Company's future results, performance or transactions, see the reports filed by\nthe Company with the SEC, including its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K. There\ncan be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those that the Company has\nanticipated. Except for ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by the federal securities\nlaws, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements\nto reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. All of\nthe above factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect the Company’s actual\nresults and may be beyond the Company’s control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible\nfor the Company’s management to predict all such factors or to assess the effects of each factor on the\nCompany’s business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company’s current expectations will be\nrealized.\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 3\nGlossary of Terms\nTerm Definition\nAdjusted FFO We believe the computation of funds from operations (\"FFO\") in accordance with the\n(\"AFFO\") National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' (\"Nareit\") definition includes\ncertain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio\nand affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items\ninclude, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation\nexpense, non-cash amortization on loans and acquisition costs. Therefore, in addition\nto FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), a non-GAAP measure, for REITs,\nwhich we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments\nare appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating\nperformance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental\nmeasure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many\nREITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no\nassurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of\nother REITs.\nAnchor Lease occupying 20,000 square feet or more.\nAnnualized Base Monthly base rent on occupied space as of the end of the current reporting period\nRent (\"ABR\") multiplied by twelve months, excluding the impact of tenant concessions and rent\nabatements.\nEarnings Before A widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes, when\nInterest, Taxes, considered with financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, is useful to\nDepreciation and investors and lenders in understanding financial performance and providing a relevant\nAmortization basis for comparison against other companies, including other REITs. While EBITDA\n(\"EBITDA\") should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to the Company’s\ncommon stockholders, net operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or\nother income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company\nbelieves that EBITDA may provide additional information with respect to the Company’s\nperformance or ability to meet its future debt service requirements, capital expenditures\nand working capital requirements. The Company computes EBITDA by excluding\ninterest expense, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, depreciation and\namortization, and impairment of long-lived assets and notes receivable from income\nfrom continuing operations. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA, which\nexcludes items affecting the comparability of the periods presented, including but not\nlimited to, costs associated with acquisitions and capital related activities.\nFunds from We use FFO, a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating\nOperations (\"FFO\") performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We\ncompute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of\nNareit in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and\nDecember 2018). As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in\naccordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real\nestate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan\norigination costs), plus impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after\nadjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry\nanalysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate\nsupplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or\nlosses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can\nassist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate\nbetween periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses FFO as\na supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are\ncertain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary\nmeasure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate\nassets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate\nassets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have\nrisen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a\nvaluable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating\nresults.\nGross Leasable Area The total amount of leasable space in an investment property.\n(\"GLA\")\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 4\nTerm Definition\nGround Lease A lease in which the tenant owns the building but not the land it is built on.\nLeased Rate / The space committed to lessee under a signed lease agreement as a percentage of\n% Leased gross leasable area executed through September 30, 2024.\nLocal Tenant Tenant with presence in one state with 10 or less locations.\nNational / Regional Tenant with presence in multiple states or single state presence with more than 10\nTenant locations.\nOccupancy Rate / The space delivered to a tenant under a signed lease agreement as a percentage of\n% Occupied gross leasable area through September 30, 2024.\nRent Spread:\nNew Rent Spread Weighted average change over the gross value of the new lease, annualized per\nsquare foot, compared to the annualized base rent per square foot of the prior tenant.\nRenewal Rent Weighted average change over the gross value of the renewed lease, annualized per\nSpread square foot, compared to the annualized base rent per square foot of the prior rate.\nSame-Property Properties owned during all periods presented herein.\nSame-Property Net Same-Property net operating income (\"Same-Property NOI\") is a widely-used non-\nOperating Income GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that Same-Property NOI is\n(\"Same-Property a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company\nNOI\") defines Same-Property NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less\nproperty and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate\ntaxes). Because Same-Property NOI excludes general and administrative expenses,\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income\ntaxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment\ncharges, it provides a performance measure, that when compared year over year,\nreflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating\ncommercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in\noccupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not\nimmediately apparent from net income. The Company uses Same-Property NOI to\nevaluate its operating performance since Same-Property NOI allows the Company to\nevaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates\nand tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. Properties are\nincluded in Same-Property NOI if they are owned and operated for the entirety of both\nperiods being compared. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under\nGAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing costs are\nexcluded from Same-Property NOI.\nThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is consolidated operating\nincome. Same-Property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated\noperating income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity.\nFurther, Same-Property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry\ndefinition and, as such, it is not consistently defined or reported on among the\nCompany's peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison among\nREITs.\nSOFR Secured Overnight Financing Rate\nUndeveloped Vacant land without GLA.\nProperty\nWHLR | Financial & Operating Data 5\nCompany Overview\nHeadquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.

(the \"Trust,\" the \"REIT,\" the \"Company,\" \"WHLR,\" \"we,\" \"our\"\nor \"us\") contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or\nachievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements,\nwhich are based on certain assumptions and describe the Company's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words \"may\", \"will\",\n\"should\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"expects\", \"intends\", \"future\", and words of similar import, or the negative thereof. These statements are not\nguarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. You are cautioned to not place undue reliance on forward-\nlooking statements, which reflect our management’s view only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to\nreflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results.\nFactors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-Q include, but are\nnot limited to:\n• the use of and demand for retail space;\n• general and economic business conditions, including those affecting the ability of individuals to spend in retail shopping centers and/or the rate and other terms on which\nwe are able to lease our properties;\n• the loss or bankruptcy of the Company's tenants;\n• economic and real estate conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast where our properties are geographically concentrated;\n• consumer spending and confidence trends;\n• availability, terms and deployment of capital;\n• substantial dilution of our common stock, par value $0.01 (\"Common Stock\") and steep decline in its market value resulting from the exercise by the holders of our\nSeries D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Preferred Stock\") of their redemption rights and downward adjustment of the conversion price on our\noutstanding 7.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2031 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), each of which has already occurred and is anticipated to continue;\n• given the volatility in the trading of our Common Stock, whether we have registered a sufficient number of shares of our Common Stock to cover all Series D Preferred\nStock redemptions tendered to us by the holders thereof;\n• the degree and nature of our competition;\n• changes in governmental regulations, accounting rules, tax rates and similar matters;\n• the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants and other third parties to satisfy their obligations under their respective contractual arrangements with the\nCompany;\n• the ability and willingness of the Company’s tenants to renew their leases with the Company upon expiration;\n• the Company’s ability to re-lease its properties on the same or better terms in the event of non-renewal or in the event the Company exercises its right to replace an\nexisting tenant, and obligations the Company may incur in connection with the replacement of an existing tenant;\n• litigation risks generally;\n• the risk that shareholder litigation filed by the Company's former CEO, Daniel Khoshaba, may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, and\ndivert management's attention away from running the Company;\n• financing risks, such as the Company’s inability to obtain new financing or refinancing on favorable terms as the result of market volatility or instability and increases in\nthe Company’s borrowing costs as a result of changes in interest rates and other factors;\n• the impact of the Company’s leverage on operating performance;\n• our ability to successfully execute strategic or necessary asset acquisitions and divestitures;\n4\nTable of Contents\n• risks related to the market for retail space generally, including reductions in consumer spending, variability in retailer demand for leased space, adverse impact of e-\ncommerce, ongoing consolidation in the retail sector and changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence;\n• risks endemic to real estate and the real estate industry generally;\n• the adverse effect of any future pandemic, endemic or outbreak of infectious diseases, and mitigation efforts, including government-imposed lockdowns, to control their\nspread;\n• risks to our information systems - or those of our tenants or vendors - from service interruption, misappropriation of data, breaches of security or information technology,\nor other cyber-related attacks;\n• competitive risks;\n• risks related to the geographic concentration of the Company’s properties in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast;\n• the Company’s ability to regain compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market (\"Nasdaq\") and maintain its listing thereon;\n• the effects on the trading market of our Common Stock of the one-for-10 reverse stock split effected on August 17, 2023 (the \"August 2023 Reverse Stock Split\"), the\none-for-24 reverse stock split effected on May 16, 2024 (the \"May 2024 Reverse Stock Split\"), the one-for-five reverse stock split effected on June 27, 2024 (the \"June\n2024 Reverse Stock Split\", the one-for-three reverse stock split effected on September 19, 2024 (the \"September 2024 Reverse Stock Split\" and collectively with the\nMay 2024 Reverse Stock Split and June 2024 Reverse Stock Split, the “2024 Reverse Stock Splits”) and any reverse stock splits the Company may effect in the future;\n• damage to the Company’s properties from catastrophic weather and other natural events, and the physical effects of climate change;\n• the risk that an uninsured loss on the Company’s properties or a loss that exceeds the limits of the Company’s insurance policies could subject the Company to lost\ncapital or revenue on those properties;\n• the risk that continued increases in the cost of necessary insurance could negatively impact the Company's profitability;\n• the Company’s ability and willingness to maintain its qualification as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") in light of economic, market, legal, tax and other\nconsiderations;\n• the ability of our operating partnership, Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\"), and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies to be\nclassified as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes;\n• the impact of e-commerce on our tenants’ business; and\n• the inability to generate sufficient cash flows due to market conditions, competition, uninsured losses, changes in tax or other applicable laws.\nForward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q should be read in light of these factors. Except for ongoing obligations to disclose material information as required by the\nfederal securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date\nhereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. All of the above factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect the Company’s actual\nresults and may be beyond the Company’s control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company’s management to predict all such factors or to\nassess the effects of each factor on the Company’s business. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company’s current expectations will be realized.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCondensed

Business and Organization\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the\n\"Operating Partnership\"), which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. At September 30, 2024, the Company owned 99.69% of the Operating\nPartnership. As of September 30, 2024, the Trust owned and operated seventy-three retail shopping centers and two undeveloped properties in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia,\nPennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Connecticut, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland and West Virginia. These centers and undeveloped\nproperties include the properties acquired through the Cedar Acquisition (defined below). Accordingly, the use of the word \"Company\", \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" refers to the Trust and\nconsolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise requires.\nThe Trust through the Operating Partnership owns Wheeler Interests (\"WI\") and Wheeler Real Estate, LLC (\"WRE\") (WRE and, together with WI, the \"Operating\nCompanies\"). The Operating Companies are taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\") to accommodate serving the non-REIT properties since applicable REIT regulations consider the\nincome derived from these services to be \"bad\" income subject to taxation. The regulations allow for costs incurred by the Company commensurate with the services performed\nfor the non-REIT properties to be allocated to a TRS.\nAcquisition of Cedar Realty Trust\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed a merger transaction (the \"Cedar Acquisition\") with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (\"Cedar\"). As a result of the merger, the\nCompany acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cedar’s common stock, which ceased to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"). Through this\nacquisition, the Company acquired an additional 19 retail shopping centers in the Northeast. Cedar’s outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred\nStock (\"Cedar Series C Preferred Stock\") remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. As a result of the Cedar Acquisition, Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation/Basis of Preparation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and include all of the\ninformation and disclosures required by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") for interim reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the disclosures\nrequired by GAAP for complete financial statement disclosures. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for fair presentation (including normal recurring\naccruals) have been included. All material balances and transactions between the consolidated entities of the Company have been eliminated. All per share amounts, common\nunits and shares outstanding, warrants, and conversion features of the Convertible Notes for all periods presented reflect our August 2023 Reverse Stock Split, May 2024 Reverse\nStock Split, June 2024 Reverse Stock Split and September 2024 Reverse Stock Split, which took effect on August 17, 2023, May 16, 2024, June 27, 2024 and September 19,\n2024, respectively. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the\nreported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods covered by the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"2023 Form 10-K\").\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q include Cedar starting from the date of the Cedar Acquisition. We have\ndetermined that this acquisition is not a variable interest entity, as defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), Accounting\nStandards Codification (\"ASC\"), and we evaluated such entity under the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate\nthe entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting rights and that other equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.\n11\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nSupplemental Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Information\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nNon-Cash Transactions:\nConversion of common units to Common Stock $ — $ 57\nConversion of Series D Preferred Stock to Common Stock — 140\nAccretion of Preferred Stock discounts 65 438\nRedemption of Series D Preferred Stock to Common Stock 6,206 —\nBuildings and improvements included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,389 1,979\nOther Cash Transactions:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 719 $ 798\nCash paid for interest 19,308 18,951\nOther Expense\nOther expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature.

These reclassifications had no effect on net loss.\n3. Real Estate\nA significant portion of the Company’s land, buildings and improvements serve as collateral for its secured term loans.

Investment Securities - Related Party\nIn 2023, the Company subscribed for an investment in the amount of $10.0 million for limited partnership interests in Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., a Delaware\nlimited partnership (\"SAI\"). On June 1, 2024, the Company subscribed for an additional investment in the amount of $0.5 million for limited partnership interests in SAI. The\ninvestment objective of SAI is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investing primarily in publicly-traded undervalued financial institutions or businesses with a strong\nfinancial component, or the securities of any of them, and pursuing an activist shareholder agenda with respect to those institutions.\nStilwell Value LLC (\"Value\") is the general partner of SAI. Joseph Stilwell, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, is the managing member of Value and a\nlimited partner in funds advised by Value. Additionally, E.J. Borrack, a member of the Board of Directors, serves as the General Counsel to Value and its affiliated entities,\nincluding SAI and related funds, and is a limited partner in one of the funds advised by Value. Megan Parisi, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, serves as the\nDirector of Communications to Value and its affiliated entities, including SAI and related funds, is a non-managing member of Value and is a limited partner in one of the funds\nadvised by Value.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company’s subscriptions were approved by the disinterested directors of the Company, and, after the formation of the Related Person Transactions Committee, by\nthat Committee.\nA portion of SAI's underlying investments are in the Company's own equity and debt securities.\nSAI records investment transactions based on trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.\nDividend income, net of withholding taxes, and dividend expense are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income and expense are recognized on an accrual basis.\nDiscounts and premiums to the face amount of debt securities are accreted and amortized using the effective interest rate method over the lives of the respective debt securities.\nA limited partner in SAI may request a withdrawal after the expiration of the first anniversary of the date its investment was accepted into SAI. After the expiration of\nthis lock-up period, withdrawal requests can be made quarterly and are generally paid out on a quarterly basis in accordance with the terms of the SAI limited partnership\nagreement.\nIn consideration for management, administrative and operational services, limited partners of SAI pay a management fee to an affiliate of Value each calendar quarter, in\nadvance, equal to 0.25% (an annualized rate of 1%) of each limited partner’s capital account balance on the first day of such calendar quarter. In addition, as of the last day of\neach specified performance period, an incentive allocation of 20% of the amount by which the \"positive performance change,\" if any, that has been credited to the capital account\nof a limited partner during such period exceeds any positive balance in such limited partner’s \"carryforward account,\" is debited from the limited partner’s capital account and is\nsimultaneously credited to the capital account of Value.\nThe Company’s SAI investment is accounted for under the equity method and measured at net asset value as a practical expedient and has not been classified within the\nfair value hierarchy. All gains and losses, realized and unrealized, and fees are recorded through \"gains (losses) on investment securities, net\" in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Company’s SAI investment was $12.0 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nthe gain on investment securities, net was $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.

As a result of that transaction, the Company recognized a $0.7 million loss, which represents the fair value of the purchase price over the amount of principal\nreduction. The loss is included in \"other expense\" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 28,105 shares of its Common Stock, having an aggregate fair value of\n$0.4 million, to settle conversion requests of the holders of the Convertible Notes comprising an aggregate principal amount of $0.1 million, which resulted in an aggregate net\nloss on conversion of Convertible Notes of $0.4 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes was approximately $2.37 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (approximately 10.53\nshares of Common Stock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted).\nInterest expense on the Convertible Notes consisted of the following (in thousands, except for shares):\nSeries B Preferred Series D Preferred\nFor the Nine Months Ended Stock Stock Convertible Note\nSeptember 30, number of shares (1) number of shares (1) interest at 7% coupon Fair value adjustment Interest expense\n2024 — 109,676 $ 1,624 $ 948 $ 2,572\n2023 — 160,455 $ 1,718 $ 851 $ 2,569\n(1) Shares issued as interest payment on Convertible Notes.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of the Company’s fixed rate secured term loans was estimated using available market information and discounted cash flow analyses based on borrowing\nrates the Company believes it could obtain with similar terms and maturities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate\nsecured term loans, which were determined to be Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, was $470.1 million and $420.8 million, respectively, and the carrying value of such\nloans, was $456.6 million and $451.2 million, respectively.\nThe fair value of the Convertible Notes was estimated using available market information. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the\nConvertible Notes, which were determined to be Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy, was $183.4 million and $75.7 million, respectively, and the carrying value, was\n$26.3 million and $26.4 million, respectively.\n16\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\n7. Derivative Liabilities\nFair Value of Warrants\nThe Company utilized the Black-Scholes valuation method to calculate the fair value of the warrants noted below. Significant observable and unobservable inputs\ninclude stock price, conversion price, risk-free rate, term, likelihood of an event of contractual conversion and expected volatility. The Black-Scholes valuation method\nsimulation is a Level 3 valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators. The warrants\nnoted below contain terms and features that give rise to derivative liability classification.\nAs of the close of business on March 12, 2024 (the third anniversary of the issuance of that certain Common Stock Purchase Warrant, dated March 12, 2021, to the\nholders thereof (the \"Warrant\")), the exercise price of the Warrant was reset to an amount equal to the product of the Common Stock volume weighted average price as provided\nunder the Warrant, multiplied by a factor of 1.25 for Tranche A, 1.50 for Tranche B and 2.50 for Tranche C: approximately $83.43, $100.12, and $166.87, respectively.\nWarrants to purchase shares of Common Stock outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:\nWarrant Name Warrants Exercise Price Expiration Date\nWilmington Warrant Tranche A 142 $ 83.43 3/12/2026\nWilmington Warrant Tranche B 118 100.12 3/12/2026\nWilmington Warrant Tranche C 35 166.87 3/12/2026\nIn measuring the warrant liability, the Company used the following inputs:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommon Stock price $8.09 $0.31 (1)\nWeighted average contractual term to maturity (years) 1.5 years 2.2 years\nRange of expected market volatility % 247.25% 137.71%\nRange of risk free interest rate 3.82% 4.23%\n(1) Common stock price as of December 31, 2023 and was not restated for any subsequent stock splits.\nFair Value of Conversion Features Related to Convertible Notes\nThe Company identified certain embedded derivatives related to the conversion features of the Convertible Notes. In accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivatives and\nHedging Activities, the embedded conversion options contained within the Convertible Notes were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be\nadjusted to fair value through each reporting date. The Company utilized a binomial lattice model to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives. Significant observable\nand unobservable inputs include conversion price, stock price, dividend rate, expected volatility, risk-free rate, optional conversion price and term. The binomial lattice model is a\nLevel 3 valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators.\nIn measuring the embedded derivative liability, the Company used the following inputs:\n17\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nConversion price $2.38 (1) $0.16 (1) (2)\nCommon Stock price $8.09 $0.31 (2)\nContractual term to maturity (years) 7.3 years 8.0 years\nExpected market volatility % 155.00% 100.00%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.70% 3.90%\nTraded WHLRL price, % of par 594.00% 240.00%\n(1) Represents the volume weighted average of the Company's closing Common Stock price for the 10 trading days\npreceding the valuation, less a discount of 45%.\n(2) Value as of December 31, 2023 and was not restated for any subsequent stock splits.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in fair value of the Company's derivative liabilities, which include both the warrant and embedded derivative\nliabilities (in thousands, unaudited):\nNine Months Ended September\n30, 2024 Year Ended December 31, 2023\nBalance at the beginning of period $ 3,653 $ 7,111\nChanges in fair value - Warrants 9 (495)\nChanges in fair value - Convertible Notes 49,765 (2,963)\nBalance at end of period $ 53,427 $ 3,653\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nThe Company is the lessee under several ground leases and for its corporate headquarters; all are accounted for as operating leases. Most leases include one or more\noptions to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 5 to 50 years. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the weighted average remaining lease term of our\nleases was 36 and 36 years, respectively. Rent expense under the operating lease agreements was $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. Rent expense under the operating lease agreements was $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to commercial disputes. The Company\nbelieves that such litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or its results of operations. The Company\nrecords a liability when it considers the loss probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the below legal proceedings are in process:\nOn April 8, 2022, several purported holders of Cedar’s outstanding preferred stock filed a putative class action complaint against Cedar, Cedar's of Directors prior to the\nMerger, and WHLR in Montgomery County Circuit Court, Maryland entitled Sydney, et al. v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., (Case No. C-15-CV-22-001527).\nOn May 6, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Sydney filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Also on May, 6, 2022, a purported holder of Cedar’s outstanding preferred stock\nfiled a separate putative class action complaint against Cedar and Cedar's Board of Directors prior to the Cedar Acquisition in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Maryland, entitled Kim v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-01103. On May 11, 2022, Cedar, former Board of Directors of Cedar and the\nCompany removed the Sydney action to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Case No. 8:22-cv-01142-GLR. On May 16, 2022, the court ordered\nthat a hearing on the\n18\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(Unaudited)\nSydney Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction be held on June 22, 2022. On June 2, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Kim also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The\ncourt consolidated the motions for preliminary injunction.\nOn June 23, 2022, following a hearing, the court issued an order denying both motions for preliminary injunction, holding that the Plaintiffs in both cases were unlikely\nto succeed on the merits and that Plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was denied.\nBy order dated July 11, 2022, the court consolidated the Sydney and Kim cases and set an August 24, 2022 deadline for the Plaintiffs in both cases to file a consolidated\namended complaint. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on August 24, 2022. The amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of Cedar's\npreferred stock, among other things, claims for breach of contract against Cedar and Cedar's former Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary\ngoverning the terms of Cedar's preferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty against Cedar's former Board of Directors, and tortious interference and aiding and abetting\nbreach of fiduciary duty against the Company. On October 7, 2022, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss and\nfiled a motion to certify a question of law to Maryland’s Supreme Court. On August 1, 2023, the court issued a decision and order granting Defendants’ motions to\ndismiss.\nThe Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Case No. 23-1905. On September 4, 2024, the Fourth Circuit affirmed\nthe District Court order dismissing the complaint.\nDaniel Khoshaba v. Joseph D. Stilwell, et al., Civil Action No. 2:24CV237 in the United States District Court for the Easter District of Virginia. On April 10, 2024,\nDaniel Khoshaba, a holder of the Company's Common Stock and former CEO of the Company, filed a derivative action on behalf of the Company and putative class\naction on behalf of common stockholders who had not purchased the Convertible Notes in a rights offering alleging that the current and certain former directors of the\nCompany breached their duty to the Company and its common stockholders, and that certain of those directors and an officer of the Company were unjustly enriched.\nThe complaint primarily asserts the Defendants failed to take sufficient action to mitigate the potential dilution that could be caused by the redemption rights of holders\nof Series D Preferred Stock and that the Defendants should not have authorized dividends on the Convertible Notes sold in the rights offering to be paid in Series D\nPreferred Stock. The Company is named as a nominal defendant in the case and no claims are asserted against it. The Company is providing indemnification (including\nlegal fees and costs) to the directors and officer Defendants. On June 10, 2024, the individual Defendants and the other parties filed motions to dismiss the complaint.\nOn September 13, 2024, the District Court issued an opinion (i) granting the directors’ motion to dismiss the derivative claims, finding no demand was made and that\ndemand would not have been futile; (ii) granting the motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim against the directors based on a failure to plead facts supporting the\nelements of such a claim, and (ii) denying the motions to dismiss on all other grounds. At this juncture, discovery is ongoing and the outcome of the litigation remains\nuncertain.\n9.

No fractional shares were issued in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits. Stockholders who would\nhave otherwise been issued a fractional share of the Company’s Common Stock as a result of each of the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits instead received a cash payment in lieu of\nsuch fractional share in an amount equal to the applicable fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on Nasdaq on each effective date thereof,\nwithout any interest.\nAll share and share-related information presented in this Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements, has been retroactively adjusted to\nreflect the decreased number of shares resulting from the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits, unless otherwise noted.\nSeries D Preferred Stock - Redeemable Preferred Stock\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 6,000,000 authorized shares of Series D Preferred Stock, without par value with a $25.00 liquidation\npreference per share, or $96.9 million and $97.1 million in aggregate liquidation value, respectively.\nAfter September 21, 2023, each holder of the Series D Preferred Stock may, at such holder's option, request that the Company redeem any or all of such holder's shares\non a monthly basis (each redemption date, a \"Holder Redemption Date\") at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if\nany, to and including the Holder Redemption Date, payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the Company's option.

On February 5, 2024, the Board of\nDirectors agreed to increase the prior Excepted Holder Limits to permit this additional ownership and, accordingly, the Company entered into an amendment to the Excepted\nHolder Agreement with the Investors under which the Company increased the Capital Stock Excepted Holder Limit granted to Investors under the Excepted Holder Agreement to\n60% and the Common Stock Excepted Holder Limit to 90%.\n12.

In August 2022, the Company acquired Cedar Realty Trust. As a result of that acquisition, Cedar became a\nsubsidiary of the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company, through the Operating Partnership, owned and operated seventy-three retail shopping centers and two undeveloped properties\nin South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Connecticut, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Maryland and West\nVirginia. This list includes the properties acquired through the Cedar Acquisition.\nThe Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions, and is geographically concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and\nNortheast, which markets represent approximately 46%, 42% and 12% respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Company’s geographic concentration may cause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio.\nAdditionally, the Company’s retail shopping center properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a\nstore closure by, one or more of these tenants.\nRecent Trends and Activities\nDispositions\nDisposal Date Property Contract Price Gain (Loss) Net Proceeds\nSeptember 12, 2024 Kings Plaza - New Bedford, Massachusetts $ 14,200 $ 6,509 $ 13,746\nSeptember 11, 2024 Edenton Commons Land Parcel - Edenton, North Carolina 1,400 574 1,312\nJune 26, 2024 Oakland Commons - Bristol, Connecticut 6,000 3,363 5,662\nJune 18, 2024 Harbor Point Land Parcel - Grove, Oklahoma n/a (480) n/a\nOn June 18, 2024, the Company entered into the Harbor Point Settlement Agreement with the City of Grove, which provided for the transfer of the Harbor Point Land\nParcel and a one-time payment of $160 thousand to the City of Grove in exchange for a release of the Company from all increment taxes and other obligations under the\nEconomic Development Agreement the Company had entered into with the City of Grove and the dismissal of the litigation commenced by the City of Grove against the\nCompany.\nImpairment\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $1.2 million on Oregon Avenue, located in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania.\n25\nAssets Held for Sale\nAs of September 30, 2024, South Philadelphia, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has been classified as \"assets held for sale\" in the accompanying condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nCedar Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company entered into the Cedar Revolving Credit Agreement.

Interest payments were due monthly, and any outstanding principal was due at maturity on February 28, 2025. The Cedar\nRevolving Credit Agreement was collateralized by 6 properties, consisting of Carll's Corner, Fieldstone Marketplace, Oakland Commons, Kings Plaza, Oregon Avenue and South\nPhiladelphia, and proceeds were used for capital expenditures and tenant improvements for such properties. Upon the disposition of Kings Plaza the Cedar Revolving Credit\nAgreement was closed on September 12, 2024.\nTimpany Plaza Loan Agreement\nOn March 28, 2024, the Company received $1.0 million of $2.5 million in deferred loan proceeds under the Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement following the Company's\nsatisfaction of certain lease-related contingencies.

As a result of that transaction, the Company recognized a $0.7 million loss\n26\nwhich represents the fair value of the purchase price over the amount of principal reduction. The loss is included in \"other expense\" in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 28,105 shares of its Common Stock, upon the conversion of\nConvertible Notes by certain holders thereof, which resulted in an aggregate net loss on conversion of Convertible Notes of $0.4 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Conversion Price for the Convertible Notes was approximately $2.37 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (approximately 10.53\nshares of Common Stock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted).\nInterest expense on the Convertible Notes consisted of the following (in thousands, except for shares):\nSeries B Preferred Series D Preferred\nFor the Nine Months Ended Stock Stock Convertible Note\nSeptember 30, number of shares (1) number of shares (1) interest at 7% coupon Fair value adjustment Interest expense\n2024 — 109,676 $ 1,624 $ 948 $ 2,572\n2023 — 160,455 $ 1,718 $ 851 $ 2,569\n(1) Shares issued as interest payment on Convertible Notes.\nNoncontrolling Interests - Consolidated Subsidiary\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cedar repurchased and retired 77,075 shares of Cedar Series C Preferred Stock in a series of repurchase\ntransactions. The Cedar Series C Preferred Stock was repurchased for an aggregate of $1.0 million at an average price of $13.40 per share, representing a premium to the book\nvalue of $9.75 per share.

Big Lots leased five locations from us (collectively, the \"Big Lots Leases\"). At\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Big Lots Leases consist of 170,725 square feet and constitute approximately 1.5% of our portfolio's annualized base rent in the aggregate. At September\n30, 2024, amounts due from Big Lots were approximately $0.2 million, of which approximately $0.2 million were reserved for within our allowance for uncollectible tenant\nreceivables.\nBig Lots is entitled to certain rights under the Bankruptcy Code regarding the assumption or rejection of its leases, including the Big Lots Leases. We are currently\nnegotiating with Big Lots on potential modifications to certain of the Big Lots Leases that may be assumed and assigned as part of the currently pending or other sale of its\nbusiness. There can be no assurance that these negotiations will be successful and which Big Lots Leases, if any, will be assumed by Big Lots and assigned to a\n28\npurchaser of its business. If successful, any such modifications would not occur unless a sale of Big Lots’ business is agreed, the Bankruptcy Court approves the sale, and the sale\ncloses. Any Big Lots Leases not assumed by Big Lots will likely be rejected, which would entitle us to a rejection damages claim.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have made estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported\nperiods.

See Note 7 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for additional details.\nOther expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which\nprimarily consisted of capital structure costs, including repurchase of Convertible Notes and legal and other expenses incurred in connection with the 2024 Reverse Stock Splits,\nthe registration of our Common Stock to issue in settlement of Series D Preferred Stock redemptions and redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock by holders thereof. Other\nexpenses were $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which primarily consisted of capital structure costs to repurchase Convertible Notes and the Exchange\nOffer for the Company's outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, redemptions by holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and August 2023 Reverse Stock Split.\nSame-Property Net Operating Income\nSame-property net operating income (\"Same-Property NOI\") is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that Same-Property NOI\nis a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines Same-Property NOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property\nand related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because Same-Property NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and\namortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment charges, it provides a\nperformance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and\nthe impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses\nSame-Property NOI to evaluate its operating performance since Same-Property NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease\nstructure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. Properties are included in Same-Property NOI if they are owned and operated for the\nentirety of both periods being compared. Consistent with the capital treatment of such costs under GAAP, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other direct leasing\ncosts are excluded from Same-Property NOI.\n30\nThe most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is consolidated operating income. Same-Property NOI should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated\noperating income prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. Further, Same-Property NOI is a measure for which there is no standard industry definition\nand, as such, it is not consistently defined or reported on among the Company's peers, and thus may not provide an adequate basis for comparison among REITs.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of Same-Property NOI from operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, unaudited)\nOperating Income $ 13,894 $ 9,287 $ 32,894 $ 22,240\nAdd (deduct):\nGain on disposal of properties, net (7,083) (2,204) (9,966) (2,204)\nCorporate general & administrative 2,101 2,475 7,488 8,364\nImpairment charges 1,195 — 1,195 —\nDepreciation and amortization 6,241 6,875 19,212 21,642\nStraight-line rents (159) (285) (885) (1,004)\nAbove (below) market lease amortization, net (834) (1,232) (2,607) (3,865)\nOther non-property revenue (5) — (18) (55)\nNOI related to properties not defined as same-property (427) (448) (1,341) (1,398)\nSame-Property Net Operating Income $ 14,923 $ 14,468 $ 45,972 $ 43,720\nTotal Same-Property NOI was $14.9 million and $14.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 3.1%\ndue to a 1.1% increase in property revenue and a 2.4% decrease in property expenses.\nTotal Same-Property NOI was $46.0 million and $43.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of 5.2%\nprimarily due to a 3.5% increase in property revenue, partially offset by a 0.6% increase in property expenses.\nFunds from Operations\nWe use funds from operations (\"FFO\"), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations\nand liquidity. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"Nareit\") in\nits March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As defined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with\nGAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of loan origination costs), plus\nimpairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry analysts and equity REITs, including\nus, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding depreciation, FFO\nis a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management\nuses FFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary\nmeasure of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets\ndiminishes predictably over time, while historically real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative\nmeasurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results.\nWe believe the computation of FFO in accordance with Nareit's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating\nportfolio and affect the comparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash amortization on loans and\nacquisition costs. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these\nadjustments are appropriate in determining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In\n31\naddition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of\nadjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs.\nA reconciliation of net loss to FFO available to common stockholders and AFFO is shown in the table below (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet Loss $ (30,631) $ (11,368) $ (38,995) $ (13,071)\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets 6,241 6,875 19,212 21,642\nImpairment charges 1,195 — 1,195 —\nGain on disposal of properties, net (7,083) (2,204) (9,966) (2,204)\nFFO (30,278) (6,697) (28,554) 6,367\nPreferred stock dividends - undeclared (2,071) (2,415) (6,135) (6,940)\nDividends on noncontrolling interests preferred stock (2,674) (2,688) (8,050) (8,064)\nDeemed distribution related to repurchase of noncontrolling interests (284) — (284) —\nPreferred stock accretion adjustments 21 146 65 438\nFFO available to common stockholders and common unitholders (35,286) (11,654) (42,958) (8,199)\nOther non-recurring and non-cash expenses — 8 368 2,043\nGain on investment securities, net (591) (49) (779) (80)\nNet changes in fair value of derivative liabilities 39,299 11,163 49,774 6,281\nLoss on conversion of Convertible Notes 368 — 368 —\nGain on preferred stock redemptions (2,526) — (2,739) —\nStraight-line rental revenue, net straight-line expense (176) (293) (936) (997)\nDeferred financing cost amortization 803 636 2,157 2,357\nPaid-in-kind interest — — 2,031 2,006\nAbove (below) market lease amortization, net (834) (1,232) (2,607) (3,865)\nRecurring capital expenditures tenant improvement reserves (378) (404) (1,183) (1,221)\nAFFO $ 679 $ (1,825) $ 3,496 $ (1,675)\nOther non-recurring and non-cash expenses are costs of the Company that we believe will not be incurred on a go-forward basis. Other non-recurring expenses were\n$0.0 million and $0.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, a result of loan defeasance payments. Other non-recurring expenses were\n$0.0 million and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, a result of $1.8 million in loan defeasance payments and $0.2 million costs\nto demolish a decommissioned space not included in the Company's gross leasable area.\nInflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations\nSubstantially all of the Company’s leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include\nclauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and many of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition,\nmany of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However, significant inflation rate increases over a\nprolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of\nincome.\nInterest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of the Company's indebtedness and our\nrelatively low exposure to floating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases. The degree and pace of these changes have had and may\ncontinue to have impacts on our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n32\nAt September 30, 2024, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $55.0 million compared to consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash of $48.9 million at September 30, 2023. Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities were as follows (in thousands, unaudited):\nNine Months Ended September 30, Changes\n2024 2023 Dollars Percent\nOperating activities $ 20,588 $ 15,032 $ 5,556 37.0 %\nInvesting activities 1,562 (19,618) 21,180 108.0 %\nFinancing activities (6,938) (2,422) (4,516) (186.5)%\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities increased $5.6 million. Net cash provided by operating activities, before net changes in operating assets and liabilities, was\n$20.8 million and $15.2 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to (1) a $4.7 million decrease in corporate administrative expenses and other expenses and (2) a\n$2.3 million increase in Same-Property NOI, partially offset by (3) $1.0 million of Cedar Series C Preferred Stock repurchases and (4) a $0.4 million increase in cash paid for\ninterest.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows from investing activities increased $21.2 million, primarily due to (1) the proceeds from the sale of Kings Plaza, Oakland Commons and Edenton\nCommons Land Parcel, (2) the investment subscription with SAI of $0.5 million and $3.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and\n(3) the 2023 acquisition of the St. George Plaza Land Parcel, partially offset by (4) the increase in capital expenditures of $7.0 million and proceeds from the 2023 sale of Carll's\nCorner Outparcel.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows used in financing activities were $6.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $2.4\nmillion for the comparable period in 2023.\nFinancing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of:\nCash inflows:\n• $3.9 million 2024 loan refinancing activities, net;\n• $5.2 million draw on Cedar Revolving Credit Agreement; and\n• $2.5 million draw on Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement.\nCash outflows:\n• $8.1 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests;\n• $1.6 million payments for deferred financing costs;\n• $5.2 million payment on Cedar Revolving Credit Agreement;\n• $1.3 million repurchase of debt securities;\n• $1.0 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt;\n• $1.0 million repurchase of noncontrolling interests; and\n• $0.4 million defeasance payments.\nFinancing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of:\nCash inflows:\n• $16.4 million 2023 loan refinancing activities, net, including loan agreement for Timpany Plaza;\nCash outflows:\n• $8.1 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests;\n• $4.4 million payments for deferred financing costs;\n• $3.1 million repurchase of debt securities;\n33\n• $1.8 million defeasance payments; and\n• $1.4 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt.\nThe Company continues to endeavor to manage its debt prudently with the objective of achieving a conservative capital structure and minimizing leverage within the\nCompany. Our debt balances, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(unaudited)\nFixed-rate notes $ 500,331 $ 495,572\nTotal debt $ 500,331 $ 495,572\nThe weighted average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt were 5.53% and 7.8 years, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The weighted average interest rate and\nterm of our fixed-rate debt were 5.42% and 8.4 years, respectively, at September 30, 2023. We have $1.6 million of debt maturing during the twelve months ending\nSeptember 30, 2025. While we anticipate being able to refinance all the loans at reasonable market terms upon maturity, our inability to do so may materially impact our financial\nposition and results of operations. See Note 6 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for additional mortgage indebtedness details.\nNASDAQ Notices\nOn December 7, 2023, the listing qualifications staff (the \"Staff\") of Nasdaq notified the Company that based on the Common Stock’s bid price closing below $1.00 per\nshare for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule\") and that Company had a 180-day\ncompliance period. This rule requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet\nthe minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days.\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Staff notifying the Company that it had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule.\nOn June 28, 2024, the Staff notified the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4), which requires the Company to have a minimum\nof 500,000 \"Publicly Held Shares\" (defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5005(a)(35) as \"shares not held directly or indirectly by an officer, director or any person who is the beneficial\nowner of more than 10 percent of the total shares outstanding\") (the \"Publicly Held Shares Rule\"). Per the Staff's notice, the Company had until July 12, 2024 to submit to\nNasdaq a specific plan to achieve and sustain compliance.\nOn July 12, 2024, the Company timely submitted its plan of compliance to the Staff (the \"Compliance Plan\"). The Compliance Plan provided, among other things, that\nthe Company believes that, following its registration of approximately 20 million shares of its Common Stock with the SEC under the Prospectus, it will issue Common Stock in\nsettlement of Series D Preferred Stock redemptions commencing with the August 5, 2024 Holder Redemption Date in such an amount that, within the next couple of months and\ncertainly by December 25, 2024 (which is 180 days from the date of the Staff's letter, June 28, 2024), it will have achieved compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule.\nOn July 30, 2024, the Staff provided the Company with written notice of an extension through December 25, 2024 (the \"Compliance Deadline\") to regain compliance\nwith the Publicly Held Shares Rule. Per such notice, on or before the Compliance Deadline, the Company must file with the SEC and Nasdaq a public document containing its\ncurrent total shares of Common Stock outstanding and a beneficial ownership table in accordance with SEC proxy rules demonstrating compliance with the Publicly Held Shares\nRule.\nSubsequent to July 30, 2024, the Company has issued shares of its Common Stock in settlement of the Series D Preferred Stock redemptions and upon the conversion of\nthe Convertible Notes. The Company believes that, following such issuances, it is now in compliance with the Publicly Held Shares Rule because all shares so issued are\nconsidered Publicly Held Shares, and when added to the Publicly Held Shares already outstanding, exceed in the aggregate the minimum of 500,000 \"Publicly Held Shares\"\nrequired by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(4). As of November 6, the Company had 1,200,110 Publicly Held Shares outstanding.\n34\nMaterial Cash Requirements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur expected material cash requirements for the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 and thereafter are comprised of (i) contractually obligated expenditures; (ii)\nother essential expenditures; (iii) other investments; and (iv) repurchases of noncontrolling interests (Cedar securities, including the Cedar Tender Offer).\nThe primary liquidity needs of the Company, in addition to the funding of our ongoing operations, at September 30, 2024 are $1.6 million in principal and regularly\nscheduled payments due in the twelve months ended September 30, 2025 as described in Note 6 in the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, the Company has $3.1 million outstanding construction commitments at September 30, 2024.\nIn addition to liquidity required to fund debt payments, we may incur some level of capital expenditures during the year for our existing properties that cannot be passed\non to our tenants.\nTo meet these future liquidity needs, the Company:\n• had $37.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024;\n• had $17.9 million held in lender reserves for the purpose of tenant improvements, lease commissions, real estate taxes and insurance at September 30, 2024;\nand\n• intends to use cash generated from operations during the twelve months ending September 30, 2025.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to undertake measures to grow its operations and increase liquidity through delivering space currently leased but not yet occupied,\nbackfilling vacant anchor spaces, replacing tenants who are in default of their lease terms, increasing future lease revenue through tenant improvements partially funded by\nrestricted cash, disposition of non-core assets in the ordinary course of business and refinancing properties.\nIn order to continue qualifying as a REIT, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its \"REIT taxable income,\" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). Future dividend declarations will continue to be at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and will depend on the cash flow and financial\ncondition of the Company, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and such other factors as the Board of Directors may\ndeem relevant. The Company intends to continue to operate its business in a manner that will allow it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax requirements.\nOur success in executing on our strategy will dictate our liquidity needs going forward. If we are unable to execute in these areas, our ability to grow may be limited\nwithout additional capital.\nConvertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes have caused, and could continue to cause, substantial dilution of the Series D Preferred Stock and reduction in the value of any Series D Preferred\nStock if interest thereon continues to be paid in the future in shares of Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, depending on the prices at which the ongoing monthly redemptions\nof the Series D Preferred Stock occur, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes could continue to be repeatedly adjusted downwards, which has caused, and could continue\nto cause, significant downward pressure on the value of the Company’s Common Stock.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nAs of September 30, 2024, the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $61.7 million, with aggregate accrued and\nunpaid dividends in the amount of approximately $35.2 million, for a total liquidation value of $96.9 million. After September 21, 2023, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock\nhas the right, at such holder’s option, to request that the Company redeem any or all of such holder’s shares of Series D Preferred Stock on a monthly basis.\nAs the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock continue to exercise their redemption rights on a monthly basis, the Company will continue to pay the aggregate\nredemption price in shares of our Common Stock. The Company does not believe it is in its interests to liquidate assets or incur indebtedness to fund cash redemptions of the\nSeries D Preferred Stock and, accordingly, it has no intention of doing so. Therefore, the Company intends to continue to settle redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock in\nCommon Stock. We believe that the issuance of Common Stock to settle redemptions in Common Stock will continue to result in a substantial dilution of the outstanding\nCommon Stock.\n35\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal\nexecutive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Form\n10-Q) to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,\nmanagement recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n36\nTable of Contents\nPART II.

Business.\nOverview\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011 in connection with the Company's initial public offering. The Trust serves as the general\npartner of Wheeler REIT, L.P. (the \"Operating Partnership\"), which was formed as a Virginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. Prior to the Cedar Acquisition (as defined below), substantially all\nof our assets were held by, and all of our operations were conducted through, our Operating Partnership. At December 31, 2023, the Company owned 99.13% of the Operating Partnership.\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed a merger transaction with Cedar Realty Trust, Inc. (\"Cedar\" or \"CDR\"). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding\nshares of Cedar’s common stock (the \"Cedar Acquisition\"), which ceased to be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"). Cedar’s outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and\n6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE. As a result, Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT. Cedar's assets are held by, and its operations are\nconducted through, its operating partnership, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, LP.\nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). To qualify as a REIT under those provisions,\nthe Company must have a preponderant percentage of its assets invested in, and income derived from, real estate and related sources. The Company is a fully-integrated, self-managed commercial\nreal estate investment company that owns, leases and operates income-producing retail properties with a primary focus on grocery-anchored centers.\nFor additional information on recent business developments, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.\nPortfolio\nOur portfolio contains retail properties in secondary and tertiary markets, with a particular emphasis on grocery-anchored retail centers. Our properties are in communities that have stable\ndemographics and have historically exhibited favorable trends, such as strong population and income growth. We generally lease our properties to national and regional retailers that offer consumer\ngoods and services and generate regular consumer traffic. We believe our tenants carry goods and offer services that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers’\ndisposable income, generating more predictable property level cash flows.\nThe Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions. As of December 31, 2023, we own a portfolio consisting of seventy-nine properties,\nincluding seventy-five retail shopping centers, totaling 8,142,065 leasable square feet which is 93.7% leased (our \"operating portfolio\"), and four undeveloped land parcels totaling approximately 61\nacres. The properties are geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast, which markets represented approximately 45%, 40% and 15%, respectively, of the total annualized base\nrent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2023.\nNo tenant represents greater than approximately 6% of the Company’s annualized base rent or 7% of gross leasable square footage. The top 10 tenants account for 23.4% or $17.7 million of\nannualized base rent and 26.2% or $2.1 million of gross leasable square footage at December 31, 2023.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have 52 full-time employees. We seek to hire experienced leaders and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Employees are offered\nflexibility to meet personal and family needs, which was further expanded when the COVID-19 pandemic began. In addition to medical insurance support, the Company offers wellness programs,\nincluding free short- and long-term disability insurance, free basic life insurance policy with accidental death and dismemberment coverage, employee assistance programs that include emotional\nhealth support, gym memberships,\n3\nvolunteer time off and tuition assistance. Tuition assistance includes assistance to learn a new language as the Company identifies opportunities to better serve a diverse tenant base.\nThe Company takes steps to measure and improve upon its level of employee engagement and to create\na diverse and inclusive workplace, all while creating value for our stakeholders. The Company’s employees are expected to exhibit honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. Every year,\nthe Company requires its employees to review and certify their compliance with the Company's various policies, including its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nBusiness Objectives and Investment Strategy\nOur primary business objective is to maximize the value of our portfolio. We intend to achieve this objective utilizing the following investment strategies:\n• Focus on necessity-based retail. Own and operate retail properties that serve the essential day-to-day shopping needs of the surrounding communities. These necessity-based centers attract\nhigh levels of daily traffic resulting in cross-selling of goods and services from our tenants. The majority of our tenants provide non-cyclical consumer goods and services that are less impacted\nby fluctuations in the economy. We believe these centers that provide essential goods and services such as groceries result in a stable, lower-risk portfolio of retail investment properties.\n• Focus on secondary and tertiary markets with strong demographics and demand. Our properties are in markets that have strong demographics such as population density, population stability,\nconsistent tenant sales trends and growth in household income. We seek to identify new tenants and renew leases with existing tenants in these locations that support the need for necessity-\nbased retail and limited new supply. We aim to identify and pursue attractive investment opportunities in regions with low taxes and a pro-business environment.\n• Increase operating income through leasing strategies and expense management. We employ intensive lease management strategies to optimize occupancy. Management has extensive\nexpertise in acquiring and managing under-performing properties and increasing operating income through more effective leasing strategies and expense management. Our leases generally\nrequire the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of the expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, and managing the shopping center and the common areas, along with\nthe associated insurance costs and real estate taxes. In many cases, the tenant is either fully or partially responsible for all maintenance of the property, thereby limiting our financial exposure\ntowards maintaining the center and increasing our net income. We refer to this arrangement as a \"triple net lease.\"\n• Selectively utilize our capital to improve retail properties. We intend to make capital investments where the risk adjusted returns on such capital is accretive to our stockholders. We allocate\ncapital to value-added improvements of retail properties to increase rents, extend long-term leases with anchor tenants and increase occupancy. We selectively allocate capital to revenue\nenhancing projects that we believe will improve the market position of a given property.\n• Recycling and sensible management of our property portfolio. We intend to sell non-income producing land parcels or non-core assets utilizing sales proceeds to deleverage the balance sheet\nand invest in higher yielding opportunities. Properties may be slated for disposition based upon management's periodic review of our portfolio, and approval by our Board of Directors (the\n\"Board of Directors\").\n• Strategy for optimizing capital structure. The Company seeks to mitigate risk and optimize its capital structure through continuous focus on maintaining prudent leverage and lengthy average\ndebt maturities, as well as access to a diverse selection of capital sources, including the secured and unsecured debt markets, unsecured lines of credit, and other sources.\n• Strategy for integrating acquisitions. As the Company undertakes acquisitions, we seek to thoughtfully integrate the acquired properties and any software and personnel to maximize\nefficiencies both at the property and corporate level.\nGovernmental Regulations Affecting Our Properties\nWe and our properties are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health, safety, tax and similar laws. The application of these laws to a specific property that we own\ndepends on a variety of property-specific circumstances,\n4\nincluding the current and former uses of the property, the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property. Neither existing environmental, health, safety and similar laws\nnor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe they will for the fiscal year\nending December 31, 2024. In addition, we have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have\nowned in the past. However, we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future. We have no current plans for substantial\ncapital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental, health, safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance that covers a number of environmental risks for most of our\nproperties.\nCompetition\nNumerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing of properties. Some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than\nwe do, although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market. This competition may\ninterfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants, leading to increased vacancy rates and/or reduced rents and adversely affect our ability to minimize operating expenses.\nRetailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers, outlet stores, discount shopping clubs, superstores, and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and\nservices, such as direct mail. This competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants.\nClimate\nSome of our properties could be subject to natural or other disasters. In addition, we may acquire properties that are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters, such as earthquakes\nand droughts. Properties could also be affected by increases in the frequency or severity of tornadoes, hurricanes or other severe weather, whether such increases are caused by global climate changes\nor other factors. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operating costs, increase future\nproperty insurance costs, and/or negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space. If insurance is unavailable to us, or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover\nbusiness interruption or losses from such events, our earnings, liquidity and/or capital resources could be adversely affected. While several of our properties are located in areas that have experienced\nhurricanes, tornados, severe rain storms, or snow during the past two years, there has been no substantial damage or change in operations related to weather events.\nInsurance\nThe Company carries comprehensive liability, property, fire, flood, wind, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio\nunder an insurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors’,\nofficers’, entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy specifications\nand insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to\nfully cover losses. Increases in the occurrence of natural disasters and severe weather patterns have led to a consistent increase in overall rates, deductibles and valuations from insurance carriers,\nwhich have resulted in increased costs of necessary insurance required to protect our assets.\nAvailable Information\nWe are subject to the information reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Therefore, we file reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\"). The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the\nSEC, including us.\nAdditionally, we make available free of charge through our website http://www.whlr.us our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial\nstatements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, including exhibits, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or\nfurnish such materials to the SEC. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form\n5\n10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our website is intended to be inactive textual references only.\nInvestors and others should note that we currently announce material information using SEC filings and press releases. In the future, we will continue to use these channels to distribute\nmaterial information about the Company, and may also utilize public conference calls, webcasts, our website and/or various social media sites to communicate important information about the\nCompany, key personnel, trends, corporate initiatives and other matters. Information that we post on our website or on social media channels could be deemed material; therefore, investors, the media,\nour customers, business partners and others interested in the Company should review the information posted on our website as well as on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/company/wheeler-real-\nestate-investment-trust/, in addition to following the Company’s press releases and SEC filings. Any updates to the list of social media channels we may use to communicate material information will\nbe posted on the Investor Relations page of our website at http://www.whlr.us.

Risk Factors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity.\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company depends on the proper functioning, availability and security of its information systems, including financial, data processing, communications and operating systems. Several\ninformation systems are software applications provided by third parties. Although risks from cybersecurity threats have to date not materially affected, and we do not believe they are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, like other companies in our industry, we could, from time to time, experience threats and security incidents\nrelated to our and our third-party vendors’ information systems, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data, and other electronic security breaches. Such cybersecurity\nattacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. While we employ a number of measures to\nprevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cybersecurity attack. A cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential\ninformation of our employees, tenants and vendors. A successful cybersecurity attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations.\nAssessment, identification and management of cybersecurity related risks are integrated into our overall risk management process. Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe\nwe evaluate to assess top risks to the Company at least annually. To the extent our processes identify a heightened cybersecurity related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop risk mitigation plans,\nwhich are then tracked to completion.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated oversight of cybersecurity risk strategy and governance and of other information\ntechnology risks to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Audit Committee\"). The Audit Committee reports to the full Board of Directors regarding its activities, including those related\nto cybersecurity. Senior management, including the Company's CEO, CFO, and General Counsel, is responsible for assessing and managing cybersecurity risk, and provides briefings regarding the\nassessment and management of such risk to the Audit Committee, which then reports, as necessary, to the Board of Directors. Although members of our senior management do not have direct\ncybersecurity expertise obtained through certifications, their experience managing the Company, which includes consulting and coordinating as necessary with a third party information technology\nexpert referred to below, enables them to effectively assess and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats.\n6\nThe Company retained an information technology expert third party company to assist in managing relevant risks. In particular, the Company outsources its information technology function\nand monitoring to a third party provider whereby it benefits from a professionally managed network monitoring, management, maintenance, detection and response system and a 24/7 security\noperations center with both onsite and remote support services. Any cybersecurity incident would be reported to the Company promptly by our third party consultant and material and potentially\nmaterial incidents would be assessed by management and the Audit Committee for remediation and future prevention and detection.\nThe Company, at least annually, updates its policies or procedures that could help mitigate cybersecurity risks. Notwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not\nbe successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. The Company has incorporated cybersecurity coverage in its insurance policies;\nhowever, there is no assurance that the insurance the Company maintains will cover all cybersecurity breaches or that policy limits will be sufficient to cover all related losses.\n7\nItem 2.

As part of our ongoing property management, we conduct regular physical property reviews to improve our properties, react to\nchanging market conditions and ensure proper maintenance.\nOur leasing representatives are experienced in the markets in which we operate; they are familiar with current tenants and potential local, regional, and national tenants that would\ncomplement our current tenant base. We study demographics, customer sales, merchandising mix and cultivate tenant relationships to optimize the sales performance of our centers and thereby\nincrease rents. We believe this hands-on approach maximizes the value of our shopping centers.\nItem 3.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “WHLR.”\nApproximate Number of Holders of Our Common Stock\nAs of March 4, 2024 there were 147 holders of record of our Common Stock. This number excludes stockholders whose stock is held in nominee or street name by brokers.\nDividend Policy\nIn March 2018, the Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on our Common Stock. The Board of Directors also suspended the quarterly dividends on shares of our Series A\nPreferred Stock (\"Series A Preferred\"), Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series B Preferred\") and Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Series D Preferred Stock\"), beginning with\nthe three months ended December 31, 2018.\nAs the Company has failed to pay cash dividends on the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock, the annual dividend rate on the Series D Preferred Stock has increased to 10.75%; commencing\non the first day after the first missed quarterly payment, January 1, 2019 and will continue until such time as the Company has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred\nStock in full. Commencing September 21, 2023, the Series D Preferred Stock holders are entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of 12.75% increased by 2% of the liquidation\npreference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 16%, including the 2% default rate. See Note 10, Equity and Mezzanine Equity, to the\naccompanying audited consolidated financial statements.\n11\nAs a result of the dividend suspension on the Series D Preferred Stock, our Charter provides that no dividends may be declared or paid on the Common Stock or on our other outstanding\npreferred until all accumulated accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been paid in full. At this time, the Company does not intend to pay dividends other than those\nrequired dividend distributions, if any, that will enable us to maintain our REIT status and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay income and excise taxes. See “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Future Liquidity Needs.”\nItem 6. Reserved\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included\nin this Form 10-K. All per share amounts, common units and shares outstanding, stock-based compensation, warrants, and conversion features of our Convertible Notes for all periods presented\nreflect the one-for-ten Reverse Stock Split, which took effect on August 17, 2023. For more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information, you should read the\nnotes to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a Maryland corporation focused on owning, leasing and operating income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing retail\nproperties. We have targeted properties located within developed areas, commonly referred to as in-fill, that are surrounded by communities that have strong demographics and dynamic, diversified\neconomies that will continue to generate jobs and future demand for commercial real estate. Our primary target markets include the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Northeast.\nOur portfolio is comprised of seventy-five retail shopping centers and four undeveloped land parcels. Twenty-one of these properties are located in South Carolina, twelve in Georgia, ten in\nVirginia, eight in Pennsylvania, six in North Carolina, four in Massachusetts, four in New Jersey, three in Florida, three in Connecticut, two in Kentucky, two in Tennessee, one in Alabama, one in\nMaryland, one in West Virginia, and one in Oklahoma. The Company’s portfolio had total gross rentable space of approximately 8,142,000 square feet and a leased level of approximately 93.7% at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn August 2022, the Company acquired Cedar, and as a result of such transaction acquired 19 shopping centers (the majority of which are grocery-anchored), which increased the Company’s\npresence in the Northeast.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is not a variable interest entity,\nas defined under the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, and we evaluated such entity under the voting model\nand concluded we should consolidate the entity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting rights and that\nother equity holders do not have substantive participating rights.\nRecent Trends and Activities\nThere have been several significant events in 2023 that have impacted our Company. These events are summarized below.\nSeries D Preferred Stock - Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation\nOn November 22, 2022, the Company commenced an exchange offer (the \"Exchange Offer\"), which, as subsequently amended, provided for the exchange of up to 2,112,103 outstanding shares of\nSeries D Preferred Stock, representing 67% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, for (i) 6.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2028, and (ii) Common Stock, in each case to\nhave been newly issued by the Company. As of the expiration of the Exchange Offer on January 20, 2023, 864,391 shares of Series D Preferred Stock (representing 26.8% of the total outstanding\nSeries D Preferred Stock) had been validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Exchange Offer. Accordingly, the condition that the holders of at least\n12\n66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock validly tender their Series D Preferred Stock into the Exchange Offer had not been satisfied and the Exchange Offer expired on January\n20, 2023.\nSeries D Preferred Stock - Redemptions\nAfter September 21, 2023, each holder of the Series D Preferred Stock has the right, at such holder’s option, to request that the Company redeem any or all of such holder’s shares on a\nmonthly basis (each redemption date, a “Holder Redemption Date”), at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the\nHolder Redemption Date, payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the Company's option. Redemptions commenced on September 22, 2023, and the first Holder\nRedemption Date was October 5, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company processed 175 redemption requests, collectively redeeming 864,070 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Accordingly, during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the Company issued 52,788,687 shares of Common Stock in settlement of an aggregate redemption price of approximately $32.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had received requests to redeem 9,843 shares of Series D Preferred Stock with\nrespect to the January 2024 Holder Redemption Date. As such, the redemption of these Series D Preferred Stock is considered certain at December 31, 2023 and the liquidation value associated with\nthese shares of $0.4 million is presented as a liability.\nDispositions\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no assets held for sale.\nThe following properties were sold during the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nDisposal Date Property Contract Price Gain Net Proceeds\nJuly 11, 2023 Carll's Corner Outparcel - Bridgeton, New Jersey $ 3,000 $ 2,204 $ 2,759\nLand Acquisitions\nOn February 21, 2023, the Company purchased a 2.5 acre land parcel adjacent to St. George Plaza, located in St.\nGeorge, South Carolina, for $0.2 million.\nOn August 18, 2023, the Company purchased a 3.25 acre land parcel within Devine Street, located in Columbia, South Carolina, for $4.1 million (the \"Devine Street Land Acquisition\"). The\nDevine Street Land Acquisition terminated the Company's ground lease associated with this property, a savings of $0.3 million in annual ground rent.\nTerm Loan Agreement, 12 properties\nOn May 5, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement, 12 properties\") for $61.1 million at a fixed rate of 6.194% and interest-only payments due monthly\nthrough June 2025. Commencing in July 2025, until the maturity date of June 1, 2033, monthly principal and interest payments will be $0.4 million. Loan proceeds were used to refinance loans on 12\nproperties, including $1.1 million in defeasance.\nTerm Loan Agreement, 8 properties\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the \"Term Loan Agreement, 8 properties\") for $53.1 million at a fixed rate of 6.24% and interest-only payments due monthly\nthrough June 2028. Commencing in July 2028, until the maturity date of June 10, 2033, monthly principal and interest payments will be $0.3 million. Loan proceeds were used to refinance loans on 8\nproperties, including $0.7 million in defeasance.\nTimpany Plaza Loan Agreement\nOn September 12, 2023, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the \"Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement\") for $11.6 million at a fixed rate of 7.27% with interest-only payments due\nmonthly for the first twelve months. Commencing on\n13\nSeptember 12, 2024, until the maturity date of September 12, 2028, monthly principal and interest payments will be made based on a 30-year amortization schedule calculated based on the principal\namount as of that time. On the closing date, the Company received $9.1 million of the $11.6 million, and the remaining $2.5 million will be received upon the satisfaction of certain lease-related\ncontingencies within one year of the agreement date. The Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement is collateralized by the Timpany Plaza shopping center.\nConvertible Notes\nThe Company’s Convertible Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.00% per annum. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 30 and December 31 of each\nyear.\nInterest expense on the Convertible Notes consists of the following (in thousands, except for shares):\nSeries B Preferred Series D Preferred Stock Convertible Note interest\nFor the years ended December 31, number of shares (1) number of shares (1) at 7% coupon Fair value adjustment Interest expense\n2023 — 306,380 $ 2,259 $ 1,649 $ 3,908\n2022 1,511,541 — $ 2,310 $ 1,429 $ 3,739\n(1) Shares issued as interest payment on Convertible Notes.\nOn June 8, 2023, the Company paid down $0.6 million of the Convertible Notes through an open market purchase\nof 23,784 units totaling $1.2 million. On September 11, 2023, the Company paid down $0.9 million of the Convertible Notes through an open market purchase of 35,000 units totaling $1.9 million.\nAs a result of these transactions the Company recognized a $1.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 which represents the fair value of the purchase over principal pay down. The loss is\nincluded in \"other expense\" on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 5, 2023, the Conversion Price (as defined below) for the Convertible Notes was approximately $0.21 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (approximately 116.46\nshares of Common Stock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted).\nAs of February 5, 2024, the Conversion Price for the Convertible Notes was approximately $0.12 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (approximately 209.84 shares of Common\nStock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted).\nRelated Party Transactions\nManagement and Leasing Services for Cedar\nThe Company performs property management and leasing services for Cedar, a subsidiary of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Cedar paid the Company\n$2.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively, for these services. Related party amounts due to the Company from Cedar were $8.1 million and $7.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.\nInvestment in Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company subscribed for an investment in the amount of $3.0 million for limited partnership interests in Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., a Delaware limited\npartnership (“SAI”). On September 1, 2023 and November 30, 2023, the Company subscribed for additional investments each in the amount of $3.5 million for limited partnership interests in SAI.\nThe Company’s SAI investment is accounted for under the equity method and measured at net asset value as a practical expedient and has not been classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nAll gains and losses, realized and unrealized, and fees are recorded through \"gains (losses) on investment securities, net\" on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the\nfair value of the Company’s SAI investment was $10.7 million, which includes $10.0 million from subscriptions and $0.2 million in fees. Unrealized gains on investment securities, net of fees were\n$0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n14\nThe Company’s initial subscription in SAI was approved by the disinterested directors of the Company, and, after the formation of the Related Person Transactions Committee, the further\nsubscriptions in SAI were approved by that Committee.\nExcepted Holder Limits\nOn December 4, 2023, the Board of Directors, under the terms of the Charter, created a Capital Stock Excepted Holder Limit of 55% and a Common Stock Excepted Holder Limit of 86% for\neach of SAI, Stilwell Activist Fund, L.P., Stilwell Value Partners VII, L.P., and Stilwell Associates, L.P. (collectively, the “Investors”). Joseph Stilwell, a member of our Board of Directors, is the\nmanaging member and owner of Stilwell Value LLC, which is the general partner of each of the Investors.\nOn December 5, 2023, the Company entered into an Excepted Holder Agreement with the Investors with respect to such limits. The Capital Stock Excepted Holder Limit provides that the\nInvestors are exempted from the Charter’s aggregate stock ownership limit of not more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's capital stock (as\ncalculated under the definitions of “Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit” and “Beneficial Ownership” in the Charter) and are instead subject to the percentage limit established by the Board of\nDirectors. The Common Stock Excepted Holder Limit provides that the Investors are exempted from the Charter’s common stock ownership limit of not more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of\nthe outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock (as calculated under the definitions of “Common Stock Ownership Limit” and “Beneficial Ownership” in the Charter) and is instead subject to\nthe percentage limit established by the Board of Directors. The Capital Stock Excepted Holder Limit and Common Stock Excepted Holder Limit will automatically terminate upon reduction of the\nInvestors’ capital stock and Common Stock ownership below 9.8%, respectively.\nIn consideration of the grant of these Excepted Holder Limits, the Investors concurrently entered into a one-year letter agreement with the Company whereby each Investor agreed that it will\nnot exercise its right to convert the Convertible Notes into shares of Common Stock to the extent that such conversion would result in such Investor, whether on its own or as part of a “group” within\nthe meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), becoming the direct or indirect “beneficial owner”, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the\nExchange Act, of common equity of the Company representing 50% or more of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of common equity of the Company that is entitled to vote generally in\nthe election of directors.\nFollowing the transfer of Common Stock to the Investors in consideration of the February 2024 Series D Preferred Stock redemptions made by the Investors, the Investors would have\nbeneficially owned or constructively owned an amount of capital stock in excess of the Prior Excepted Holder Limits. On February 5, 2024, the Board of Directors agreed to increase the prior\nExcepted Holder Limits to permit this additional ownership and, accordingly, the Company entered into an amendment to the Excepted Holder Agreement with the Investors under which the Company\nincreased the Capital Stock Excepted Holder Limit granted to Investors under the Excepted Holder Agreement to 60% and the Common Stock Excepted Holder Limit to 90%.\nPreferred Dividends\nCommencing September 21, 2023, the Series D Preferred Stock holders were entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of 12.75% increased by 2% of the liquidation\npreference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 16%, including the 2% default rate. The total cumulative dividends in arrears for Series\nD Preferred Stock is $32.3 million as of December 31, 2023 (per share $12.48).\nNew Leases and Leasing Renewals\nThe following table presents selected lease activity statistics for our properties:\n15\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRenewals(1):\nLeases renewed with rate increase (sq feet) 712,873 676,814\nLeases renewed with rate decrease (sq feet) — 62,771\nLeases renewed with no rate change (sq feet) 295,173 284,461\nTotal leases renewed (sq feet) 1,008,046 1,024,046\nLeases renewed with rate increase (count) 116 104\nLeases renewed with rate decrease (count) — 11\nLeases renewed with no rate change (count) 20 28\nTotal leases renewed (count) 136 143\nOptions exercised (count) 31 18\nWeighted average on rate increases (per sq foot) $ 0.86 $ 1.29\nWeighted average on rate decreases (per sq foot) $ — $ (1.17)\nWeighted average rate (per sq foot) $ 0.61 $ 0.78\nWeighted average change over prior rates 6.54 % 8.29 %\nNew Leases(1) (2):\nNew leases (sq feet) 435,099 374,149\nNew leases (count) 70 79\nWeighted average rate (per sq foot) $ 12.42 $ 11.27\n(1) Lease data presented is based on average rate per square foot over the renewed or new lease term.\n(2) The Company does not include ground leases entered into for the purposes of new lease sq feet and weighted average rate (per sq foot) on new leases.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, which have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates,\nassumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various\nother assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe critical accounting estimates and policies summarized in this section are discussed in further detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form\n10-K. We believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition. The\nfollowing accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management’s judgment about matters that have a significant level of uncertainty at the time the\naccounting estimates are made, and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or operating results.\n16\nRevenue Recognition\nPrincipal components of our total revenues include base and percentage rents and tenant reimbursements. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts, which\nincludes combining base rent and tenant reimbursement revenue. We accrue minimum (base) rent on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or\ndeferred rent liability being recorded on the balance sheet. Certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants’ sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent) which\nwe recognize when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements. Although we periodically review the valuation of the asset/liability resulting from the straight-line\naccounting treatment of our leases in light of any changes in lease terms, financial condition or other factors concerning our tenants, they are subject to uncertainty. These assessments are inherently\nsensitive as they are based on the judgment of management and information available at the time of evaluation.\nRents and Other Tenant Receivables\nWe record a tenant receivable for amounts due from tenants such as base rents, tenant reimbursements and other charges allowed under the lease terms. We periodically review tenant\nreceivables for collectability and determine the need for an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and other accounts receivable based upon customer creditworthiness (including\nexpected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. We consider a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the\nterms of the lease; our standard lease form considers a rent charge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions\nper the lease.\nAcquired Properties and Lease Intangibles\nWe allocate the purchase price of the acquired properties to land, building and improvements, identifiable intangible assets and to the acquired liabilities based on their respective fair values.\nIdentifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquired out-of-market leases, tenant relationships, the value of in-place leases and ground. We determine fair value based on estimated cash flow\nprojections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating\nresults, known trends and specific market and economic conditions that may affect the property. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, tenant\nimprovements, legal and other related expenses. Such amounts are based on estimates and forecasts which, by their nature, are highly subjective and may result in future changes in the event forecasts\nare not realized.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment\nproperties may not be recoverable, with an evaluation performed at least annually. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property’s cash flows, occupancy and fair market\nvalue. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the\ncarrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using\nunobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level\nvaluation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nThe Company may decide to sell properties. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The Company estimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on similar real estate\nsales transactions. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 and 3 inputs. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for\nsimilar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and inputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that\nare supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n17\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock\npurchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are\naccounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated\nstatement of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nThe Series D Preferred Stock was initially classified as mezzanine equity because the redemption provisions were conditional upon the occurrence of an event that was not certain. The Series\nD Preferred Stock was valued at net proceeds plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In 2023, this event became certain and in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 480, the\nSeries D Preferred Stock was revalued at the redemption price which includes undeclared dividends, representing liquidation value. The adjustment to liquidation value was recognized in accumulated\ndeficit as an adjustment to redemption value. Additionally, in accordance with ASC 480, as holders exercise their redemption rights the Series D Preferred Stock becomes mandatorily redeemable and\nthe liquidation value of their exercise is classified as a liability.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $39.8 million compared to consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $55.9 million\nat December 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31, Year Over Year Change\n2023 2022 $ %\nOperating activities $ 20,934 $ 30,758 $ (9,824) (31.9)%\nInvesting activities $ (31,521) $ (133,512) $ 101,991 76.4 %\nFinancing activities $ (5,471) $ 118,200 $ (123,671) (104.6)%\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities were $20.9 million and $30.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of 31.9% or $9.8\nmillion primarily due to (1) a $12.5 million decrease in net changes in operating assets and liabilities due to timing of receipts and payments, (2) an $11.1 increase in corporate administrative\nexpenses, interest expense and other expenses, offset by (3) a $13.5 million increase in net operating income (\"NOI\") not attributable to same properties a result of the Cedar Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities were $31.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $133.5 million during the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 76.4% primarily due to (1) $135.5 million costs due to the Cedar Acquisition, described in Note 3 included in the accompanying audited\nconsolidated financial statements, partially offset by (2) $11.5 million increase in capital expenditures, (3) $10.0 million subscription in SAI, (4) $4.2 million in 2023 acquisitions and (5) $7.8 million\ndecrease in cash received from disposal of properties.\nFinancing Activities\nOur cash flows used in financing activities were $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to cash flows from financing activities of $118.2 million for the comparable\nperiod in 2022.\nFinancing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily consists of:\n18\nCash inflows:\n• $16.4 million 2023 loan refinancing activities, net, including the Timpany Plaza Loan Agreement;\nCash outflows:\n• $10.8 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests;\n• $4.4 million payments for deferred financing costs;\n• $1.8 million defeasance payments;\n• $3.1 million repurchase of debt securities; and\n• $1.8 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt.\nFinancing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of:\nCash inflows:\n• $19.3 million 2022 loan refinancing activities, net; and\n• $130.0 million loan related to the Cedar Acquisition;\nCash outflows:\n• $12.7 million payments for deferred financing costs;\n• $4.4 million scheduled loan principal payments on debt;\n• $5.6 million loan principal payment related to the sale of Butler Square;\n• $3.1 million loan principal payment related to the sale of Walnut Hill Plaza;\n• $2.7 million for distributions paid on noncontrolling interests; and\n• $2.6 million defeasance payments.\nThe Company continues to endeavor to manage its debt prudently with the objective of achieving a conservative capital structure and minimizing leverage within the Company. Our debt\nbalances, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nFixed-rate notes $ 495,572 $ 482,447\nTotal debt $ 495,572 $ 482,447\nThe weighted average interest rate and term of our fixed-rate debt are 5.42% and 8.2 years, respectively, at December 31, 2023.

We have $7.2 million of debt maturing during the year ending December 31, 2024. While we anticipate being able to refinance all\nthe loans at reasonable market terms upon maturity, our inability to do so may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. See Note 6 to the accompanying audited consolidated\nfinancial statements for additional mortgage indebtedness details.\nNasdaq Notices\nOn June 26, 2023, the listing qualifications staff (the \"Staff\") of Nasdaq notified the Company that based on the Common Stock’s bid price closing below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive\nbusiness days, the Company no longer complied with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \"Bid Price Rule\") and that it had 180 calendar days to regain compliance. This rule requires listed securities\nto maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a\nperiod of 30 consecutive business days.\nIn response, the Board of Directors determined that it was advisable to amend the Company’s charter to effect a one-for-ten reverse stock split of the Company’s Common Stock, which\nreverse stock split was subsequently effected on August 17, 2023.\n19\nPrimarily as a result of this reverse stock split, the closing bid price of the Company’s Common Stock was at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, and the\nCompany regained compliance with Nasdaq’s Bid Price Rule on September 1, 2023.\nHowever, the Company’s Common Stock bid price has again come under significant downward pressure primarily as a result of the Company’s Series D Preferred Stock holders having the\nright, at each such holder’s option, after September 21, 2023, to require the Company to redeem on a monthly basis any or all of such holder’s shares of Series D Preferred Stock at a redemption price\nof $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the Holder Redemption Date. This holder redemption price may be paid in cash or in equal value\nof shares of Common Stock, or in any combination thereof, at the Company’s option.\nThe Company has chosen to pay the monthly redemption price in equal value of shares of Common Stock.\nOn December 7, 2023, the Staff again notified the Company that based on the Common Stock’s bid price closing below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no\nlonger complied with Nasdaq’s Bid Price Rule and that it had a 180-day compliance period until June 4, 2024 to regain compliance.\nMaterial Cash Requirements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur expected material cash requirements for the year ended December 31, 2024 and thereafter are comprised of (i) contractually obligated expenditures; (ii) other essential expenditures; and\n(iii) opportunistic expenditures.\nThe primary liquidity needs of the Company, in addition to the funding of our ongoing operations, at December 31, 2023 are $7.2 million in principal and regularly scheduled payments due\nin the year ended December 31, 2024 as described in Note 6 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, the Company has $3.1 million outstanding construction commitments at December 31, 2023.\nIn addition to liquidity required to fund debt payments and construction commitments, we may incur some level of capital expenditures during the year for our existing properties that cannot\nbe passed on to our tenants.\nTo meet these future liquidity needs, the Company:\n• had $18.4 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023;\n• had $21.4 million held in lender reserves for the purpose of tenant improvements, lease commissions, real estate taxes and insurance at December 31, 2023; and\n• intends to use cash generated from operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to undertake measures to grow its operations and increase liquidity through delivering space currently leased but not yet occupied, backfilling vacant anchor\nspaces, replacing tenants who are in default of their lease terms, increasing future lease revenue through tenant improvements partially funded by restricted cash, disposition of non-core assets in the\nordinary course of business and refinancing properties.\nOur success in executing on our strategy will dictate our liquidity needs going forward. If we are unable to execute in these areas, our ability to grow may be limited without additional\ncapital.\nConvertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes could have the effect of causing, if interest is paid in the future in shares of Series D Preferred Stock, substantial dilution of the Series D Preferred Stock and reduction\nin the value of any Series D Preferred Stock. In addition, depending on the prices at which the ongoing monthly redemptions of Series D Preferred Stock occur, the conversion price for the Convertible\nNotes could be repeatedly adjusted downwards which would in turn cause significant pressure on the value of the Company’s Common Stock.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\n20\nAs of December 31, 2023, the outstanding Series D Preferred Stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $64.8 million, with aggregate accrued and unpaid dividends in\nthe amount of approximately $32.3 million, for a total liquidation value of $97.1 million. After September 21, 2023, each holder of Series D Preferred Stock has the right, at such holder’s option, to\nrequest that the Company redeem any or all of such holder’s shares of Series D Preferred Stock on a monthly basis.\nAs the Series D Preferred Holders’ continue to exercise their redemption rights on a monthly basis, the Company will continue to pay the aggregate redemption price in shares of our\nCommon Stock. The Company does not believe it is in its interests to liquidate assets or incur indebtedness to fund cash redemptions of the Series D Preferred Stock and, accordingly, it has no\nintention of doing so. Therefore, the Company intends to continue to settle redemptions of Series D Preferred Stock in Common Stock. We believe that the issuance of Common Stock to settle\nredemptions in Common Stock will continue to result in a substantial dilution of the outstanding Common Stock.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page 35 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents a comparison of the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands).\nFor the Years Ended December 31, Changes\n2023 2022 Dollars Percent\nRevenues $ 102,325 $ 76,645 $ 25,680 33.5 %\nProperty operating expense 34,870 25,731 9,139 35.5 %\nProperty operating income 67,455 50,914 16,541\nDepreciation and amortization (28,502) (19,540) (8,962) 45.9 %\nImpairment of assets held for sale — (760) 760 n/a\nCorporate general & administrative (11,750) (8,620) (3,130) 36.3 %\nGain on disposal of properties 2,204 2,604 (400) (15.4)%\nInterest income 484 65 419 644.6 %\nGain on investment securities, net 685 — 685 n/a\nInterest expense (32,314) (30,107) (2,207) (7.3)%\nNet changes in fair value of derivative liabilities 3,458 (2,335) 5,793 248.1 %\nGain on preferred stock redemptions 9,893 — 9,893 n/a\nOther expense (5,482) (691) (4,791) (693.3)%\nIncome tax expense (48) — (48) n/a\nNet Income (Loss) 6,083 (8,470) 14,553\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 10,770 3,984 6,786 170.3 %\nNet Loss Attributable to Wheeler REIT $ (4,687) $ (12,454) $ 7,767\nRevenues were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase in rental revenues of $25.1 million, which is primarily due to a $21.1 million increase in property revenues from the Cedar\nAcquisition, partially offset by 2022 property sales, (2) an increase of $2.8 million in market lease amortization and (3) an increase of $1.1 million in same-property revenues. See Same-Property Net\nOperating Income for further details about the changes within operating revenue.\n21\nProperty Operating expenses were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase of $7.6 million in property operating expenses from the Cedar Acquisition, partially offset by 2022 property\nsales and (2) an increase of $1.5 million in same-property expenses.\nImpairment was lower primarily as a result of the Harbor Point Land Parcel (defined below) held for sale in 2022.\nDepreciation and amortization were higher primarily as a result of the Cedar Acquisition.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses were higher primarily as a result of (1) an increase of $1.2 million in professional fees primarily a result of the Cedar Acquisition, (2) an\nincrease of $1.1 million in compensation and benefits primarily driven by hiring more employees due to the Cedar Acquisition and payroll related costs, and (3) an increase of $0.7 million in corporate\nadministration costs primarily a result of the Cedar Acquisition.\nInterest expense was higher primarily as a result of a full year of the Cedar Acquisition. Below is a comparison of the components which make up interest expense (in thousands):\nDecember 31, Changes\n2023 2022 Dollars % Change\nProperty debt interest - excluding Cedar debt $ 16,153 $ 14,717 $ 1,436 9.8 %\nConvertible Notes interest (1) 3,908 3,739 169 4.5 %\nDefeasance paid 1,758 2,614 (856) (32.7)%\nAmortization of deferred financing costs 2,860 6,098 (3,238) (53.1)%\nProperty debt interest - Cedar 7,635 2,939 4,696 159.8 %\nTotal Interest Expense $ 32,314 $ 30,107 $ 2,207 7.3 %\n(1) Includes the fair value adjustment for the paid-in-kind interest.\nNet changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities increased, which represents a non-cash adjustment from a change in the fair value that includes adjustments in valuation assumptions.\nSee Note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nGain on preferred stock redemptions is a result of the redemptions of Series D Preferred Stock. The value of the Common Stock issued to holders redeeming their Series D Preferred Stock\nis the volume weighted average price per share of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Holder Redemption Date as reported on\nNasdaq (the \"VWAP\"). During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company has realized a gain of $9.9 million in the aggregate due to the closing price of the Common Stock on the last VWAP\ndate differing from the VWAP used to calculate the shares issued in each redemption round.\nOther expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consists of capital structure transaction\ncosts. Other expenses were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which consisted of legal settlement costs.\nSame-Property Net Operating Income\nNOI is a widely-used non-GAAP financial measure for REITs. The Company believes that NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines\nNOI as property revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because NOI excludes general and administrative\nexpenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or capital expenditures and leasing costs and impairment charges, it provides\na performance measure, that when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to\noperations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses NOI to evaluate its operating\nperformance since NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and\nreturns. NOI should not be viewed as a measure of the Company's overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization,\ninvoluntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, straight-line rents, market lease amortization, gain or\n22\nloss on sale or disposition of assets, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties. Other REITs may use different\nmethodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of same-property NOI from operating income (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure). Same-property NOI consists only of those\nproperties owned during the entirety of all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands )\nOperating Income $ 29,407 $ 24,598\nAdjustments:\nGain on disposal of properties (2,204) (2,604)\nCorporate general & administrative 11,750 8,620\nImpairment of assets held for sale — 760\nDepreciation and amortization 28,502 19,540\nStraight-line rents (1,370) (800)\nAbove (below) market lease amortization, net (4,849) (2,079)\nOther non-property revenue (135) (23)\nNOI related to properties not defined as same-property (20,061) (6,607)\nSame-Property Net Operating Income $ 41,040 $ 41,405\nTotal same-property NOI was $41.0 million and $41.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing a decrease of 0.9%. Same-property NOI was\nimpacted by (1) $1.3 million increase in rental revenue driven by strong leasing activity, (2) $0.3 million increase in other revenues due to termination fees and enterprise zone credits; (3) $0.2 million\nsavings in rent expense due to the purchase of the Devine Street Land Acquisition, which terminated the Company's ground lease associated with this property, offset by a (4) $1.4 million increase in\nproperty operating expenses necessary as part of financing requirements, (5) $0.3 million demolition of an outparcel building that was placed out of service and (6) an increase in credit losses from\ntenants of $0.5 million.\nNOI related to properties not defined as same-properties for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is attributable to the Cedar Acquisition and the 2022 property sales. The Cedar\nAcquisition had property revenues of $33.2 million and $11.0 million, respectively, and property expenses of $13.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nFunds from Operations\nWe use funds from operations (\"FFO\"), a non-GAAP measure, as an alternative measure of our operating performance, specifically as it relates to results of operations and liquidity. We\ncompute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of Nareit in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999, April 2002 and December 2018). As\ndefined by Nareit, FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization\n(excluding amortization of loan origination costs), plus impairment of real estate related long-lived assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Most industry\nanalysts and equity REITs, including us, consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains or losses on dispositions and excluding\ndepreciation, FFO is a helpful tool that can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company’s real estate between periods, or as compared to different companies. Management uses\nFFO as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using GAAP net income alone as the primary measure of our operating\nperformance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, while historically real\nestate values have risen or fallen with market conditions. Accordingly, we believe FFO provides a valuable alternative measurement tool to GAAP when presenting our operating results.\n23\nWe believe the computation of FFO in accordance with Nareit's definition includes certain items that are not indicative of the results provided by our operating portfolio and affect the\ncomparability of our period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, non-cash amortization on loans and\nacquisition costs. Therefore, in addition to FFO, management uses Adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), which we define to exclude such items. Management believes that these adjustments are appropriate in\ndetermining AFFO as they are not indicative of the operating performance of our assets. In addition, we believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in\ncomparing us to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, there can be no assurance that AFFO presented by us is comparable to the adjusted or\nmodified FFO of other REITs.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO available for common shareholders and AFFO (in thousands):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet income (loss) $ 6,083 $ (8,470)\nDepreciation and amortization of real estate assets 28,502 19,540\nImpairment of assets held for sale — 760\nGain on disposal of properties (2,204) (2,604)\nFFO 32,381 9,226\nPreferred stock dividends - undeclared (9,262) (9,056)\nDividends on noncontrolling interests preferred stock (10,752) (3,913)\nPreferred stock accretion adjustments 460 584\nFFO available to common stockholders and common unitholders 12,827 (3,159)\nOther non-recurring and non-cash expenses 2,051 3,092\nGain on investment securities, net (685) —\nNet changes in fair value of derivative liabilities (3,458) 2,335\nGain on preferred stock redemptions (9,893) —\nStraight-line rental revenue, net straight-line expense (1,380) (768)\nDeferred financing cost amortization 2,860 6,098\nPaid-in-kind interest 3,908 3,739\nAbove (below) market lease amortization, net (4,849) (2,079)\nRecurring capital expenditures tenant improvement reserves (1,628) (1,354)\nAFFO $ (247) $ 7,904\nOther non-recurring and non-cash expenses are costs of the Company that we believe will not be incurred on a go-forward basis. Other non-recurring expenses of $2.1 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, were primarily a result of $1.8 million in loan defeasance payments and $0.3 million costs to demolish decommissioned space not included in the Company's gross leasable\narea. For the year ended December 31, 2022, other non-recurring expenses totaled $3.1 million, primarily including $2.6 million in loan defeasance payments a result of the 2022 loan refinancing\nactivities and $0.7 million legal settlement costs and severance, partially offset with $0.4 million nonrecurring revenue related to Cedar's recognition of easement revenue.\nInflation, Deflation and Economic Condition Considerations\nThe U.S. is experiencing elevated levels of inflation, which could continue or worsen. Substantially all of the Company’s tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the\nnegative impact of inflation in the near term. Such lease provisions include clauses that require tenants to reimburse the Company for inflation-sensitive costs such as real estate taxes, insurance and\nmany of the operating expenses it incurs. In addition, many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years, which permits us to seek increased rents upon re-rental at market rates. However,\nsignificant inflation rate increases over\n24\na prolonged period of time may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Conversely, deflation could lead to downward pressure on rents and other sources of income.\nInterest rate increases could result in higher incremental borrowing costs for the Company and our tenants. The duration of the Company's indebtedness and our relatively low exposure to\nfloating rate debt have mitigated the direct impact of inflation and interest rate increases. The degree and pace of these changes have had and may continue to have impacts on our business.\nItem 7A.

Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within\nthe time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, such disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us ino ur filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules promulgated\nunder the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes\nthose policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial\nstatements.\n25\nOur internal control over financial reporting is evaluated on a regular basis by personnel in our organization. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary, as disclosure and internal controls are intended to be dynamic systems that change (including improvements and corrections)\nas conditions warrant.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, utilizing the framework established in\n“INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Based on this assessment, management has\ndetermined that our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 were effective.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Management's report was not\nsubject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with SEC rules.\nItem 9B.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended, December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on\nour audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond\nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters\nbelow, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of Real Estate for Impairment\nDescription of Matter\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s net real estate totaled $565.1 million. As more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its real estate\ninvestments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable. Management evaluates various qualitative\nfactors in determining whether or not events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a real estate investment may not be recoverable.\nAuditing the Company’s impairment assessment involved subjectivity due to the estimation required to assess significant assumptions utilized in the recoverability of the real estate based on\nundiscounted operating income and residual values, such as assumptions related to renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on vacant spaces, and estimates of operating\ncosts.\n28\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nTo test the Company’s evaluation of net real estate for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies applied, evaluating the significant\nassumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analysis. We compared the recoverability calculated to the remaining net book value of the\nassets to ensure recoverability for the properties’ remaining useful lives. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to relevant market information and other applicable sources. As\npart of our evaluation, we performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted cash flows of the related property that would result from changes in the\nassumptions.\nDerivative Liabilities\nDescription of Matter\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had convertible notes with an outstanding principal balance of $31.5 million and 106,171 common stock warrants. Calculations and accounting for the notes\npayable and embedded conversion features as well as the warrants require management’s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition, use of a valuation model, and determination of the\nappropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. As more fully described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a multinomial lattice model valuation\ntechnique in measuring the fair value of the notes’ conversion features and the Black-Scholes valuation method in measuring the fair value of the warrants.\nAuditing management’s valuations of the derivative liabilities was challenging due to the complexity of valuation model and the inputs that are highly sensitive to changes such as the common stock\nmarket price, volatility, risk free rates, and yields.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nTo test the accounting for the derivative liabilities resulting from the issuance of warrants and convertible notes, our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the contracts, and testing\ncompleteness and accuracy of the data used as well as management’s application of the relevant accounting guidance. We also involved our valuation specialists to evaluate the Company’s\ndetermination of the fair value of the derivative liabilities, including testing the appropriateness of the methodology used and assessing the reasonableness of the underlying inputs.\n/s/ Cherry Bekaert LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nVirginia Beach, Virginia\nMarch 5, 2024\n29\nWheeler Real Estate

Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on June 23, 2011. The Trust serves as the general partner of the Operating Partnership, which was formed as a\nVirginia limited partnership on April 5, 2012. At December 31, 2023, the Company owned 99.13% of the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2023, the Trust, through the Operating\nPartnership, owned and operated seventy-five centers and four undeveloped properties. Twenty-one of these properties are located in South Carolina, twelve in Georgia, ten in Virginia, eight in\nPennsylvania, six in North Carolina, four in Massachusetts, four in New Jersey, three in Florida, three in Connecticut, two in Kentucky, two in Tennessee, one in Alabama, one in Maryland, one in\nWest Virginia, and one in Oklahoma. Accordingly, the use of the word \"Company\", \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\" refers to the Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where the context otherwise\nrequires. The Company includes the Trust, the Operating Partnership, the entities included in the REIT formation and the entities acquired since November 2012. The Company prepared the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. All material balances and transactions\nbetween the consolidated entities of the Company have been eliminated.\nThe Company owns, leases and operates income producing grocery-anchored centers, neighborhood centers, community centers and free-standing retail properties with a strategy to acquire\nhigh quality retail properties that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. The Company targets properties in communities that have stable demographics. The Company considers properties that are\ngenerally located in the most prominent shopping districts in their respective markets, ideally situated at major “Main and Main” intersections. The Company generally leases its properties to national\nand regional supermarket chains and selects retailers that offer necessity and value-oriented services and items, and generate regular consumer traffic. The Company’s tenants carry goods and offer\nservices that are less impacted by fluctuations in the broader U.S. economy and consumers’ disposable income, which it believes generates more predictable property-level cash flows.\nThe Trust through the Operating Partnership owns Wheeler Interests, LLC (\"WI\") and Wheeler Real Estate, LLC (\"WRE\") (WRE and, together with WI, the \"Operating Companies\"). The\nOperating Companies are Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (\"TRS\") to accommodate serving the Non-REIT Properties since applicable REIT regulations consider the income derived from these services to\nbe “bad” income subject to taxation. The regulations allow for costs incurred by the Company commensurate with the services performed for the Non-REIT Properties to be allocated to a TRS.\nAcquisition of Cedar Realty Trust\nOn March 2, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the \"Merger Agreement\") with Cedar, Cedar Realty Trust Partnership, L.P., (\"Cedar OP\"),\nWHLR Merger Sub Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and WHLR OP Merger Sub LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub I (\"Merger Sub II\"), pursuant to which the Company\nagreed to acquire Cedar, including 19 of its shopping center assets, in an all-cash merger transaction consisting, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, of a payment to Cedar common\nshareholders of merger consideration of $9.48 per common share.\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company completed the merger transaction with Cedar. As a result of the merger, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of the Cedar's common stock,\nwhich ceased to be publicly traded on the NYSE. Cedar’s outstanding 7.25% Series B Preferred Stock and 6.50% Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding and continue to trade on the NYSE.\nEach outstanding share of common stock of Cedar and outstanding common unit of the Cedar OP held by persons other than Cedar immediately prior to the merger were cancelled and converted into\nthe right to receive a cash payment of $9.48 per share or unit. As a result Cedar became a subsidiary of the REIT.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company incurred acquisition related costs of $5.51 million for the merger. These costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition and are\nprimarily comprised of professional fees and legal fees, see Note 3 for further details.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K include Cedar starting from the date of acquisition. We have determined that this acquisition is not a variable interest entity,\nas defined under the consolidation topic of the FASB, Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), and we evaluated such entity under the voting model and concluded we should consolidate the\nentity. Under the voting model, we consolidate the entity if we determine that we, directly or indirectly, have greater than 50% of the voting rights and that other equity holders do not have substantive\nparticipating rights.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nReal Estate Investments\nThe Company records investment properties and related intangibles at fair value upon acquisition. Investment properties include both acquired and constructed assets. Improvements and\nmajor repairs and maintenance are capitalized when the repair and maintenance substantially extends the useful life, increases capacity or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and\nmaintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company allocates the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the asset based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable\nor unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, the Company may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and any intangible assets related to out-\nof-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place leases the Company determines to exist. The Company determines fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate\ndiscount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends and specific\nmarket and economic conditions that may affect the property. Factors considered by management in the analysis of determining the as-if-vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs\nduring the expected lease-up periods considering market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance and estimates of\nlost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, tenant demand and other economic conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing\ncommissions, tenant improvements, legal and other related expenses. Intangibles related to out-of-market leases, tenant relationships and in-place lease value are recorded at fair value as acquired\nlease intangibles and are amortized as an adjustment to rental revenue or amortization expense, as appropriate, over the remaining terms of the underlying leases.\nThe Company records depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally5 to 40 years. The Company reviews\ndepreciable lives of investment properties periodically and makes adjustments to reflect a shorter economic life, when necessary. Tenant allowances, tenant inducements and tenant improvements are\namortized utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.\nAmounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. The Company amortizes amounts allocated to tenant\nimprovements, in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. The Company also estimates the value of other acquired intangible assets, if\nany, and amortizes them over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.\nThe Company reviews investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment\nproperties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in the property’s cash flows, occupancy and fair market value. The Company measures any impairment\nof investment property when the estimated undiscounted future operating income before depreciation and amortization, plus its residual value, is less than the carrying value of the property. Estimated\nundiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization include renewal and renegotiations of current leases, estimates of new leases on vacant spaces, estimates of operating costs and\nfluctuating market conditions. The renewal and renegotiations of leases in some cases must be approved by additional third parties outside the control of the Company and the tenant. If such renewed\nor renegotiated leases are approved at amounts below current estimates, then impairment adjustments may be necessary in the future. To the extent impairment has occurred, the Company charges to\nincome the excess of the carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. The Company estimates fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization\nrates, or multiples, leasing prospects for vacant spaces and local market information. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and\nrepresent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nAssets Held For Sale and Discontinued Operations\nThe Company may decide to sell properties that are held for use. The Company records these properties as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets, actively\nseeks a buyer for the assets, and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year. Properties classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of\n35\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\ntheir carrying value or their fair value, less estimated costs to sell. When the carrying value exceeds the fair value, less estimated costs to sell, an impairment expense is recognized. The Company\nestimates fair value, less estimated closing costs, based on similar real estate sales transactions. These valuation assumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement\nand represent Level 2 and 3 inputs. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active; and\ninputs other than quoted prices. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. See Note 3\nfor additional details on impairment of assets held for sale for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAssets held for sale are presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the disposition represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's\nfinancial position or results of operations. This includes the net gain (or loss) upon disposal of property held for sale, the property's operating results, depreciation and interest expense.\nConditional Asset Retirement Obligation\nA conditional asset retirement obligation represents a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement depends on a future event that\nmay or may not be within the Company’s control. Currently, the Company does not have any conditional asset retirement obligations. However, any such obligations identified in the future would\nresult in the Company recording a liability if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Environmental studies conducted at the time the Company acquired its properties did not\nreveal any material environmental liabilities, and the Company is unaware of any subsequent environmental matters that would have created a material liability. The Company believes that its\nproperties are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental, as well as non-environmental, statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company did not record any conditional asset\nretirement obligation liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of9 0 days or less to be cash and cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which\napproximates fair value. Cash equivalents consist primarily of bank operating accounts and money markets. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk\ninclude its cash and cash equivalents and its trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with institutions of high credit quality.\nRestricted cash represents amounts held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance, reserves for capital improvements, leasing costs and tenant security deposits.\nThe Company places its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash on deposit with financial institutions in the United States, which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company\n(\"FDIC\") up to $250 thousand. The Company's loss in the event of failure of these financial institutions is represented by the difference between the FDIC limit and the total amounts on deposit.\nManagement monitors the financial institutions credit worthiness in conjunction with balances on deposit to minimize risk.\nTenant Receivables\nTenant receivables include base rents, tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to recording rents on a straight-line basis. The Company determines an allowance for the\nuncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable based upon customer credit-worthiness (including expected recovery of a claim with respect to any tenants in bankruptcy), historical bad\ndebt levels, and current economic trends. The Company considers a receivable past due once it becomes delinquent per the terms of the lease. The Company’s standard lease form considers a rent\ncharge past due after five days. A past due receivable triggers certain events such as notices, fees and other allowable and required actions per the lease.\nAbove and Below Market Lease Intangibles, net\nThe Company determines the above and below market lease intangibles upon acquiring a property. Above and below market lease intangibles are amortized over the life of the respective\nleases. Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is recorded as a component of rental revenues.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nDeferred Costs and Other Assets, net\nThe Company’s deferred costs and other assets consist primarily of leasing commissions, leases in place, capitalized legal and marketing costs, tenant relationships and ground lease sandwich\ninterest intangibles associated with acquisitions. The Company’s lease origination costs consist primarily of the portion of property acquisitions allocated to lease originations and commissions paid to\nthird parties in connection with lease originations. The Company generally records amortization of lease origination costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Amortization of\ndeferred costs and other assets represents a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including stock\npurchase warrants and convertible notes, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are\naccounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The assumptions used in these fair value estimates are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nThe Company may incur debt issuance costs in connection with raising funds through debt. These costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants and convertible notes).\nThese costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed. Debt\nissuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability in the consolidated balance sheets.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nThe Series D Preferred Stock was initially classified as mezzanine equity because the redemption provisions were conditional upon the occurrence of an event that was not certain. The Series\nD Preferred Stock was valued at net proceeds plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In 2023, this event became certain and in accordance with ASC 480, the Series D Preferred Stock was revalued at the\nredemption price which includes undeclared dividends, representing liquidation value. The adjustment to liquidation value was recognized in accumulated deficit as an adjustment to redemption value.\nAdditionally, in accordance with ASC 480, as holders exercise their redemption rights the Series D Preferred Stock becomes mandatorily redeemable and the liquidation value of their exercise is\nclassified as a liability.\nOperating Partnership Purchase of Stock\nThe Operating Partnership purchased 71,343 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock on September 22, 2020 from an unaffiliated investor at $15.50 per share. The Company considers the\npurchase of the REIT's equity securities to be retired in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nLease Contract Revenue\nThe Company has two classes of underlying assets relating to rental revenue activity, retail and office space. The Company retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of\nthese underlying assets and accounts for these leases as operating leases. The Company combines lease and nonlease components in lease contracts, which includes combining base rent and tenant\nreimbursement revenue.\nThe Company accrues minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases which results in an unbilled rent asset or deferred rent liability being recorded on the\nbalance sheet. Additionally, certain lease agreements\n37\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\ncontain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants’ sales volumes (contingent or percentage rent). Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants achieve the specified targets as defined\nin their lease agreements as variable lease income.\nThe Company’s leases generally require the tenant to reimburse the Company for a substantial portion of its expenses incurred in operating, maintaining, repairing, insuring and managing the\nshopping center and common areas (collectively defined as Common Area Maintenance or “CAM” expenses). This significantly reduces the Company’s exposure to increases in costs and operating\nexpenses resulting from inflation or other outside factors. These reimbursements are considered nonlease components which the Company combines with the lease component. The Company\ncalculates the tenant’s share of operating costs by multiplying the total amount of the operating costs by the tenant's pro-rata percentage of square footage to total square footage of the property. The\nCompany also receives payments for these reimbursements from substantially all its tenants throughout the year. The Company recognizes tenant reimbursements as variable lease income.\nAdditionally, the Company has tenants who pay real estate taxes directly to the taxing authority. The Company excludes these Company costs paid directly by the tenant to third parties on\nthe Company’s behalf from both variable revenue payments recognized and the associated property operating expenses. The Company does not evaluate whether certain sales taxes and other similar\ntaxes are the Company’s costs or tenants' costs. Instead, the Company accounts for these costs as tenant costs.\nThe Company recognizes lease termination fees, which are included in \"other revenues\" on the consolidated statements of operations, in the year that the lease is terminated and collection of\nthe fee is reasonably assured. Upon early lease termination, the Company records losses related to unrecovered intangibles and other assets.\nSegment Information\nThe Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of grocery-anchored shopping centers. The Company reviews operating and financial information for each property on an\nindividual basis and, accordingly, each property represents an individual operating segment. The Company evaluates financial performance using property operating income, which consists of rental\nincome and other property income, less operating expenses and real estate taxes. The Company has no operations outside of the United States of America. Therefore, the Company has aggregated its\nproperties into one reportable segment as the properties share similar long-term economic characteristics and have other similarities including the fact that they are operated using consistent business\nstrategies, are typically located in similar markets, and have similar tenant mixes.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to\nmaintain this REIT status, the regulations require the Company to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to stockholders and meet certain other asset and income tests, as well as other\nrequirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it fails to qualify. If the Company loses its REIT status it could not elect\nto be taxed as a REIT for five years unless the Company’s failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.\nManagement has evaluated the effect of the guidance provided by generally accepted accounting principles onA ccounting for Uncertainty of Income Taxes and has determined that the\nCompany had no uncertain income tax positions.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities approximates fair market value due to their immediate or short-term maturity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements, and revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Company’s actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOther Expense\n38\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nOther expense represents expenses which are non-operating in nature. Other expenses were $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which consists of capital structure transaction\ncosts. Other expenses were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which consisted of legal settlement costs.\nLease Commitments\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases, in which the Company is the lessee, are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and\noperating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease\nROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the\nCompany uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets include\nany lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that the company will exercise that option.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company elects the practical expedient to combine lease and associated nonlease components. The lease components are the majority of its leasing arrangements and the Company\naccounts for the combined component as an operating lease. In the event the Company modifies existing ground leases or enters into new ground leases, such leases may be classified as finance leases.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests is the portion of equity in the Operating Partnership not attributable to the Trust and noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar. The ownership\ninterests not held by the parent are considered noncontrolling interests. Accordingly, noncontrolling interests have been reported in equity on the consolidated balance sheets but separate from the\nCompany’s equity. On the consolidated statements of operations, the subsidiaries are reported at the consolidated amount, including both the amount attributable to the Company and noncontrolling\ninterests. Consolidated statements of equity include beginning balances, activity for the period and ending balances for stockholders’ equity, noncontrolling interests and total equity.\nThe noncontrolling interest of the Operating Partnership common unit holders is calculated by multiplying the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage at the balance sheet date by the\nOperating Partnership’s net assets (total assets less total liabilities). The noncontrolling interest percentage is calculated at any point in time by dividing the number of units not owned by the\nCompany by the total number of units outstanding. The noncontrolling interest ownership percentage will change as additional units are issued or as units are exchanged for the Company’s $0.01 par\nvalue per share common stock (\"Common Stock\"). In accordance with GAAP, any changes in the value from period to period are charged to additional paid-in capital.\nThe noncontrolling interest attributable to the acquisition of Cedar represents the fair value of Cedar's outstanding7 .25% Series B Preferred Stock (\"Cedar Series B Preferred\") and 6.50%\nSeries C Preferred Stock (\"Cedar Series C Preferred\") as of August 22, 2022, the date of acquisition. The valuation assumption was based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value\nmeasurements and represents Level 1 inputs. Level 1 inputs represent observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The total cumulative\ndividends for the Cedar Series B Preferred and Cedar Series C Preferred were $10.8 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included as an increase to net\nloss attributable to Wheeler REIT Common Stockholders on the consolidated statements of operations.\nReclassifications\nThe Company has reclassified certain prior period amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to be consistent with the current period presentation. These\nreclassifications had no effect on net loss. All per share\n39\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n2.

The guidance will require that the\nCompany continue to disclose existing segment information required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, as well as significant segment expenses and other segment items that are\nregularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The Company will also be required to disclose the title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses reported measures of\nsegment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The guidance will be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2024 and interim\nperiods within the Company's fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2025. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the guidance, but does not believe it will have a material effect on the\nCompany's consolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been recently issued or proposed by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies are not currently applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n40\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n3.

The Devine Street Land Acquisition\nterminated the Company's ground lease associated with this property.\nAssets Held for Sale, Impairment and Dispositions\nImpairment expenses on assets held for sale are a result of reducing the carrying value for the amount that exceeded the property's fair value less estimated selling costs. The valuation\nassumptions are based on the three-level valuation hierarchy for fair value measurement and represent Level 2 inputs. No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nImpairment expense was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting from reducing the carrying value of an approximately5 acre land parcel held by Harbor Point Associates, LLC,\na wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the \"Harbor Point Land Parcel\"). The Harbor Point Land Parcel did not meet the requirements to be classified as held for sale at December 31, 2023 or\n2022.\nThe following properties were sold during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):\nDisposal Property Contract Price Gain (Loss) Net Proceeds\nJuly 11, 2023 Carll's Corner Outparcel $ 3,000 $ 2,204 $ 2,759\nDecember 9, 2022 Butler Square 9,250 2,619 8,723\nJanuary 11, 2022 Walnut Hill Plaza 1,986 (15) 1,786\nCedar Acquisition\nOn August 22, 2022, the Company acquired Cedar, a 2.9 million square foot shopping center portfolio consisting of 19 properties located primarily in the Northeast from Virginia to\nMassachusetts (the \"Cedar Portfolio\").

Investments Securities - Related Party\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company subscribed for an investment in the amount of $3.0 million for limited partnership interests in Stilwell Activist Investments, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership\n(“SAI”). On September 1, 2023, and November 30, 2023, the Company subscribed for additional investments each in the amount of $3.5 million for limited partnership interests in SAI. The\ninvestment objective of SAI is to seek long-term capital appreciation through investing primarily in publicly-traded undervalued financial institutions or businesses with a strong financial component,\nor the securities of any of them, and pursuing an activist shareholder agenda with respect to those institutions.\nStilwell Value LLC (\"Value\") is the general partner of SAI. Joseph Stilwell, a member of the Company's Board of Directors, is the managing member of Value and a limited partner in funds\nadvised by Value. Additionally, E.J. Borrack, a member of the Board of Directors, serves as the General Counsel to Value and its affiliated entities, including SAI and related funds, and is a limited\npartner in one of the funds advised by Value. Megan Parisi, a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, serves as the Director of Communications to Value and its affiliated entities, including\nSAI and related funds, is a non-managing member of Value and is a limited partner in one of the funds advised by Value.\nThe Company’s initial subscription in SAI was approved by the disinterested directors of the Company, and, after the formation of the Related Person Transactions Committee, the further\nsubscriptions in SAI were approved by that Committee.\nA portion of SAI's underlying investments are in the Company's own equity and debt securities.\nSAI records investment transactions based on trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are determined on a specific identification basis. Dividend income, net of\nwithholding taxes, and dividend expense are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income and expense are recognized on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums to the face amount of\ndebt securities are accreted and amortized using the effective interest rate method over the lives of the respective debt securities.\nThe Company may not withdraw its capital from SAI for a period of one year measured from the date of the Company's initial investment, subject to certain exceptions.\nIn consideration for management, administrative and operational services, limited partners of SAI pay a management fee to an affiliate of Value each calendar quarter, in advance, equal to\n0.25% (an annualized rate of 1%) of each limited partner’s capital account balance on the first day of such calendar quarter. In addition, as of the last day of each specified performance period, an\nincentive allocation of 20% of the amount by which the “positive performance change,” if any, that has been credited to the capital account of a limited partner during such period exceeds any positive\nbalance in such limited partner’s “carryforward account,” is debited from the limited partner’s capital account and is simultaneously credited to the capital account of Value.\nThe Company’s SAI investment is accounted for under the equity method and measured at net asset value as a practical expedient and has not been classified within the fair value hierarchy. All\ngains and losses, realized and unrealized, and fees are recorded through \"gain on investment securities, net\" on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of\nthe Company’s SAI investment was $10.7 million, which includes $10.0 million from subscriptions and $0.2 million in fees.

On September 11, 2023, the Company paid down $0.9 million of the Convertible Notes through an open market purchase of3 5,000 units totaling $1.9 million.\nAs a result of these transactions the Company recognized a $1.6 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 which represents the fair value of the purchase over principal pay down. The loss is\nincluded in \"other expense\" on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Convertible Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the holders of the Convertible Notes, into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion\nprice of $62.50 per share of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Conversion Price”); provided, however, that if at any time after September 21, 2023, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have\nrequired the Company to redeem (payable in cash or stock) in the aggregate at least 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, then the Conversion Price will be adjusted to the lower of (i)5 5% of\nthe Conversion Price or (ii) a 45% discount to the lowest price at which any Series D Preferred Stock was converted into the Common Stock.

As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate secured term loans, which were determined to\nbe Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, was $420.8 million and $429.1 million, respectively, and the carrying value of such loans, was $451.2 million and $440.2 million, respectively.\nThe fair value of the Convertible Notes was estimated using available market information. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Convertible Notes, which\nwere determined to be Level 1 within the valuation hierarchy, was $75.7 million and $40.9 million, respectively, and the carrying value, was $26.4 million and $25.8 million, respectively.\n7. Derivative Liabilities\nFair Value of Warrants\nThe Company utilized the Black-Scholes valuation method to calculate the fair value of the warrants noted below. Significant observablea nd unobservable inputs include stock price,\nconversion price, risk-free rate, term, likelihood of an event of contractual conversion and expected volatility. The Black-Scholes valuation method simulation is a Level 3 valuation technique because\nit requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators. The warrants noted below contain terms and features that give rise to derivative liability\nclassification.\nWarrants to purchase shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nWarrant Name Warrants Exercise Price Expiration Date\nPowerscourt Warrant 49,641 $31.20 12/22/2023\nWilmington Warrant Tranche A 51,020 $34.30 3/12/2026\nWilmington Warrant Tranche B 42,424 $41.25 3/12/2026\nWilmington Warrant Tranche C 12,727 $68.75 3/12/2026\nIn measuring the warrant liability, the Company used the following inputs:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nCommon Stock price $0.31 $13.96\nWeighted average contractual term to maturity 2.2 years 2.5 years\nRange of expected market volatility % 137.71% 66.00% - 72.88%\nRange of risk-free interest rate 4.23% 4.14% - 4.68%\nFair Value of Conversion Features Related to Convertible Notes\nThe Company identified certain embedded derivatives related to the conversion features of the Convertible Notes. In accordance with ASC 815-40,D erivatives and Hedging Activities, the\nembedded conversion options contained within the Convertible Notes were accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through each reporting date.\nThe Company utilized a binomial lattice model to calculate the fair value of the embedded derivatives.\n48\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n7.

The binomial lattice model is\na Level 3 valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition to observable market indicators.\nIn measuring the embedded derivative liability, the Company used the following inputs:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nConversion price $0.16 (1) $62.50\nCommon Stock price $0.31 $13.96\nContractual term to maturity 8.0 years 9.0 years\nExpected market volatility % 100.00% 205.00%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.90% 3.87%\nTraded WHLRL price % of par 240.00% 120.50%\n(1) Represents the volume weighted average of the Company's closing Common Stock price for the 10 trading days\npreceding the valuation date of December 31, 2023, less a discount of4 5%.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in fair value of the Company's derivative liabilities, which include both the warrant and embedded derivative liabilities (in\nthousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Year Ended December 31, 2022\nBalance at the beginning of period $ 7,111 $ 4,776\nChanges in fair value - Warrants (495) (753)\nChanges in fair value - Convertible Notes (2,963) 3,088\nBalance at ending of period $ 3,653 $ 7,111\n49\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLease Commitments\nThe Company is the lessee under several ground leases and for its corporate headquarters; all are accounted for as operating leases. Most leases includeo ne or more options to renew, with\nrenewal terms that can extend the lease term from 5 to 50 years. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term of our leases was3 6 and 34 years, respectively. Rent\nexpense under the operating lease agreements were $1.1 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of the Company’s undiscounted future minimum lease payments for its ground lease and corporate headquarters lease agreements applicable to\nlease liabilities as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2024 $ 815\n2025 819\n2026 823\n2027 827\n2028 829\nThereafter 19,591\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 23,704\nFuture minimum lease payments, discount (13,375)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 10,329\nInsurance\nThe Company carries comprehensive liability, property, fire, flood, wind, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in its portfolio\nunder an insurance policy, in addition to other coverages, such as trademark and pollution coverage, that may be appropriate for certain of its properties. Additionally, the Company carries a directors’,\nofficers’, entity and employment practices liability insurance policy that covers such claims made against the Company and its directors and officers. The Company believes the policy specifications\nand insured limits are appropriate and adequate for its properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to\nfully cover losses.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company is subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate. These risks include, among others, the risks normally associated with changes in the\ngeneral economic climate, trends in the retail industry, creditworthiness of tenants, competition for tenants and customers, changes in tax laws, interest rates, the availability of financing and potential\nliability under environmental and other laws.\nThe Company’s portfolio of properties is dependent upon regional and local economic conditions and is geographically located in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Northeast, which markets\nrepresented approximately 45%, 40% and 15%, respectively, of the total annualized base rent of the properties in its portfolio as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s geographic concentration may\ncause it to be more susceptible to adverse developments in those markets than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio. Additionally, the Company’s retail shopping center properties\ndepend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of, or a store closure by, one or more of these tenants.\nRegulatory and Environmental\nAs the owner of the buildings on our properties, the Company could face liability for the presence of hazardous materials (e.g., asbestos or lead) or other adverse conditions (e.g., poor indoor\nair quality) in its buildings. Environmental laws\n50\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n8. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)\ngovern the presence, maintenance, and removal of hazardous materials in buildings, and if the Company does not comply with such laws, it could face fines for such noncompliance. Also, the\nCompany could be liable to third parties (e.g., occupants of the buildings) for damages related to exposure to hazardous materials or adverse conditions in its buildings, and the Company could incur\nmaterial expenses with respect to abatement or remediation of hazardous materials or other adverse conditions in its buildings. In addition, some of the Company’s tenants routinely handle and use\nhazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject\nthe Company or its tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to the Company, and changes in laws could\nincrease the potential liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations. The Company\nis not aware of any material contingent liabilities, regulatory matters or environmental matters that may exist.\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, including, but not limited to commercial disputes. The Company believes that such litigation,\nclaims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or its results of operations. The Company records a liability when it considers the loss probable\nand the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the below legal proceedings are in process:\nOn April 8, 2022, several purported holders of Cedar’s outstanding preferred stock filed a putative class action complaint against Cedar, Cedar's of Directors prior to the Merger, and WHLR in\nMontgomery County Circuit Court, Maryland entitled Sydney, et al. v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., (Case No. C-15-CV-22-001527).\nOn May 6, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Sydney filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Also on May, 6, 2022, a purported holder of Cedar’s outstanding preferred stock filed a separate putative\nclass action complaint against Cedar and Cedar's Board of Directors prior to the Cedar Acquisition in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, entitled Kim v. Cedar Realty\nTrust, Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 22-cv-01103. On May 11, 2022, Cedar, former Board of Directors of Cedar and the Company removed theS ydney action to the United States District Court\nfor the District of Maryland, Case No. 8:22-cv-01142-GLR. On May 16, 2022, the court ordered that a hearing on the Sydney Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction be held on June 22,\n2022. On June 2, 2022, the Plaintiffs in Kim also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. The court consolidated the motions for preliminary injunction.\nOn June 23, 2022, following a hearing, the court issued an order denying both motions for preliminary injunction, holding that the Plaintiffs in both cases were unlikely to succeed on the merits\nand that Plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was denied.\nBy order dated July 11, 2022, the court consolidated the Sydney and Kim cases and set an August 24, 2022 deadline for the Plaintiffs in both cases to file a consolidated amended complaint.\nPlaintiffs filed their amended complaint on August 24, 2022. The amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of Cedar's preferred stock, among other things, claims for\nbreach of contract against Cedar and Cedar's former Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary governing the terms of Cedar's preferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty\nagainst Cedar's former Board of Directors, and tortious interference and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against the Company. On October 7, 2022, Defendants moved to dismiss\nthe amended complaint. Plaintiffs opposed the motion to dismiss and filed a motion to certify a question of law to Maryland’s Supreme Court. On August 1, 2023, the court issued a decision\nand order granting Defendants’ motions to dismiss, without leave to amend, and denying Plaintiffs’ motion to certify a question of law to the Maryland Supreme Court. The Plaintiffs appealed\nthe dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Case No. 23-1905, docketed on August 30, 2023. The Court has set a briefing schedule. The appeal has been fully\nbriefed. At this juncture, the outcome of the litigation remains uncertain.\nOn July 11, 2022, a purported holder of Cedar's outstanding preferred stock filed a complaint against Cedar and Cedar's Board of Directors prior to the Merger in the United States District\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York, entitled High Income Securities Fund v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al.,N o. 2:22-cv-4031. The complaint alleged that the Defendants violated\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by making false and misleading statements and omissions, and that Cedar's former Board of Directors are\ncontrol persons under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On September 25, 2023, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, and the time within which the\nPlaintiff could have appealed such decision has passed.\n51\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n8. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)\nOn October 14, 2022, a purported holder of the Company's outstanding preferred stock filed a putative class action against Cedar, Cedar's Board of Directors prior to the Merger, and WHLR in\nNassau County Supreme Court, New York entitled Krasner v. Cedar Realty Trust, Inc., et al., Case No. 613985/2022. The complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of holders of Cedar's\npreferred stock, among other things, claims for breach of contract against Cedar and Cedar's Board of Directors with respect to the articles supplementary governing the terms of Cedar's\npreferred stock, breach of fiduciary duty against Cedar's former Board of Directors, and tortious interference and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against WHLR. The complaint\nseeks, among other relief, an award of monetary damages, attorneys' fees, and expert fees. The Defendants filed motions in the Nassau County action to dismiss or stay the case based both on\nthe pendency of the lawsuit in Maryland in which the same claims were asserted by other preferred stockholders and on the merits. The court held a hearing on the motions on October 27, 2023,\nand on December 4, 2023 granted the motions to dismiss based on the pendency of the lawsuit in Maryland without addressing the merits.\nHarbor Point Tax Increment Financing\nOn September 1, 2011, the Grove Economic Development Authority issued the Grove Economic Development Authority Tax Increment Revenue Note, Taxable Series 2011 in the amount of\n$2.42 million, bearing a variable interest rate of 2.29%, not to exceed 14% and payable in 50 semi-annual installments. The proceeds of the bonds were to provide funding for the construction of public\ninfrastructure and other site improvements and to be repaid by incremental additional property taxes generated by development. Harbor Point, then owned by an affiliate of former CEO, Jon Wheeler,\nentered into an Economic Development Agreement with the Grove Economic Development Authority for this infrastructure development and in the event the ad valorem taxes were insufficient to\ncover annual debt service, Harbor Point would reimburse the Grove Economic Development Authority (the “Harbor Point Agreement”). In 2014, Harbor Point was acquired by the Company.\nThe total debt service shortfall over the life of the bond is uncertain as it is based on ad valorem taxes, assessed property values, property tax rates, LIBOR and future potential development\nranging until 2036. The Company’s future total principal obligation under the Harbor Point Agreement will be no more than $2.0 million, the principal amount of the bonds, as of December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, the Company may have an interest obligation on the note based on the principal balance and LIBOR rates in effect at future payment dates. The Company funded approximately $41\nthousand and $42 thousand, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in debt service shortfalls. As of December 31, 2023, 7$8 thousand was accrued for the December 2023\ndebt service payment shortfall. Future debt service shortfalls cannot be determined based on the variables noted above, as such have not been accrued.\n9.

The Reverse Stock Split took effect as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on August\n17, 2023 (the “Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, every ten issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock were converted into one share of Common Stock, and as a result, the number of\noutstanding shares of Common Stock was reduced from approximately 9,809,195 to approximately 980,919. The par value of each share of Common Stock remained unchanged. No fractional shares\nwere issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would have otherwise been issued a fractional share of the Company’s Common Stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split\ninstead received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional share in an amount equal to the applicable fraction multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the Nasdaq on August\n17, 2023 (as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split), without any interest.

The Series B Preferred has no redemption rights. However, the Series B Preferred is\nsubject to a mandatory conversion once the 20-trading day volume-weighted average closing price of our Common Stock, exceeds $580 per share; once this weighted average closing price is met,\neach share of our Series B Preferred will automatically convert into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price equal to $400.00 per share of Common Stock. In addition, holders of our Series\nB Preferred also have the option, at any time, to convert shares of our Series B Preferred into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $400.00 per share of Common Stock. Upon any\nvoluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, the holders of shares of our Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of our assets a liquidation preference of\n$25.00 per share.

Commencing September 21, 2023, the holders were entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of the Initial Rate increased by 2% of the liquidation\npreference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter, subject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15th, April 15th,\nJuly 15th and October 15th of each year.\nDividends on the Series D Preferred Stock cumulate from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends have been paid. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock cumulate\nwhether or not (i) we have earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and (iii) such dividends are authorized by our Board of Directors or declared by us.\nDividends on the Series D Preferred Stock do not bear interest. If the Company fails to pay any dividend within three (3) business days after the payment date for such dividend, the then-current\ndividend rate increases following the payment date by an additional 2.0% of the $25.00 stated liquidation preference per share until we pay the dividend, subject to our ability to cure the failure. On\nDecember 20, 2018, the Company suspended the Series D Preferred dividend.

The Series D Preferred Directors may serve on our Board of Directors, until all unpaid dividends on such Series D\nPreferred Stock and Parity Preferred Stock, if any, have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock requires the Company maintain asset coverage of at least2 00%. If we fail to maintain asset coverage of at least2 00% calculated by determining the percentage\nvalue of (i) our total assets plus accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization minus our total liabilities and indebtedness as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with\nGAAP (exclusive of the book value of any Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock (defined below)) over (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid\ndividends, of outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred Stock and any outstanding shares of term preferred stock or preferred stock providing for a fixed mandatory redemption date or maturity\ndate (collectively referred to as “Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock”) on the last business day of any calendar quarter (“Asset Coverage Ratio”), and such failure is not cured by the close of\nbusiness on the date that is 30 calendar days following the filing date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for that quarter, or the “Asset Coverage\nCure Date,” then we will be required to redeem, within 90 calendar days of the Asset Coverage Cure Date, shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock, which may include Series D Preferred\nStock, at least equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that will result in us having a coverage ratio of at least 200% and (ii) the maximum\nnumber of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that can be redeemed solely out of funds legally available for such redemption. In connection with any redemption for failure to maintain\nthe Asset Coverage Ratio, we may, in our sole option, redeem any shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock we select, including on a non-pro rata basis. We may elect not to redeem any Series\nD Preferred Stock to cure such failure as long as we cure our failure to meet the Asset Coverage Ratio by or on the Asset Coverage Cure Date. If shares of Series D Preferred Stock are to be redeemed\nfor failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, such shares will be redeemed solely in cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends,\nif any, on such shares (whether or not declared) to and including the redemption date.\nOn or after September 21, 2021, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued\nand unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date.

After September 21, 2023, each holder of the Series D Preferred Stock may, at their option, request that the Company redeem any or all of\ntheir shares on a monthly basis at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the Holder Redemption Date, payable in\ncash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the Company's option. Redemptions commenced on September 22, 2023, and the first Holder Redemption Date was October 5,\n2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company processed 175 redemption requests, collectively redeeming 864,070 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the Company\nissued 52,788,687 shares of Common Stock in settlement of an aggregate Redemption Price of approximately $32.7 million.\nThe value of the Common Stock issued to holders redeeming their Series D Preferred Stock is the volume weighted average price per share of our Common Stock for the ten consecutive\ntrading days immediately preceding, but not including, the Holder Redemption Date as reported on Nasdaq (the \"VWAP\"). As of December 31, 2023, the Company has realized a gain of $9.9 million\nin the aggregate due to the closing price of the Common Stock on the last VWAP date differing from the VWAP used to calculate the shares issued in each redemption round.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had received requests to redeem 9,843 shares of Series D Preferred Stock with\nrespect to the January 2024 Holder Redemption Date. As such, the redemption of these Series D Preferred Stock is considered certain at December 31, 2023 and the liquidation value associated with\nthese shares of $0.4 million is presented as a liability.\nThe changes in the carrying value of the Series D Preferred Stock for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\n55\nTable of Contents\nWheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n10.

(“WHLR”, the “Company” or “our”) had five classes of securities: our common stock, par value\n$0.01 per share (“Common Stock”), Series A Preferred Stock, no par value per share (“Series A Preferred”); Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share\n(“Series B Preferred”); Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value per share (“Series D Preferred” or \"Series D Preferred Stock\") and 7.00% Subordinated\nConvertible Notes due 2031 (the “Notes”). Series A Preferred, Series B Preferred and Series D Preferred are collectively referred to “Preferred Stock” hereinafter. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had authority to issue 215,000,000 shares of stock consisting of the following:\n• 200,000,000 Common Stock authorized, 53,769,787 of which were issued and outstanding;\n• 4,500 Series A Preferred authorized, 562 of which were issued and outstanding;\n• 5,000,000 Series B Preferred authorized, 3,379,142 of which were issued and outstanding; and\n• 6,000,000 Series D Preferred authorized, 2,590,458 of which were issued and outstanding.\nOur Common Stock, Series B Preferred, Series D Preferred, and the Notes are registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n“Act”) on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange. The following is a summary of each class of our securities registered under the Act and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety\nby reference to the provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Charter”), Supplementary Articles, as amended and restated and our by-laws, as\namended and restated (the “By-Laws”), copies of which are incorporated by reference within the Exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023 of which this Exhibit 4.4 is a part. Our Series A Preferred stock is not registered on an exchange for trading and is not included in the following description.\nCommon Stock\nPursuant to Article V of our Charter, each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote. The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) may\nreclassify any unissued shares of Common Stock from time to time in one or more classes or series of stock.\nWith respect to dividend payments and distribution of the Company’s assets upon redemption and upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding\nup of the Company, the holders of shares of our Common Stock are subject to the prior rights of the holders of any shares of our Preferred Stock.\nWhen and if declared by the Board, the holders of shares of Common Stock are subject to prior rights of the holders of any shares of our Preferred Stock for any\ndividends declared, paid upon or set aside for the Common Stock in any such year, dividends in cash, stock or otherwise. Any dividends on our Series D Preferred declared, but\nnot paid shall be cumulative. No deposit, payment, dividend or distribution of any kind shall be made with respect to the Common Stock unless all dividends payable on the\nPreferred Stock have been paid.\nPreferred Stock\nIn the event of (i) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, winding up or dissolution of the Company or (ii) any sale or transfer by the Company of all or substantially all\nof its assets, the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, prior to and in preference of any distribution or payment upon the Common Stock, an amount per share\nof Preferred Stock equal to the sum of the Preferred Stock purchase price plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon. To the extent the assets and funds available for\ndistribution after payment of all required obligations of the Company are insufficient to make such payment, then the entire assets and funds available for distribution shall be\ndistributed ratably among the holders of the Preferred Stock. Any amounts remaining after payment in full of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be distributed ratably\namong the holders of the Common Stock.\nSeries B Preferred\nHolders of Series B Preferred shares have the right to receive, only when and as authorized by the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, out of funds\nlegally available for the payment of dividends, cash dividends, at a rate of 9% per annum of the $25 liquidation preference per share. The Series B Preferred has no redemption\nrights. However, the Series B Preferred is subject to a mandatory conversion once the 20-trading day volume-weighted average closing price of our Common Stock, $0.01 par\nvalue per share, exceeds $580 per share; once this weighted average closing price is met, each share of our Series B Preferred will automatically convert into shares of our\nCommon Stock at a conversion price equal to $400.00 per share. In addition, holders of our Series B Preferred also have the option, at any time, to convert shares of our Series\nB Preferred into shares of our Common Stock at a conversion price of $400.00 per share of Common Stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of our company, the holders of shares of our Series B Preferred shall be entitled to be paid out of our assets a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The Series\nPreferred B has no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless subject to a mandatory or voluntary conversion as described above. Holders of Series B\nPreferred Stock have no voting rights except as provided by law.\nSeries D Preferred\nThe Series D Preferred has a $25.00 liquidation preference per share. Until September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred were entitled to receive cumulative\ncash dividends at a rate of 8.75% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share (the “Initial Rate”). Commencing September 21, 2023, the holders were entitled to\ncumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of the Initial Rate increased by 2% of the liquidation preference per annum on each subsequent anniversary thereafter,\nsubject to a maximum annual dividend rate of 14%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on or before January 15th, April 15th, July 15th and October 15th of each year. On\nor after September 21, 2021, the Company, may at its option, redeem the Series D Preferred, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all\naccrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and including the redemption date. The holder of the Series D Preferred may convert shares at any time into shares of the Company’s\nCommon Stock at an initial conversion rate of $169.60 per share of Common Stock. On September 21, 2023, the holders of the Series D Preferred may, at their option, elect to\ncause the Company to redeem any or all of their shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to and\nincluding the redemption date, payable in cash or in shares of Common Stock, or any combination thereof, at the holder’s option.\nThe Series D Preferred requires the Company maintain asset coverage of at least 200%. If we fail to maintain asset coverage of at least 200% calculated by determining\nthe percentage value of (i) our total assets plus accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization minus our total liabilities and indebtedness as reported in our financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) (exclusive of the book value of any Redeemable and Term\nPreferred Stock (defined below)) over (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends, of outstanding shares of our Series D\nPreferred Stock and any outstanding shares of term preferred stock or preferred stock providing for a fixed mandatory redemption date or maturity date (collectively referred to\nas “Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock”) on the last business day of any calendar quarter (“Asset Coverage Ratio”), and such failure is not cured by the close of business on\nthe date that is 30 calendar days following the filing date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, for that quarter, or the “Asset\nCoverage Cure Date,” then we will be required to redeem, within 90 calendar days of the Asset Coverage Cure Date, shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock, which\nmay include Series D Preferred Stock, at least equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that will result in us having a\ncoverage ratio of at least 200% and (ii) the maximum number of shares of Redeemable and Term Preferred Stock that can be redeemed solely out of funds legally available for\nsuch redemption. In connection with any redemption for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio, we may, in our sole option, redeem any shares of Redeemable and Term\nPreferred Stock we select, including on a non-pro rata basis. We may elect not to redeem any Series D Preferred Stock to cure such failure as long as we cure our failure to meet\nthe Asset Coverage Ratio by or on the Asset Coverage Cure Date. If shares of Series D Preferred Stock are to be redeemed for failure to maintain the Asset Coverage Ratio,\nsuch shares\nwill be redeemed solely in cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on such shares (whether or not\ndeclared) to and including the redemption date.\nDividends on the Series D Preferred cumulate from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends have been paid. Dividends on the Series D Preferred\ncumulate whether or not (i) we have earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and (iii) such dividends are authorized by the Board or\ndeclared by us. Dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock do not bear interest. If the Company, fails to pay any dividend within three (3) business days after the payment date\nfor such dividend, the then-current dividend rate increases following the payment date by an additional 2.0% of the $25.00 stated liquidation preference per share until we pay\nthe dividend, subject to our ability to cure the failure. On December 20, 2018, the Company suspended the Series D Preferred dividend. As such, the Series D Preferred shares\nbegan accumulating dividends at 10.75% beginning January 1, 2019 and will continue to accumulate dividends at this rate until all accumulated dividends have been paid.\nCommencing September 21, 2023, the Series D Preferred Stock holders were entitled to cumulative cash dividends at an annual dividend rate of 12.75%, subject to a maximum\nannual dividend rate of 16%, including the 2% default rate.\nHolders of shares of the Series D Preferred have no voting rights. However, if dividends on the Series D Preferred are in arrears for six or more consecutive quarterly\nperiods, the number of directors on the Board will automatically be increased by two, and holders of shares of the Series D Preferred and the holders of shares of Parity\nPreferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting together as a single class) will be entitled to vote, at a special meeting called upon\nthe written request of the holders of at least 20% of such stock or at our next annual meeting and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, for the election of two\nadditional directors to serve on the Board, until all unpaid dividends on such Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock, if any, have been paid or declared and a sum\nsufficient for the payment thereof set apart for payment. The Series D Preferred Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election. The Board of Directors is\nnot permitted to fill the vacancies on the Board of Directors as a result of the failure of the holders of 20% of the Series D Preferred and Parity Preferred Stock to deliver such\nwritten request for the election of the Series D Preferred Directors. In addition, holders of shares of the Series D Preferred shall have the right to vote to approve any\namendment to the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock. Any such amendment of the terms of the Series D Preferred Stock requires the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the\nshares of Series D Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.\n7.00% Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2031\nThis section includes a description of the material terms of the Notes and the indenture, dated as of August 13, 2021, among the Company, as Issuer, and Wilmington\nSavings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee (the “Indenture”). Because this section is a summary, however, it does not describe every aspect of the Notes and the Indenture. The\nIndenture, and not this Exhibit, defines a holder’s rights as a holder of the Notes. The Indenture has been incorporated by reference as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 of which this Exhibit 4.4 is a part. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Indenture.\nGeneral\nOn August 13, 2021, we issued $30,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes under the Indenture and on October 12, 2021 and an additional $3,000,000 in\naggregate principal amount of the Notes were issued pursuant to an exemption under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have listed the Notes on\nNasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol “WHLRL”. The Notes were issued under the Indenture.\nThe stated maturity of the Notes is December 31, 2031. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 31 of each year starting on December 31, 2021\nto holders of record at the close of business on the preceding June 1 and December 1, respectively. Interest will accrue on the Notes at a rate of 7.0% per annum. Interest will\naccrue on the Notes from and including the issuance date or from, and including, the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for, as the case may be, to,\nbut excluding, the next interest payment date or the maturity date, as the case may be. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of\ntwelve 30-day months, until the principal thereof is paid or duly provided for. Interest on any overdue principal, interest (to the extent lawful) or premium, if any, shall be\npayable on demand in the form as provided in Article Fourteen the Indenture. We issued the Notes in denominations of $25. The holders of the Notes will not have the option to\nhave the Notes repaid prior to the stated maturity date.\nCovenants\nThe Indenture contains standard covenants relating to, among other things, payment of principal and interest, maintaining an office where payments may be made or\nsecurities can be surrendered for payment and related matters, holding money for note payments in trust, maintenance of existence, maintenance of properties, payment of taxes,\ncompliance with laws, notices to the trustee regarding certain matters and delivery of certain reports to the holders.\nTrustee\nThe Trustee for the Notes is Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, and we have initially appointed the Trustee as the paying agent, conversion agent and registrar with regard\nto the Notes. Except during the continuance of an event of default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture.\nThe Trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers at the request or demand of the holders of the Notes, unless the holders of the Notes have offered to the\nTrustee security or indemnity that is satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities that the Trustee may incur to comply with the request or demand.\nSubject to applicable law and the Trustee’s rights to indemnification, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to\ndirect the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.\nOptional Redemption\nAfter January 1, 2024, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or from time to time in part, at the Company’s option at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal\namount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date (the “Redemption Price”). The Redemption Price may be paid: (a) in cash; (b) in shares of Common\nStock; or (c) in any combination of (a) and (b). For purposes of determining the value of Common Stock paid as all or part of the Redemption Price, each share of Common\nStock shall be deemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for the Common Stock for the 15 consecutive\ntrading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the relevant redemption date and (y) 0.55.\nConversion and Exchange\nUpon a change of control, each Note will mandatorily convert into shares of the Common Stock equal to: (i) the principal amount of each Note divided by (ii) the product of (x)\nthe average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the third business day immediately preceding the\ndate of such change of control, and (y) 0.55. On the maturity date, in lieu of paying the principal of the Note in cash, the Company may elect to pay such principal: (a) in cash;\n(b) in shares of Common Stock; or (c) in any combination of (a) or (b). To the extent principal is paid in shares of Common Stock each share of Common Stock shall be\ndeemed to have a value equal to the product of (x) the average of the per share volume-weighted average prices for Common Stock for the 15 consecutive trading days ending\non the third business day preceding the maturity date and (y) 0.55.\nThe Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at any time, at the option of the holders of the Notes, into shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $6.25 per share of\nCommon Stock (the “Conversion Price”); provided, however, that if at any time after September 21, 2023, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock have required the Company\nto redeem (payable in cash or stock) in the aggregate at least 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock, then the Conversion Price will be adjusted to the lower of (i) 55% of\nthe Conversion Price or (ii) a 45% discount to the lowest price at which any Series D Preferred Stock was converted into Common Stock.\nAdjustment to Conversion Price of Convertible Notes\nBecause at least 100,000 shares of the Series D Preferred Stock have been redeemed, pursuant to Section 14.02 (Optional Conversion) of the indenture governing the\nCompany’s Convertible Notes (the \"Convertible Notes Indenture\"), effective October 5, 2023, the conversion price for the Convertible Notes was adjusted to $1.59 per share of\nthe Company’s Common Stock, (15.72 shares of Common Stock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted).\nFor the February 2024 redemptions, the lowest price at which any Series D Preferred Stock was converted by a holder into Common Stock was approximately $0.22.\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 14.02 (Optional Conversion) of the indenture governing the Notes, the Conversion Price for the Notes was further adjusted to\napproximately $0.12 per share of Common Stock (approximately 209.84 shares of Common Stock for each $25.00 of principal amount of the Notes being converted),\nrepresenting a 45% discount to $0.22.\nRanking\nThe Notes are subordinate and junior in right of payment to the Company’s obligations to the holders of senior indebtedness, and that in the case of any insolvency,\nreceivership, conservatorship, reorganization, readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings or any liquidation or winding-up of or relating to\nthe Company as a whole, whether voluntary or involuntary, all obligations to holders of senior indebtedness shall be entitled to be paid in full before any payment shall be made\non account of the principal or interest on the Notes.\nEvents of Default\nThe Indenture provides that an Event of Default means that one or more of the following events has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Notes:\na. failure to pay the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note;\nb. failure to pay an installment of interest on any Note when due, if the failure continues for 30 days after the date when due;\nc. failure to timely provide notice with respect to any conversion or redemption of the Notes or failure to timely provide shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the\nNotes\nd. failure to comply with any other term, covenant or agreement contained in the Notes or the Indenture, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after notice to the\nCompany by the Trustee or to the Trustee and the Company by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Notes then outstanding, in\naccordance with the Indenture;\ne. voluntary insolvency of the Company or any of its material subsidiaries;\nf. involuntary insolvency of the Company or any of its material subsidiaries if unstayed for at least 60 days.\nIf an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing with respect to the Notes, except for the events of default relating to bankruptcy proceedings, either the Trustee, by notice to\nthe Company, or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal of,\n(and premium, if any) accrued and unpaid interest on, all the then outstanding Notes to be immediately due and payable in cash.\nModification and Waiver\nWith the written consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes delivered to the Company and the Trustee , the Company\nand the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Notes for the purpose of adding any provisions hereto or thereto, changing in any\nmanner or eliminating any of the provisions thereunder or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders thereunder and any existing Default or Event of Default or\ncompliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the\noutstanding Notes, other than Notes beneficially owned by the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that no such amendment, supplement or waiver shall, without the\nconsent of the holder of each outstanding Note affected thereby (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting holder):\na. change the stated maturity of the principal of, or the payment date of any installment of interest on, or any additional amounts with respect to, any Note;\nb. reduce the principal amount of, or any premium or interest on, any Note;\nc. change the manner, consideration or currency of payment of principal of, or any premium or interest on, any Note;\nd. impair the right to institute a suit for the enforcement of any payment on, or with respect to, or of the conversion of, any Note;\ne. modify, in a manner adverse to the holders, the provisions of the Indenture relating to the Redemption Price or the Company’s obligation to pay the Redemption Price\nwhen due;\nf. modify the ranking provisions of the Indenture, relative to other indebtedness of the Company in a manner adverse to the holders;\ng. reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes whose holders must consent to a modification or amendment of the Indenture or the Notes;\nh. reduce the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Notes whose holders must consent to a waiver of compliance with any provision of the Indenture or\nthe Notes or a waiver of any Default or Event of Default; or\ni. modify the provisions of the Indenture with respect to modification and waiver (including waiver of a Default or Event of Default), except to increase the percentage\nrequired for modification or waiver or to provide for the consent of each affected holder.\nExhibit 21.1\nSUBSIDIARIES OF THE REGISTRANT\nWheeler Interests, LLC,\nWheeler Real Estate, LLC\nBrook Run Associates, LLC\nChesapeake Square Associates, LLC\nDF I - Courtland, LLC\nHarbor Point Associates, LLC\nLaGrange Associates, LLC\nLumber River Associates, LLC\nNorthpointe Investors, LLC\nPCSC Associates, LLC\nRiversedge Office Associates, LLC\nTuckernuck Associates, LLC\nWD III Associates, LLC\nWHLR - Alex City Marketplace, LLC\nWHLR - Beaver Ruin Village II, LLC\nWHLR - Beaver Ruin Village, LLC\nWHLR - Brook Run Property, LLC\nWHLR - Bryan Station LLC\nWHLR - Butler Square, LLC\nWHLR - Cardinal Plaza, LLC\nWHLR - Carolina Place, LLC\nWHLR - Clover LLC\nWHLR - Conyers Crossing, LLC\nWHLR - Crockett Square, LLC\nWHLR - Cypress LLC\nWHLR - Darien, LLC\nWHLR - Devine Street, LLC\nWHLR - Folly Road Crossing, LLC\nWHLR - Ft.

Administration\nExcept as specifically set forth herein, this Policy shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the “Administrator”) of the Board of Directors (the “Board”).\nThe Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy. Any\ndeterminations made by the Administrator shall be final and binding on all affected individuals and need not be uniform with respect to each individual covered by the Policy.\nIn the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate as to\nmatters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority.\nSubject to any limitation at applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.

Incentive-Based Compensation is “received” for purposes of this Policy in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial\nReporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation award is attained, even if the payment or grant of such Incentive-Based Compensation\noccurs after the end of that period.\n3. Covered Executives; Incentive-Based Compensation\nThis Policy applies to Incentive-Based Compensation received by a Covered Executive (a) after beginning services as a Covered Executive; (b) if that person served as a\nCovered Executive at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; and (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national\nsecurities exchange.\n4. Required Recoupment of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in the Event of an Accounting Restatement\nIn the event the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall promptly recoup the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nreceived by any Covered Executive, as calculated pursuant to Section 5 hereof, during the Applicable Period.\n5. Erroneously Awarded Compensation: Amount Subject to Recovery\nThe amount of “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” subject to recovery under the Policy, as determined by the Administrator, is the amount of Incentive-Based\nCompensation received by the Covered Executive that exceeds the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation that would have been received by the Covered Executive had it\nbeen determined based on the restated amounts.\nErroneously Awarded Compensation shall be computed by the Administrator without regard to any taxes paid by the Covered Executive in respect of the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation.\nBy way of example, with respect to any compensation plans or programs that take into account Incentive-Based Compensation, the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation subject to recovery hereunder includes, but is not limited to, the amount contributed to any notional account based on Erroneously Awarded Compensation and\nany earnings accrued to date on that notional amount.\nFor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or TSR: (a) the Administrator shall determine the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or TSR upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was received; and (b) the Company\nshall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to NASDAQ.\n2\n6. Method of Recoupment\nThe Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation hereunder, which may include,\nwithout limitation, (a) seeking reimbursement of all or part of any cash or equity-based award, (b) cancelling prior cash or equity-based awards, whether vested or unvested, or\npaid or unpaid, (c) cancelling or offsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards, (d) forfeiture of deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Section\n409A of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and (e) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract. Subject to compliance with\nany applicable law, the Administrator may effect recovery under this Policy by setting off against any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive, including amounts\npayable to such individual under any otherwise applicable Company plan or program, including base salary, bonuses or commissions and compensation previously deferred by\nthe Covered Executive.\nThe Administrator shall determine the repayment schedule for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Such determination shall be consistent with any applicable legal\nguidance, by the SEC, judicial opinion or otherwise.\nThe Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recoup Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Administrator has\ndetermined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements:\n• The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on expense of enforcement, the Administrator must make a reasonable\nattempt to recover such erroneously awarded compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover and provide that documentation to NASDAQ; or\n• Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to\nmeet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n7. No Indemnification of Covered Executives\nNotwithstanding the terms of any indemnification or insurance policy or any contractual arrangement with any Covered Executive that may be interpreted to the contrary, the\nCompany shall not indemnify any Covered Executives against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of\nthird-party insurance purchased by any Covered Executives to fund potential clawback obligations under this Policy.\n8. Administrator Indemnification\nAny members of the Administrator, and any other members of the Board who assist in the administration of this Policy, shall not be personally liable for any action,\ndetermination or interpretation made with respect to this Policy and shall be fully indemnified by the Company to the fullest extent under applicable law and Company policy\nwith respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. The foregoing sentence shall not limit any other rights to indemnification of the members of the Board under\napplicable law or Company policy.\n9. Effective Date; Retroactive Application\nThis Policy shall be effective as of October 2, 2023 (the “Effective Date”). The terms of this Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation that is received by\nCovered Executives on or after the Effective Date, even if such Incentive-Based Compensation was approved, awarded, granted or paid to Covered Executives prior to the\nEffective Date. Without limiting the generality of Section 6 hereof, and subject to applicable law, the Administrator may effect recovery under this Policy from any amount of\ncompensation approved, awarded, granted, payable or paid to the Covered Executive prior to, on or after the Effective Date.\n10. Amendment; Termination\nThe Board may amend, modify, supplement, rescind or replace all or any portion of this Policy at any time and from time to time in its discretion, and shall amend this Policy as\nit deems necessary to comply with applicable law or any rules or standards adopted by a national securities exchange on which the Company’s securities are listed.\n3\n11. Other Recoupment Rights; Company Claims\nThe Board intends that this Policy shall be applied to the fullest extent of the law. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other\nremedies or rights of recoupment that may be available to the Company under applicable law or pursuant to the terms of any similar policy in any employment agreement,\nequity award agreement, or similar agreement and any other legal remedies available to the Company.\nNothing contained in this Policy, and no recoupment or recovery as contemplated by this Policy, shall limit any claims, damages or other legal remedies the Company or any of\nits affiliates may have against a Covered Executive arising out of or resulting from any actions or omissions by the Covered Executive.\n12. Successors\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Executives and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n13. Exhibit Filing Requirement\nA copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto shall be posted on the Company’s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\nDATE: November 14, 2023\n4"
