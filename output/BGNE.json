(NASDAQ: BGNE; HKEX: 06160; SSE: 688235), a global oncology company that intends to change its name to BeOne Medicines, today announced that the European Commission has approved TEVIMBRA® (tislelizumab) in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma. \n\n“Patients diagnosed with advanced gastric and esophageal cancers confront median survival times measured in months, not years—highlighting the urgent need for more effective treatment options,” said Prof. Florian Lordick, Director and Professor of Oncology of the University Cancer Center Leipzig, Germany. “The compelling data from the RATIONALE-305 and 306 trials underscore the unique clinical profile of tislelizumab and its potential to deliver meaningful improvements in outcomes for eligible patients, offering new hope where it’s needed most.” \n\nIn ESCC, the expanded indication is for TEVIMBRA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 with a tumor area positivity (TAP) score ≥ 5%. In G/GEJ adenocarcinoma, the expanded indication is for TEVIMBRA in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 with a TAP score ≥ 5%. \n\n“As the cornerstone of our solid tumor portfolio, TEVIMBRA is central to BeiGene’s commitment to delivering innovative treatments to as many people living with cancer as possible, with more than 1.3 million patients already treated with the medicine worldwide,\" said Mark Lanasa, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Solid Tumors at BeiGene. \"In just over a year, we have achieved approvals in the European Union across six indications, and we look forward to working to ensure that patients across Europe have rapid and broad access to TEVIMBRA.” \n\nIn first-line ESCC, the extension of indication application was based on results from BeiGene’s RATIONALE-306 ([NCT03783442](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F37080222%2F&esheet=54158651&newsitemid=20241127759978&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03783442&index=1&md5=2f3ff951955c03b05b44c8d5f0b4d642)), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, global Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced recurrent or metastatic ESCC. The study enrolled 649 patients at research centers across Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. The study met its primary endpoint, with first-line TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy resulting in statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS benefit compared with placebo plus chemotherapy in the intent-to-treat population. The median OS was 17.2 months for TEVIMBRA with chemotherapy versus 10.6 months for placebo plus chemotherapy (HR: 0.66 [95% CI, 0.54-0.80, 1-sided p-value of < 0.0001]), a 34% reduction in the risk of death. Three-year OS in the PD-L1 ≥ 5% population was also substantially improved in favor of the TEVIMBRA arm (median 19.1 versus 10.0 months, respectively; HR: 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79]), demonstrating a 38% reduction in the risk of death. \n\nThe extension of indication application for first-line G/GEJ cancer was based on results from BeiGene’s RATIONALE-305 ([NCT03777657](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclinicaltrials.gov%2Fsearch%3Fterm%3DNCT03777657&esheet=54158651&newsitemid=20241127759978&lan=en-US&anchor=NCT03777657&index=2&md5=f6a7689194b5c2001f124a8af8f460f9)), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TEVIMBRA in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic G/GEJ cancer. The study enrolled 997 patients at research centers across Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. The study met its primary endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival (OS) benefit with a median OS of 15.0 months for patients treated with TEVIMBRA in combination with investigator’s choice of chemotherapy compared to 12.9 months for patients treated with placebo plus chemotherapy (n=997; HR: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.92]; P=0.0011), resulting in a 20% reduction in the risk of death. In the PD-L1 ≥ 5% population, the median OS was 16.4 months for TEVIMBRA plus chemotherapy compared to 12.8 months for the placebo arm (HR: 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.86]), which represents a 29% reduction in the risk of death. \n\nThe safety data in the applications included more than 2,800 patients who received TEVIMBRA as either monotherapy (1,534) or in combination with chemotherapy (1,319) at the approved dosing regimen. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥ 2%) for TEVIMBRA given in combination with chemotherapy were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, pneumonia, decreased appetite, rash, lymphopenia, alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, diarrhea, pneumonitis, and hepatitis. \n\nTEVIMBRA is also approved in the EU for eligible patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic ESCC after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and for three NSCLC indications covering both the first- and second-line settings. \n\nThe Company recently announced its intent to change its name to BeOne Medicines Ltd., reaffirming its commitment to develop innovative medicines to eliminate cancer by partnering with the global community to serve as many patients as possible. \n\n**About Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction (G/GEJ) Adenocarcinoma**\n\nGastric (stomach) cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the fifth highest leading cause of cancer mortality.1 Nearly 1 million new patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer in 2022, and 660,000 deaths were reported globally. Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma occurs at the area where the esophagus joins the stomach, which is just beneath the diaphragm (the thin sheet of breathing muscle under the lungs).2\n\n**About Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)**\n\nGlobally, esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths, and ESCC is the most common histologic subtype, accounting for nearly 90% of esophageal cancers. An estimated 957,000 new esophageal cancer cases are projected in 2040, an increase of nearly 60% from 2020, underscoring the need for additional effective treatments.3 Esophageal cancer is a rapidly fatal disease, and more than two-thirds of patients have advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, with an expected five-year survival rate of less than 6% for those with distant metastases.4\n\n**About TEVIMBRA (Tislelizumab)**\n\nTEVIMBRA is a uniquely designed humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity against PD-1. It is designed to minimize binding to Fc-gamma (Fcγ) receptors on macrophages, helping the body’s immune cells detect and fight tumors. \n\nTEVIMBRA is the foundational asset of BeiGene’s solid tumor portfolio and has shown potential across multiple tumor types and disease settings. The global TEVIMBRA clinical development program includes almost 14,000 patients enrolled to date in 34 counties and regions across 66 trials, including 20 registration-enabling studies. TEVIMBRA is approved in 42 countries, and more than 1.3 million patients have been treated globally. \n\n**Important Safety Information**\n\nThe current European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for TEVIMBRA is available from the [European Medicines Agency](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ema.europa.eu%2Fen%2Fmedicines%2Fhuman%2FEPAR%2Ftevimbra&esheet=54158651&newsitemid=20241127759978&lan=en-US&anchor=European+Medicines+Agency&index=3&md5=e7a9f0b2e82e7d709bd99527645d8ed8). \n\nThis information is intended for a global investor and media audience. Product indications vary by region. \n\n**About BeiGene**\n\nBeiGene, which plans to change its name to BeOne Medicines Ltd., is a global oncology company that is discovering and developing innovative treatments that are more affordable and accessible to cancer patients worldwide.

Oyler, Co-Founder, Chairman and CEO at BeiGene. “In the U.S., BRUKINSA, with the broadest label of any BTK inhibitor, is now the leader in new patient starts in both frontline and relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL in addition to all other approved B-cell malignancies. As the cornerstone of our hematology franchise, BRUKINSA shows tremendous promise for patients as a monotherapy and as a backbone for best-in-class combinations with our late-stage BCL2 inhibitor, sonrotoclax, and BTK degrader BGB-16673. In the solid tumor area, we’re expanding access to our PD-1 inhibitor, TEVIMBRA, for patients worldwide and building global commercial capabilities to support our prolific pipeline of exciting potential cancer medicines. We are laying the foundation for future franchises in breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers across three signature platform technologies including multi-specific antibodies, protein degraders, and antibody-drug conjugates. This progress not only highlights our achievements but also emphasizes our commitment to positively impacting patients' lives globally, fostering hope and advancements in the fight against cancer.”\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Snapshot\n\n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars and Unaudited)\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, |  Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n(in thousands, except percentages) |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change |  2024 |  2023 |  % Change  \nNet product revenues |  $ |  993,447 |  $ |  595,290 |  67 |  % |  $ |  2,661,511 |  $ |  1,559,326 |  71 |  %  \nNet revenue from collaborations |  $ |  8,152 |  $ |  186,018 |  (96 |  )% |  $ |  20,906 |  $ |  265,044 |  (92 |  )%  \nTotal Revenue |  $ |  1,001,599 |  $ |  781,308 |  28 |  % |  $ |  2,682,417 |  $ |  1,824,370 |  47 |  %  \nGAAP loss from operations |  $ |  (120,265 |  ) |  $ |  (133,968 |  ) |  (10 |  )% |  $ |  (488,774 |  ) |  $ |  (823,941 |  ) |  (41 |  )%  \nAdjusted income(loss) from operations* |  $ |  65,630 |  $ |  (16,339 |  ) |  502 |  % |  $ |  (33,247 |  ) |  $ |  (485,249 |  ) |  (93 |  )%  \n  \n_* For an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures refer to the \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section later in this press release and for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measures, see the table at the end of this press release._\n\nKey Business Updates\n\n_BRUKINSA ® (zanubrutinib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of BTK designed to deliver complete and sustained inhibition of the BTK protein by optimizing bioavailability, half-life, and selectivity. With differentiated pharmacokinetics compared with other approved BTK inhibitors, BRUKINSA has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation of malignant B cells within a number of disease-relevant tissues. BRUKINSA has the broadest label globally of any BTK inhibitor and is the only BTK inhibitor to provide the flexibility of once or twice daily dosing. The global BRUKINSA clinical development program includes about 6,000 patients enrolled in 30 countries and regions across more than 35 trials. BRUKINSA is approved in more than 70 markets, and more than 100,000 patients have been treated globally._\n\n  * U.S. sales of BRUKINSA totaled $504 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing growth of 87% over the prior-year period, with more than 60% of the quarter over quarter demand growth coming from expanded use in CLL as BRUKINSA continued to gain share in CLL new patient starts; BRUKINSA sales in Europe totaled $97 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing growth of 217%, driven by increased market share across all major markets, including Germany, Italy, Spain, France and the UK;\n  * Five-year follow-up results from cohort 1 of the Phase 3 SEQUOIA study showed sustained progression-free survival (PFS) benefit (54-month PFS rate of 80%) with BRUKINSA in patients with treatment-naïve (TN) CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with no new safety signals observed; detailed data will be presented at the annual American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2024 conference; and\n  * Five-year follow-up data of BOVen (zanubrutinib, obinutuzumab, venetoclax) study in TN CLL demonstrates frequent unmeasurable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in peripheral blood (96%) and bone marrow (92%), and uMRD was durable with a median MRD-free survival of 34 months; detailed data will be presented at the ASH 2024 conference.\n\n\n\n_TEVIMBRA ® (tislelizumab)_  _is a uniquely designed humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody with high affinity and binding specificity against PD-1; it is designed to minimize binding to Fc-gamma (Fcγ) receptors on macrophages, helping to aid the body’s immune cells to detect and fight tumors._  _TEVIMBRA is the foundational asset of BeiGene’s solid tumor portfolio and has shown potential across multiple tumor types and disease settings. The global TEVIMBRA clinical development program includes almost 14,000 patients enrolled to date in 34 counties and regions across 66 trials, including 20 registration-enabling studies. TEVIMBRA is approved in 42 countries and regions, and more than 1.3 million patients have been treated globally._\n\n  * Sales of tislelizumab totaled $163 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing growth of 13% compared to the prior-year period;\n  * Announced commercial availability in the U.S. for second-line esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and in the first European countries for second-line ESCC and first- and second-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC);\n  * Received positive opinions from the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) as a first-line treatment for advanced/metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer and ESCC;\n  * Received China National Medical Products Administration approval for neo-adjuvant/adjuvant NSCLC; and\n  * Further expanded global footprint with new approvals in Brazil (second-line NSCLC, second-line ESCC), Singapore (first- and second-line NSCLC, second-line ESCC), Thailand (first- and second-line NSCLC, first- and second-line ESCC and first-line gastric cancer) and Israel (second-line ESCC).\n\n\n\nKey Pipeline Highlights\n\nBeiGene’s portfolio strategy emphasizes rapid generation of early-stage clinical proof-of-concept data enabled by its speed- and cost-advantaged (“Fast to Proof of Concept”) approach to global clinical operations. The Company’s in-house global research and development team, including clinical operations and development, is comprised of more than 3,600 colleagues conducting trials across five continents and ensuring rigorous data quality through collaborations with regulators and investigators in over 45 countries. This strategic approach maximizes resources by channeling data-gated investments into the most promising clinically differentiated candidates quickly and de-prioritizing others. With one of the largest oncology research teams in the industry, BeiGene has demonstrated strengths in translational small molecule and biologics discovery, including three platform technologies: multi-specific antibodies, chimeric degradation activation compounds (CDACs), and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). For NMEs entering the clinic, BeiGene has industry leading preclinical, dose escalation cohort and dose escalation to dose expansion timings. Two examples of the Company’s speed advantage resulting from its internal innovation at scale:\n\n  * CDK4i entered the clinic in December 2023; 6.4 weeks on average for dose-escalation cohorts with more than 100 patients;\n  * B7H4 ADC entered the clinic in April 2024;

The reacquisition of the full global commercial rights to ociperlimab and TEVIMBRA in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in the recognition of the remaining deferred revenues from the former Novartis collaborations, which contributed $183 million of the total revenue in the prior year period.\n\nProduct Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $993 million, compared to $595 million in the same period of 2023, representing an increase of 67%. The increase in product revenue was primarily attributable to increased sales of BRUKINSA. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the U.S. was the Company’s largest market, with product revenue of $504 million, compared to $270 million in the prior year period. In addition to BRUKINSA revenue growth, product revenues were positively impacted by growth from in-licensed products from Amgen and tislelizumab.\n\nGross Margin as a percentage of global product revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 83%, compared to 84% in the prior-year period on a GAAP basis and 85%, compared to 84% in the prior-year period on an adjusted basis. The GAAP gross margin percentage decrease compared to the prior-year period was the result of accelerated depreciation expense of $17 million resulting from the move to more efficient, larger scale production lines for tislelizumab, and with a similar amount to be incurred in the fourth quarter related to this move. The adjusted gross margin percentage, which does not include the accelerated depreciation, increased primarily due to proportionally higher sales mix of global BRUKINSA compared to other products in the portfolio.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nThe following table summarizes operating expenses for the third quarter 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n\nGAAP |  Non-GAAP  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, in thousands, except percentages) |  Q3 2024 |  Q3 2023 |  % Change |  Q3 2024 |  Q3 2023 |  % Change  \nResearch and development |  $ |  496,179 |  $ |  453,259 |  9 |  % |  $ |  405,545 |  $ |  396,146 |  2 |  %  \nSelling, general and administrative |  $ |  455,223 |  $ |  365,708 |  24 |  % |  $ |  380,737 |  $ |  308,493 |  23 |  %  \nTotal operating expenses |  $ |  951,402 |  $ |  818,967 |  16 |  % |  $ |  786,282 |  $ |  704,639 |  12 |  %  \n  \nThe following table summarizes operating expenses for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively:\n\nGAAP |  Non-GAAP  \n---|---  \n(unaudited, in thousands, except percentages) |  Q3 YTD 2024 |  Q3 YTD 2023 |  % Change |  Q3 YTD 2024 |  Q3 YTD 2023 |  % Change  \nResearch and development |  $ |  1,411,283 |  $ |  1,284,607 |  10 |  % |  $ |  1,193,494 |  $ |  1,121,577 |  6 |  %  \nSelling, general and administrative |  $ |  1,326,379 |  $ |  1,089,616 |  22 |  % |  $ |  1,116,805 |  $ |  923,254 |  21 |  %  \nTotal operating expenses |  $ |  2,737,662 |  $ |  2,374,223 |  15 |  % |  $ |  2,310,299 |  $ |  2,044,831 |  13 |  %  \n  \nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, primarily due to advancing preclinical programs into the clinic and early clinical programs into late stage. Upfront fees and milestone payments related to in-process R&D for in-licensed assets totaled $5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $15 million in the prior-year period. Included within GAAP research and development expense for the third quarter of 2024 is $24.9 million of accelerated depreciation expense related to the move of clinical production to larger, more efficient production lines with approximately $2.0 million remaining to be incurred in the fourth quarter.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses increased for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period on both a GAAP and adjusted basis due to continued investment to support the global commercial launch of BRUKINSA, primarily in the U.S. and Europe. SG&A expenses as a percentage of product sales were 46% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 61% in the prior year period.\n\nGAAP Income (Loss) from Operations in the third quarter of 2024 operating loss decreased 10% compared to the prior-year-period primarily due to increased operating leverage. On an adjusted basis, we generated operating income of $66 million, an increase of $82 million from the prior year period. GAAP and adjusted loss from operations in the prior year period benefited from the recognition of the remaining deferred revenues from the Novartis collaboration agreements.\n\nGAAP Net Loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $121 million, compared to net income of $215 million in the prior-year period. Net income in the prior year period benefited from the non-operating gain of $363 million (pre and after-tax) related to the BMS arbitration settlement and the recognition of the remaining deferred revenues from the Novartis collaboration agreements. Net loss in the period continued to improve sequentially, as our product revenue growth and management of expenses is driving increased operating leverage.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net loss per basic ordinary share was $(0.09) and net loss per basic American Depositary Share (ADS) was $(1.15), compared to net income per basic ordinary share of $0.16 and net income per basic ADS of $2.06 in the prior-year period.\n\nCash Provided by Operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $188 million, an increase of $267 million over the prior-year period. The improvement in operating cash flows in the period was primarily driven by improved non-GAAP operating income and favorability in the period from working capital seasonality.\n\nFor further details on BeiGene’s Third Quarter 2024 Financial Statements, please see BeiGene’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAbout BeiGene\n\nBeiGene is a global oncology company that is discovering and developing innovative treatments that are more affordable and accessible to cancer patients worldwide.

These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information on BeiGene’s operating performance. Adjustments to BeiGene’s GAAP figures exclude, as applicable, non-cash items such as share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. Certain other special items or substantive events may also be included in the non-GAAP adjustments periodically when their magnitude is significant within the periods incurred. BeiGene maintains an established non-GAAP policy that guides the determination of what costs will be excluded in non-GAAP financial measures and the related protocols, controls and approval with respect to the use of such measures. BeiGene believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP figures, can enhance an overall understanding of BeiGene’s operating performance. The non-GAAP financial measures are included with the intent of providing investors with a more complete understanding of the Company’s historical and expected financial results and trends and to facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to projected information. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the indicators BeiGene’s management uses for planning and forecasting purposes and measuring the Company’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nRECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES  \n---  \n(Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars)  \n(unaudited)  \nThree Months Ended |  Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30, |  September 30,  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nReconciliation of GAAP to adjusted cost of sales - products:  \nGAAP cost of sales - products |  $ |  170,462 |  $ |  96,309 |  $ |  433,529 |  $ |  274,088  \nLess: Depreciation |  19,589 |  2,320 |  24,618 |  6,680  \nLess: Amortization of intangibles |  1,186 |  981 |  3,546 |  2,620  \nAdjusted cost of sales - products |  $ |  149,687 |  $ |  93,008 |  $ |  405,365 |  $ |  264,788  \nReconciliation of GAAP to adjusted research and development:  \nGAAP research and development |  $ |  496,179 |  $ |  453,259 |  $ |  1,411,283 |  $ |  1,284,607  \nLess: Share-based compensation cost |  47,670 |  44,150 |  141,121 |  124,126  \nLess: Depreciation |  42,964 |  12,963 |  76,668 |  38,904  \nAdjusted research and development |  $ |  405,545 |  $ |  396,146 |  $ |  1,193,494 |  $ |  1,121,577  \nReconciliation of GAAP to adjusted selling, general and administrative:  \nGAAP selling, general and administrative |  $ |  455,223 |  $ |  365,708 |  $ |  1,326,379 |  $ |  1,089,616  \nLess: Share-based compensation cost |  66,933 |  51,969 |  192,890 |  150,710  \nLess: Depreciation |  7,475 |  3,959 |  16,606 |  13,990  \nLess: Amortization of intangibles |  78 |  1,287 |  78 |  1,662  \nAdjusted selling, general and administrative |  $ |  380,737 |  $ |  308,493 |  $ |  1,116,805 |  $ |  923,254  \nReconciliation of GAAP to adjusted operating expenses  \nGAAP operating expenses |  $ |  951,402 |  $ |  818,967 |  $ |  2,737,662 |  $ |  2,374,223  \nLess: Share-based compensation cost |  114,603 |  96,119 |  334,011 |  274,836  \nLess: Depreciation |  50,439 |  16,922 |  93,274 |  52,894  \nLess: Amortization of intangibles |  78 |  1,287 |  78 |  1,662  \nAdjusted operating expenses |  $ |  786,282 |  $ |  704,639 |  $ |  2,310,299 |  $ |  2,044,831  \nReconciliation of GAAP to adjusted income (loss) from operations:  \nGAAP loss from operations |  $ |  (120,265 |  ) |  $ |  (133,968 |  ) |  $ |  (488,774 |  ) |  $ |  (823,941 |  )  \nPlus: Share-based compensation cost |  114,603 |  96,119 |  334,011 |  274,836  \nPlus: Depreciation |  70,028 |  19,242 |  117,892 |  59,574  \nPlus: Amortization of intangibles |  1,264 |  2,268 |  3,624 |  4,282  \nAdjusted income (loss) from operations |  $ |  65,630 |  $ |  (16,339 |  ) |  $ |  (33,247 |  ) |  $ |  (485,249 |  )  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241112799807r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com/): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241112799807/en/>\n\nInvestorsLiza Heapes+1 857-302-5663ir@beigene.com\n\nMediaKyle Blankenship+1 667-351-5176media@beigene.com\n\nSource: BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nBack \n"

Examples of such forward-looking statements include statements regarding the progress of BeiGene's solid\ntumor pipeline and future molecules to enter the clinic; speed of BeiGene's future growth and projected leadership in oncology; projected size of certain oncology\nmarket sectors; global impact of Tevimbra; BeiGene’s research, discovery, and pre-clinical and early-stage clinical programs and plans; recent clinical data for\nBeiGene’s product candidates and approvals of its medicines; the conduct of late-stage clinical trials and expected data readouts; and the advancement of and\nanticipated clinical development, regulatory milestones and commercialization of BeiGene’s medicines and drug candidates. Actual results may differ materially from\nthose indicated in the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including BeiGene's ability to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of its drug\ncandidates; the clinical results for its drug candidates, which may not support further development or marketing approval; actions of regulatory agencies, which may\naffect the initiation, timing and progress of clinical trials and marketing approval; BeiGene's ability to achieve commercial success for its marketed medicines and drug\ncandidates, if approved; BeiGene's ability to obtain and maintain protection of intellectual property for its technology and medicines; BeiGene's reliance on third\nparties to conduct drug development, manufacturing, commercialization, and other services; BeiGene’s limited experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and\ncommercializing pharmaceutical products; BeiGene's ability to obtain additional funding for operations and to complete the development of its drug candidates and\nachieve and maintain profitability; and those risks more fully discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in BeiGene’s most recent periodic report filed with the\nSEC, as well as discussions of potential risks, uncertainties, and other important factors in BeiGene's subsequent filings with the SEC. All information in this\npresentation is as of the date of this presentation, and BeiGene undertakes no duty to update such information unless required by law.\nSome of the clinical data in this presentation relating to BeiGene’s investigational drug candidates is from pre-clinical studies or early phase, single-arm clinical trials.\nWhen such data or data from later stage trials are presented in relation to other investigational or marketed drug products, the presentation and discussion are not\nbased on head-to-head trials between BeiGene’s investigational drug candidates and other products unless specified in the trial protocol. BeiGene is still conducting\npre-clinical studies and clinical trials and, as additional patients are enrolled and evaluated, data on BeiGene’s investigational drug candidates may change.\nThis presentation and any accompanying oral presentation contain data and information obtained from third-party studies and internal company analysis of such data\nand information.
