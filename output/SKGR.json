          "content": "SK GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES CORPORATION\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES\nSK Growth Opportunities Corporation (the “Company”) is committed to developing\neffective, transparent and accountable corporate governance practices. These Corporate\nGovernance Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) were approved by the Company’s board of directors\n(the “Board”) as a set of guiding principles by which the affairs of the Company will be governed.\nThe Board intends that these guidelines serve as a flexible framework within which the Board may\nconduct its business, not as a set of binding legal obligations.\nThese Guidelines do not change or interpret the Company’s amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association or any amendment or restatement thereof (the “Articles”),\nor any other governing documents, including, without limitation, the charters of any committee of\nthe Board. These Guidelines are not intended to change or augment the obligations of the Company\nor its directors or management under the federal securities laws or rules and regulations of the\napplicable stock exchange on which the Company’s securities are then listed or to create new\nstandards for determining whether directors or management have fulfilled their duties, including\nfiduciary duties under applicable law.\nThese Guidelines are subject to modification by the Board.\n1. BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES\n(a) Responsibilities of the Board\nThe business of the Company is conducted by management under the direction of the Chief\nExecutive Officer. The Board’s responsibility is to oversee, on behalf of shareholders, the conduct\nof the Company’s business, to provide advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer and\nsenior management, to protect the Company’s best interests and to foster the creation of long-term\nvalue for shareholders.\nAmong other things, the Board’s decision-making responsibilities include:\n(i) review and approval of the Company’s plans, strategies, objectives and\npolicies, as developed by the Chief Executive Officer and senior\nmanagement;\n(ii) approval of director candidates recommended by the Nominating\nCommittee of the Board (the “Nominating Committee”) for election by\nshareholders at the annual meeting; and\n(iii) approval of material investments or divestitures, strategic transactions,\nrelated party transactions and other significant transactions not in the\nordinary course of the Company’s business.\nAmong other things, the Board’s oversight responsibilities include monitoring and/or\nmaking inquiries concerning:\n(i) the Company’s performance in relation to its plans, strategies, financial and\nnonfinancial objectives;\n(ii) the performance and effectiveness of the Company’s management team;\n(iii) succession and development plans for key Company executives, including\nthe Chief Executive Officer;\n(iv) the various committees of the Board;\n(v) through the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”),\nevaluating the integrity of the Company’s accounting and financial\nreporting systems, including the audit of the Company’s annual financial\nstatements by the independent auditors, and that appropriate systems of\ncontrol are in place. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on a regular\nbasis and the Board, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee,\ntakes the actions that are necessary to ensure the integrity of the Company’s\naccounting and financial reporting systems and that appropriate controls are\nin place; and\n(vi) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\nIn carrying out their responsibilities, Board members will exercise their business judgment\nand act in ways that they reasonably believe will serve the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders. As appropriate, the Board may also consider the interests of other stakeholders,\nincluding employees, customers, lenders and the members of the communities in which the\nCompany operates.\n(b) Expectations of Board Members\nBoard members are expected to:\n(i) become and remain informed about the Company, its business and its\nindustry;\n(ii) attend all meetings of the Board and of Board committees on which they\nserve, having read and considered any materials distributed in advance of\nthe meeting; and\n(iii) participate constructively in Board and committee meetings, drawing upon\ntheir individual experience, knowledge and background, as appropriate, to\nprovide perspectives and insights.\nDirectors are encouraged to attend each annual meeting of shareholders of the Company.\n2\n2. BOARD OPERATIONS\n(a) Board Size\nThe number of directors that constitutes the Board will be fixed from time to time in\naccordance with the provisions of the Articles of the Company then in effect.\n(b) Board Independence\nIt is the Board’s policy that a majority of the directors will be “independent” as that term\nis defined in the marketplace rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). The Board may\nalso examine other factors that will contribute to effective oversight and decision-making by the\nBoard, provided, however, that so long as the Company is subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations,\nthe Company will meet any requirements therein, including with respect to director independence.\n(c) Board Meetings\nThe Board plans to hold four regular meetings each year and may hold additional or special\nmeetings whenever necessary, but may hold fewer prior to the Company’s initial business\ncombination. Regular Board meetings and special meetings may be held either in person or by\nconference call. The Board may also act by unanimous written consent.\n(d) Board Agendas\nIn preparation for meetings of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, with support from\nthe Chief Financial Officer of the Company and such other officers as the Chief Executive Officer\nor Chief Financial Officer shall designate, shall disseminate to directors on a timely basis briefing\nmaterials regarding matters to be included in the meeting agenda, as well as minutes from prior\nmeetings and any written reports by committees of the Board. Each Board member may suggest\ninclusion of items on the agenda and may raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not\nspecifically on the agenda for that meeting.\n(e) Board Materials Distributed in Advance\nInformation and materials that are important to the Board’s understanding of the agenda\nitems and other topics to be considered at a Board or committee meeting should, to the extent\npracticable and appropriate, be distributed sufficiently in advance of the meeting to permit prior\nreview by the directors. Directors are expected to have reviewed and be prepared to discuss all\nmaterials distributed in advance of any meeting.\n(f) Board Committees\nThe Board currently has the following standing committees: Audit Committee, Nominating\nCommittee and Compensation Committee. The committees’ charters are posted on the Company’s\nwebsite. From time to time, the Board may form a new committee or disband a current committee\ndepending on the circumstances. Each committee and its members will comply with the\nindependence and other requirements as detailed in the committee’s applicable charter and as\n3\nestablished by applicable law and regulations, including Securities and Exchange Commission and\nNasdaq rules, within any required timeframes.\nThe Nominating Committee may make recommendations to the Board relative to\ncommittee members and chairs consistent with the membership criteria outlined in the applicable\ncommittee charter. Committee appointments are subject to approval of the majority of the full\nBoard. The Board may replace any committee chairs or members or add additional members to a\nBoard committee at any time during the year.\nMembers of all standing committees are appointed by the Board. The Board determines\nthe exact number of members and can at any time remove or replace a committee member. The\nchair of each committee of the Board will, in consultation with appropriate committee members\nand members of management, and in accordance with the committee’s charter, determine the\nfrequency and length of committee meetings and develop the committee’s agenda.\n(g) Separate Sessions of Independent Directors\nNasdaq rules require independent Board members to meet in regularly scheduled executive\nsessions without non-independent directors. The Board’s policy is to hold executive sessions\nwithout the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and other non-\nindependent directors, in connection with each regularly scheduled Board meeting or as is\notherwise required by Nasdaq rules and regulations, and at other times as necessary. Committees\nof the Board may also meet in executive session as deemed appropriate.\n3. DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND BOARD COMPOSITION\n(a) Director Criteria\nThe Company seeks to align Board composition with the Company’s strategic direction so\nthat Board members bring skills, experience and backgrounds that are relevant to the key strategic\nand operational issues that they will oversee and approve. Director candidates are typically\nselected based for their integrity and character, sound, independent judgment, track record of\naccomplishment in leadership roles, as well as their professional and corporate expertise, skills\nand experience. Criteria that are typically considered by the Board in the selection of directors\ninclude:\n(i) should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business,\neducation or public service;\n(ii) should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make\na significant contribution to the Board and bring a range of skills, diverse\nperspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and\n(iii) should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism\nand intense dedication to serving the interests of the shareholders.\n4\n(b) Regulatory Requirements\nThe Nominating Committee reviews Board and committee composition at least annually\nto ensure that the Company complies with Nasdaq and any other regulatory requirements. In so\ndoing, the Nominating Committee conducts a review of the independence of all members of the\nBoard for the purposes of determining whether Board members are “independent” under\napplicable Nasdaq rules and regulations. Board members must notify the Chairman of the\nNominating Committee, as soon as practicable, in the event that their circumstances change in a\nmanner that may impact the committee’s view of their independence.\n(c) Nominating Process\nThe nominating process outlined herein applies only with respect to the nomination of\ndirector candidates who will be presented to the Company’s shareholders for election at the annual\nmeeting, if any. Where a third party has the right to propose for nomination one or more directors\nto the Company’s Board, the selection and nomination of such directors need not be subject to this\nprocess.\n(i) The Nominating Committee is responsible for screening and recommending\nto the Board nominees for election as directors of the Company, including\nnominees recommended by shareholders of the Company. When\nformulating its Board membership recommendations, the Nominating\nCommittee will consider advice and recommendations from shareholders,\nmanagement and others, as it deems appropriate, and will also take into\naccount the performance of incumbent directors in determining whether to\nrecommend them to stand for reelection at the annual meeting of\nshareholders.\n(ii) After the completion of interviews (including, as appropriate, with other\nBoard members, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior\nmanagement) and reference checks of identified candidates, the Nominating\nCommittee will meet in person or by conference call to discuss and make\nrecommendations to the Board with respect to the candidates. The full\nBoard will then vote on the Nominating Committee’s recommendations.\nThose candidates approved by a majority of the Board shall be nominated\nfor election by the Company’s shareholders at the next annual meeting.\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company will contact any candidate(s)\nso approved, invite them to attend the Company’s annual meeting and to join the Board at its first\nmeeting thereafter, if they are elected by the Company’s shareholders at the annual meeting. In the\ncase of a Board candidate appointed between annual meetings, the same nominating process will\ngenerally apply except that the approved candidate will be invited to join the Board at its next\nmeeting after his or her approval by the Board.\n(d) Director Terms\nSubject to any rights of the holders of any series of preference shares to elect additional\ndirectors under specified circumstances, the directors of the Company shall be divided into three\n5\nclasses as nearly equal in size as is practicable, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term\nof office of the initial Class I directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders\noccurring after the Company’s initial public offering; the term of office of the initial Class II\ndirectors shall expire at the second annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s\ninitial public offering; and the term of office of the initial Class III directors shall expire at the\nthird annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial public offering. At each\nannual meeting after the first annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial\npublic offering, each director elected to the class of directors expiring at such annual meeting shall\nbe elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until his or her successor\nshall have been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or\nretirement.\nDirectors who are appointed by third parties having the right to appoint one or more Board\nmembers shall be subject to the terms of appointment established by such third party pursuant to\nits legal rights with the Company.\n(e) Change of Position\nThe Board does not believe that directors who retire or change the position they held when\nthey became a member of the Board should necessarily leave the Board. Promptly following such\nevent, the director must notify the Nominating Committee, which shall review the continued\nappropriateness of the affected director remaining on the Board under the circumstances. The\naffected director is expected to act in accordance with the Nominating Committee’s\nrecommendation following such review.\n(f) Limitations on Board Service\nThe Board does not believe that its members should generally be prohibited from serving\non boards and/or committees of other organizations, and the Board has not adopted any guidelines\nlimiting such activities. However, prior to becoming a director of another public company, a\ndirector of the Company shall notify the Chairman of the Nominating Committee, the Chairman\nof the Board and the Chief Executive Officer to address whether the aggregate number of\ndirectorships held by such director would interfere with his or her ability to carry out his or her\nresponsibilities as a director of the Company. (Additionally, the Audit Committee will be informed\nif there is concern that any directorship with another company might create a conflict of interest.)\nIn the event that the Board determines that the additional directorship constitutes a conflict of\ninterest or interferes with such director’s ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a director\nof the Company, such director, upon the request of the Board, shall either offer his or her\nresignation or not accept the other directorship.\n4. DIRECTOR ACCESS TO MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT ADVISORS\n(a) Access to Management\nDirectors shall have full and unrestricted access to any relevant Company records and may\nrequest that any officer or other employee of the Company or the Company’s outside counsel or\naccountants meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Board or any committee. As a\ncourtesy, directors will exercise their judgment to ensure that this access does not impede or\n6\ninterfere with the conduct of the Company’s business and is coordinated, where possible, through\nthe Chief Executive Officer, so as not to undermine normal lines of management authority.\n(b) Access to Independent Advisors\nIn their sole discretion, the Board and each of its committees shall have the sole authority\nand responsibility to select, employ, retain (including approving compensation and terms with\nrespect to such retention) and terminate any financial, legal, executive search, consulting and other\nprofessional advisors as they deem necessary or appropriate to assist in the discharge of their\nresponsibilities. The Company shall pay the professional fees and reasonable expenses of any such\nindependent advisors retained by the Board or any of its committees.\n5. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board (the “Compensation Committee”) shall\nestablish the amount and form of compensation to be paid to Company directors.

The Board shall review\nits directors’ compensation policy annually.

Directors are also encouraged\nto take advantage of any other available educational opportunities that would further their\nunderstanding of the business of the Company and enhance their performance on the Board.\n7. EXECUTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING AND RETENTION\nThe Board will receive updates and recommendations from the Compensation Committee\nregarding retention and succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other key\nmembers of the Company’s senior management team. The plan of succession includes an\nassessment of the experience, performance, skills and planned career paths for possible successors\nfor the Chief Executive Officer position and other key executive roles. The Compensation\nCommittee leads the annual review of the Chief Executive Officer’s performance, in which all\nBoard members provide input, and oversees the Chief Executive Officer’s performance review of\nsenior executives for purposes of compensation decisions, succession planning and leadership\ndevelopment. The Chief Executive Officer shall also provide the Board with an assessment of\npotential successors to key executive positions within the Company.\n8. ANNUAL SELF-EVALUATION\nThe Board and each committee thereof shall perform an annual self-evaluation of its\nperformance, with a particular focus on overall effectiveness. The Nominating Committee is\nresponsible for overseeing the self-evaluation process and for proposing any modifications or\nalterations in Board or committee practices, procedures or charters. The self-evaluation results and\nany recommendations made by the Nominating Committee to enhance the Board’s functioning\nwill be discussed by the full Board.\n9.
