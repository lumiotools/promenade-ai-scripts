(NASDAQ: CRON) (TSX: CRON) (“Cronos” or the “Company”) today announced its 2024 third quarter business results.\n\n“Our results this quarter demonstrate that our long-term strategy is working. With record net revenue and a disciplined approach to operating expenses, Cronos operates more efficiently and effectively than ever before, and we anticipate long-term margin improvement. Our consolidation of Cronos Growing Company has further strengthened our supply chain, which we anticipate will lead to improved margins and allow us to meet the increasing global demand for high-quality cannabis. With an industry-leading balance sheet, we are well-positioned to expand into new legal markets and drive future growth opportunities,” said Mike Gorenstein, Chairman, President and CEO, Cronos.\n\n“As international demand continues to rise, particularly in markets like Germany, the UK, and Australia, the investments we’ve made in our infrastructure and global partnerships are paying off,” continued Mr. Gorenstein. “In the third quarter, our award-winning Spinach® brand rose to become the best-selling cannabis brand in the Canadian adult-use market and our Peace Naturals® brand held a top spot in the Israeli medical market. Our brands' market share out-performance represents our relentless commitment to quality, innovation, and bringing differentiated products to the global cannabis market. The progress we’ve made reinforces our leadership in key categories and markets, and we remain focused on continuing to innovate and bring premium products to consumers.”\n\n1 Hifyre Retail Analytics – National Retail Dollar Sales by Brand in Canada – August 2024.\n\n**_Consolidated Financial Results_** On June 20, 2024 the Company made an additional investment in Cronos Growing Company (\" Cronos GrowCo\") to fund the expansion of cultivation operations. Cronos also obtained majority control of the board of directors of Cronos GrowCo and began consolidating Cronos GrowCo's results as of July 1, 2024. Prior to this date, the Company's investment in Cronos GrowCo consisted of an investment accounted for under the equity method and loans receivable from Cronos GrowCo.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Company exited its U.S. hemp-derived CBD operations. The exit of the U.S. operations represented a strategic shift, and as such, qualifies for reporting as discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). Prior period amounts have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations classification of the U.S. operations.\n\nThe tables below set forth our condensed consolidated results of continuing operations, expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars for the periods presented. Our condensed consolidated financial results for these periods are not necessarily indicative of the consolidated financial results that we will achieve in future periods.\n\n_(in thousands of USD)_| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Change**| **Nine months ended September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**  \nCronos net revenue, excluding Cronos GrowCo net revenue(i)| $| 29,996| $| 24,810| $| 5,186| 21| %| $| 83,046| $| 63,326| $| 19,720| 31| %  \nCronos GrowCo net revenue(ii)| 4,268| —| 4,268| N/A| 4,268| —| 4,268| N/A  \nNet revenue| $| 34,264| $| 24,810| $| 9,454| 38| %| $| 87,314| $| 63,326| $| 23,988| 38| %  \nCost of sales| 30,341| 20,124| 10,217| 51| %| 72,216| 52,614| 19,602| 37| %  \nInventory write-down| 312| 716| (404| )| (56| )%| 707| 716| (9| )| (1| )%  \nGross profit| $| 3,611| $| 3,970| $| (359| )| (9| )%| $| 14,391| $| 9,996| $| 4,395| 44| %  \nGross margin(iii)| 11| %| 16| %| N/A| (5) pp| 16| %| 16| %| N/A| —pp  \nInventory step-up recorded to cost of sales| 7,116| —| 7,116| N/A| 7,116| —| 7,116| N/A  \nAdjusted Gross Profit(iv)| $| 10,727| $| 3,970| $| 6,757| 170| %| $| 21,507| $| 9,996| $| 11,511| 115| %  \nAdjusted Gross Margin(v)| 31| %| 16| %| N/A| 15pp| 25| %| 16| %| N/A| 9pp  \nNet income (loss)| $| 7,324| $| (1,590| )| $| 8,914| N/M| $| (3,919| )| $| (25,288| )| $| 21,369| 85| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA(iv)| $| (6,019| )| $| (15,187| )| $| 9,168| 60| %| $| (27,739| )| $| (46,774| )| $| 19,035| 41| %  \n**Other Data**  \nCash and cash equivalents(vi)| $| 862,034| $| 571,656| $| 290,378| 51| %  \nShort-term investments(vi)| —| 267,905| (267,905| )| (100| )%  \nCapital expenditures(vii)| 6,536| 325| 6,211| 1,911| %| 9,446| 1,631| 7,815| 479| %  \n  \n_(i)__Cronos net revenue, excluding Cronos GrowCo net revenue is Net revenue less Cronos GrowCo net revenue and is after intercompany eliminations.__(ii)__Cronos GrowCo net revenue is Cronos GrowCo's net revenue after intercompany eliminations.__(iii)__Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by net revenue.__(iv)__See \"Non-GAAP Measures\" for more information, including a reconciliation of adjusted earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") to net income (loss) and a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit to gross profit.__(v)__Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net revenue.__(vi)__Dollar amounts are as of the last day of the period indicated.__(vii)__Capital expenditures represent component information of investing activities and is defined as the sum of purchase of property, plant and equipment, and purchase of intangible assets._\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024**\n\n  * Net revenue of $34.3 million in Q3 2024 increased by $9.5 million from Q3 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel, and sales to other international markets consisting of Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom (the \"UK\"). Cronos GrowCo contributed $4.3 million of cannabis flower sales in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n  * Gross profit of $3.6 million in Q3 2024 decreased by $0.4 million from Q3 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the impact on cost of sales from the inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the Cronos GrowCo transaction on July 1, 2024, partially offset by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel, and higher cannabis flower sales in other countries.\n  * Adjusted Gross Profit of $10.7 million in Q3 2024 increased by $6.8 million from Q3 2023. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin provide insight into underlying business trends to facilitate comparisons of period-over-period results by removing the impacts of inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the Cronos GrowCo transaction, which reflect a one-time event and do not reflect management's assessment of ongoing performance. The increase in Adjusted Gross Profit was driven by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel, and higher cannabis flower sales in other countries.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $(6.0) million in Q3 2024 improved by $9.2 million from Q3 2023. The improvement year-over-year was primarily driven by higher net revenue, improved Adjusted Gross Profit and a decrease in general and administrative expenses.\n\n\n\n**_Business Updates_**\n\n**Transaction with Cronos GrowCo** The global cannabis market continues to expand as international markets fuel an increasing demand for high-quality products. The investment in Cronos GrowCo’s facility expansion enables Cronos to increase supply of Cronos' unique portfolio of genetics which has helped the Company win in the highly competitive Canadian market, as well as expand Cronos’ international footprint with distribution to the growing markets in Australia, Germany, and the UK.\n\n**Key highlights of the transaction:**\n\n  * **Increased Board Representation** : As of July 1, 2024, the Cronos GrowCo board of directors expanded to five members, three of whom are appointed by Cronos.\n  * **Financial Consolidation** : Cronos now consolidates Cronos GrowCo’s results in its financial statements beginning in the third quarter of 2024.\n  * **Investment in Expansion** : Cronos provided an approximately $51 million ($70 million CAD) secured non-revolving credit facility to Cronos GrowCo to fund the expansion of Cronos GrowCo's cultivation and processing facilities, enabling growth opportunities in the markets Cronos operates in today as well as enabling Cronos to take advantage of future growth into new markets that open.\n  * **New Supply Agreement** : Prior to the commencement of sales from the expanded facility, Cronos will have the option to purchase up to 80% of Cronos GrowCo’s total production. Thereafter, Cronos will have the option to purchase up to 70% of the total production from the expanded facility.\n\n\n\n**Brand and Product Portfolio**\n\n**_Spinach_** ®\n\nIn Q3 2024, Spinach® was the top-selling cannabis brand in Canada according to Hifyre. This market share success highlights Cronos' unwavering dedication to quality, innovation, and delivering distinctive products to the competitive Canadian adult-use market.\n\nSpinach® has solidified itself as the go-to brand for a wide array of products featuring different cannabinoid combinations, potency ranges and flavor profiles. In the edibles category, the Spinach® brand held the number one position with a 17.2% market share in Q3 2024, according to Hifyre.\n\nIn Q3 2024, the Spinach® brand launched three new edible SKUs, which included the SOURZ by Spinach® Strawberry Watermelon 4:1 CBG|THC gummies, SOURZ by Spinach® Peach Passionfruit 1:1:1 CBN | CBD | THC gummies, and the brand's first limited edition SOURZ by Spinach® Caramel Green Apple gummies.\n\nCronos' strong cannabis cultivar breeding program and portfolio of genetics continued to drive growth, propelling the Spinach® brand to become the number one flower brand in Canada, with a 6.0% market share in Q3 2024, according to Hifyre.\n\nThe Spinach® brand was ranked fourth in the vape category in Q3 2024, holding a 6.4% market share, according to Hifyre. This performance was driven by popular products such as Spinach HITZ™, which introduced new Pink Lemonade and Rocket Icicle flavors, alongside line extensions in Spinach® 1.2g Vapes.\n\nIn Q3 2024, Spinach® was ranked eighth in the pre-roll category with 2.7% market share, according to Hifyre. In the sub-category of infused pre-rolls, the Spinach® Fully Charged infused pre-rolls have begun to make their mark and are trending towards becoming a top selling product. The infused pre-roll category is continuing to grow and we expect this category to be key to future growth for both Cronos and the industry, which is why we are committed to evolution and innovation of the pre-roll portfolio.\n\n**_PEACE NATURALS_**** _®_**\n\nIn Israel, PEACE NATURALS® continues to be a top-performing brand with a record volume of sales in Q3 2024, powered by Cronos' advanced genetic breeding program and high-quality cultivation capabilities. Despite the conflict involving Israel, Hamas, Iran and other stakeholders in the region, an incredibly competitive market and declining patient counts due to regulatory market structure shifts, the brand continues to out-perform in the Israeli cannabis market.\n\nIn Germany and the UK, we are experiencing strong traction with Cronos' proprietary genetics, such as GMO and Wedding Cake, under the PEACE NATURALS® brand. The expansion of Cronos GrowCo will help enable Cronos to execute on these growth opportunities and others as they become available.\n\n**Guidance and Outlook**\n\nThe Company reiterates its previously announced operating expense savings target of $5 to $10 million on a standalone basis in 2024 primarily driven by savings in general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development (\"R&D\"). The organizational and cost savings initiatives are intended to position the Company to drive profitable and sustainable growth over time. The operating expense savings target excludes the impact of the consolidation of Cronos GrowCo's results into the Company's financial statements.\n\nThese statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” below for information on the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.\n\n**_Conference Call_** The Company will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss 2024 Third Quarter business results. An audio replay of the call will be archived on the Company’s website for replay.

Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). This press release refers to measures not recognized under U.S. GAAP (“non-GAAP measures”). These non-GAAP measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these non-GAAP measures are provided as a supplement to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures to provide additional information regarding the results of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All non-GAAP measures presented in this press release are reconciled to their closest reported U.S. GAAP measure. Reconciliations of historical adjusted financial measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are provided below.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nManagement reviews Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes non-cash items and items that do not reflect management’s assessment of ongoing business performance. Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization adjusted for: share of (income) loss from equity method investments; impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets; impairment loss on long-lived assets; (gain) loss on revaluation of derivative liabilities; (gain) loss on revaluation of financial instruments; gain on revaluation of loan receivable; gain on revaluation of equity method investment; transaction costs related to strategic projects; loss on held-for-sale assets; impairment loss on other investments; foreign currency transaction loss; other, net; loss from discontinued operations; restructuring costs; inventory write-downs resulting from restructuring actions; share-based compensation; purchase accounting adjustment-related inventory step-up adjustments recorded through cost of sales; and financial statement review costs and reserves related to the restatements of our 2019 and 2021 interim financial statements (the “Restatements”), including the costs related to the settlement of the SEC's and the OSC's investigations of the Restatements and legal costs of defending shareholder class action complaints brought against us as a result of the 2019 restatement (see Part II, Item 1 “Legal Proceedings” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 for a discussion of the shareholder class action complaints relating to the restatement of the 2019 interim financial statements and the settlement of the SEC's and the OSC's investigations of the Restatements). Results are reported as total consolidated results, reflecting our reporting structure of one reportable segment.\n\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides the most useful insight into underlying business trends and results and provides a more meaningful comparison of period-over-period results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets.\n\nThe following tables set forth a reconciliation of Net income (loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:\n\n**Three months ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Continuing Operations**| **Discontinued Operations**| **Total**  \nNet income| $| 7,324| $| —| $| 7,324  \nInterest income, net| (12,460| )| —| (12,460| )  \nIncome tax benefit| (2,708| )| —| (2,708| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 3,567| —| 3,567  \nEBITDA| (4,277| )| —| (4,277| )  \nImpairment loss on long-lived assets(i)| 14,376| —| 14,376  \nRevaluation gain on loan receivable(ii)| (11,804| )| —| (11,804| )  \nGain on revaluation of equity method investment(iii)| (32,469| )| —| (32,469| )  \nLoss on revaluation of financial instruments(iv)| 293| —| 293  \nForeign currency transaction loss| 7,432| —| 7,432  \nTransaction costs(vi)| 334| —| 334  \nLoss on held-for-sale assets(vii)| 10,422| —| 10,422  \nOther, net(viii)| 315| —| 315  \nShare-based compensation(ix)| 2,262| —| 2,262  \nFinancial statement review costs(xi)| (19| )| —| (19| )  \nInventory step-up recorded to cost of sales(xiii)| 7,116| —| 7,116  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (6,019| )| $| —| $| (6,019| )  \n  \n**Three months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Continuing Operations**| **Discontinued Operations**| **Total**  \nNet loss| $| (1,590| )| $| (182| )| $| (1,772| )  \nInterest income, net| (13,375| )| (1| )| (13,376| )  \nIncome tax benefit| (1,254| )| —| (1,254| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 2,148| —| 2,148  \nEBITDA| (14,071| )| (183| )| (14,254| )  \nShare of income from equity method investments| (1,057| )| —| (1,057| )  \nLoss on revaluation of financial instruments(iv)| 5,291| —| 5,291  \nForeign currency transaction gain| (8,816| )| —| (8,816| )  \nOther, net(viii)| (974| )| (31| )| (1,005| )  \nRestructuring costs(ix)| 1,423| 28| 1,451  \nShare-based compensation(x)| 1,957| (4| )| 1,953  \nFinancial statement review costs(xi)| 344| —| 344  \nInventory write-down(xii)| 716| —| 716  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (15,187| )| $| (190| )| $| (15,377| )  \n  \n**Nine months ended September 30, 2024**  \n---  \n**Continuing Operations**| **Discontinued Operations**| **Total**  \nNet loss| $| (3,919| )| $| —| $| (3,919| )  \nInterest income, net| (40,156| )| —| (40,156| )  \nIncome tax benefit| (5,440| )| —| (5,440| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,811| —| 6,811  \nEBITDA| (42,704| )| —| (42,704| )  \nShare of income from equity method investments| (2,365| )| —| (2,365| )  \nImpairment loss on long-lived assets(i)| 16,350| —| 16,350  \nRevaluation gain on loan receivable(ii)| (11,804| )| —| (11,804| )  \nGain on revaluation of equity method investment(iii)| (32,469| )| —| (32,469| )  \nLoss on revaluation of financial instruments(iv)| 6,550| —| 6,550  \nImpairment loss on other investments(v)| 25,650| —| 25,650  \nForeign currency transaction gain| (12,370| )| —| (12,370| )  \nTransaction costs(vi)| 530| —| 530  \nLoss on held-for-sale assets(vii)| 10,422| —| 10,422  \nOther, net(viii)| 737| —| 737  \nRestructuring costs(ix)| 630| —| 630  \nShare-based compensation(x)| 6,513| —| 6,513  \nFinancial statement review costs(xi)| (525| )| —| (525| )  \nInventory step-up recorded to cost of sales(xiii)| 7,116| —| 7,116  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (27,739| )| $| —| $| (27,739| )  \n  \n**Nine months ended September 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Continuing Operations**| **Discontinued Operations**| **Total**  \nNet loss| $| (25,288| )| $| (4,238| )| $| (29,526| )  \nInterest income, net| (37,021| )| (9| )| (37,030| )  \nIncome tax benefit| (2,870| )| —| (2,870| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 6,689| 244| 6,933  \nEBITDA| (58,490| )| (4,003| )| (62,493| )  \nShare of income from equity method investments| (831| )| —| (831| )  \nImpairment loss on long-lived assets(i)| —| 205| 205  \nLoss on revaluation of financial instruments(iv)| 7,856| —| 7,856  \nForeign currency transaction gain| (3,999| )| —| (3,999| )  \nOther, net(viii)| (1,011| )| 132| (879| )  \nRestructuring costs(ix)| 1,423| 562| 1,985  \nShare-based compensation(x)| 6,823| 17| 6,840  \nFinancial statement review costs(xi)| 739| —| 739  \nInventory write-down(xii)| 716| 839| 1,555  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (46,774| )| $| (2,248| )| $| (49,022| )  \n  \n(i) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment loss on long-lived assets included $14,258 related to the write-down of our Ginkgo exclusive licenses.

Results are reported as total consolidated results, reflecting our reporting structure of one reportable segment.\n\nManagement believes that Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin provide useful insight into underlying business trends to facilitate comparisons of period-over-period results by removing the impacts of inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the Cronos GrowCo transaction, which reflect a one-time event and do not reflect management’s assessment of ongoing business performance.\n\n_(in thousands of USD)_| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Change**| **Nine months ended September 30,**| **Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**  \nNet revenue| $| 34,264| $| 24,810| $| 9,454| 38| %| $| 87,314| $| 63,326| $| 23,988| 38| %  \nGross profit| $| 3,611| $| 3,970| $| (359| )| (9| )%| $| 14,391| $| 9,996| $| 4,395| 44| %  \nInventory step-up recorded to cost of sales| 7,116| —| 7,116| N/M| 7,116| —| 7,116| N/M  \nAdjusted Gross Profit| $| 10,727| $| 3,970| $| 6,757| 170| %| $| 21,507| $| 9,996| $| 11,511| 115| %  \nGross margin(i)| 11| %| 16| %| N/A| (5)pp| 16| %| 16| %| N/A| —pp  \nAdjusted Gross Margin(ii)| 31| %| 16| %| N/A| 15pp| 25| %| 16| %| N/A| 9pp  \n  \n(i) Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by net revenue.\n\n(ii) Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by net revenue.\n\n**_Constant Currency_**\n\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have presented constant currency adjusted financial measures for net revenue, gross profit, gross profit margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment balances as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures. We present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying operations performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period income statement results in currencies other than U.S. dollars are converted into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates from the three and nine months comparative periods in 2023 rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the respective current periods; constant currency current and prior comparative balance sheet information is translated at the prior year-end spot rate rather than the current period spot rate. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in 2023. We have provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding the performance of our operations. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe table below sets forth certain measures of consolidated results from continuing operations on a constant currency basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 as well as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, both on an as-reported and constant currency basis (in thousands):\n\n**As Reported**| **As Adjusted for Constant Currency**  \n---|---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nNet revenue| $| 34,264| $| 24,810| $| 9,454| 38| %| $| 34,661| $| 9,851| 40| %  \nGross profit| 3,611| 3,970| (359| )| (9| )%| 3,608| (362| )| (9| )%  \nGross margin| 11| %| 16| %| N/A| (5)pp| 10| %| N/A| (6)pp  \nOperating expenses| 37,266| 25,745| 11,521| 45| %| 38,079| 12,334| 48| %  \nNet income (loss) from continuing operations| 7,324| (1,590| )| 8,914| N/M| 8,219| 9,809| N/M  \nAdjusted EBITDA| (6,019| )| (15,187| )| 9,168| 60| %| (6,514| )| 8,673| 57| %  \n**Nine months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Nine months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nNet revenue| $| 87,314| $| 63,326| $| 23,988| 38| %| $| 88,456| $| 25,130| 40| %  \nGross profit| 14,391| 9,996| 4,395| 44| %| 14,591| 4,595| 46| %  \nGross margin| 16| %| 16| %| N/A| —pp| 16| %| N/A| —pp  \nOperating expenses| 79,555| 73,160| 6,395| 9| %| 80,415| 7,255| 10| %  \nNet loss from continuing operations| (3,919| )| (25,288| )| 21,369| 85| %| (2,424| )| 22,864| 90| %  \nAdjusted EBITDA| (27,739| )| (46,774| )| 19,035| 41| %| (28,022| )| 18,752| 40| %  \n**As of September 30,**| **As of December 31,**| **As Reported Change**| **As of September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 862,034| $| 669,291| $| 192,743| 29| %| $| 865,277| $| 195,986| 29| %  \nShort-term investments| —| 192,237| (192,237| )| (100| )%| —| (192,237| )| (100| )%  \nTotal cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments| $| 862,034| $| 861,528| $| 506| —| %| $| 865,277| $| 3,749| —| %  \n  \n_Net revenue_\n\n**As Reported**| **As Adjusted for Constant Currency**  \n---|---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nCannabis flower| $| 26,328| $| 17,414| $| 8,914| 51| %| $| 26,601| $| 9,187| 53| %  \nCannabis extracts| 7,789| 7,268| 521| 7| %| 7,914| 646| 9| %  \nOther| 147| 128| 19| 15| %| 146| 18| 14| %  \nNet revenue| $| 34,264| $| 24,810| $| 9,454| 38| %| $| 34,661| $| 9,851| 40| %  \n  \n**As Reported**| **As Adjusted for Constant Currency**  \n---|---  \n**Nine months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Nine months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**|  **2023**| **$**| **%**|  **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nCannabis flower| $| 64,514| $| 44,556| $| 19,958| 45| %| $| 65,413| $| 20,857| 47| %  \nCannabis extracts| 22,580| 18,495| 4,085| 22| %| 22,823| 4,328| 23| %  \nOther| 220| 275| (55| )| (20| )%| 220| (55| )| (20| )%  \nNet revenue| $| 87,314| $| 63,326| $| 23,988| 38| %| $| 88,456| $| 25,130| 40| %  \n  \n**As Reported**| **As Adjusted for Constant Currency**  \n---|---  \n**Three months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Three months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nCanada| $| 24,067| $| 18,738| $| 5,329| 28| %| $| 24,509| $| 5,771| 31| %  \nIsrael| 7,259| 5,673| 1,586| 28| %| 7,201| 1,528| 27| %  \nOther countries| 2,938| 399| 2,539| 636| %| 2,951| 2,552| 640| %  \nNet revenue| $| 34,264| $| 24,810| $| 9,454| 38| %| $| 34,661| $| 9,851| 40| %  \n  \n**As Reported**| **As Adjusted for Constant Currency**  \n---|---  \n**Nine months ended September 30,**| **As Reported Change**| **Nine months ended September 30,**| **Constant Currency Change**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **$**| **%**| **2024**| **$**| **%**  \nCanada| $| 62,781| $| 46,767| $| 16,014| 34| %| $| 63,553| $| 16,786| 36| %  \nIsrael| 20,565| 16,160| 4,405| 27| %| 20,908| 4,748| 29| %  \nOther countries| 3,968| 399| 3,569| 894| %| 3,995| 3,596| 901| %  \nNet revenue| $| 87,314| $| 63,326| $| 23,988| 38| %| $| 88,456| $| 25,130| 40| %  \n  \nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue on a constant currency basis was $34.7 million, representing a 40% increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue on a constant currency basis was $88.5 million, representing a 40% increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and higher cannabis flower sales in other countries, partially offset by an adverse price/mix in the Canadian adult-use cannabis flower category driving increased excise tax payments as a percentage of net revenue. On a constant currency basis, the Cronos GrowCo transaction contributed $4.3 million of cannabis flower sales in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. No such sales were recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_Gross profit_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit on a constant currency basis was $3.6 million, representing a 9% decrease from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit on a constant currency basis was $14.6 million, representing a 46% increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a constant currency basis, gross profit decreased for the three-month comparative periods primarily due to the impact on cost of sales from the inventory step-up from the Cronos GrowCo transaction, partially offset by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and higher cannabis flower sales in other countries. For the nine month comparative period, the increase was primarily due to higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and higher cannabis flower sales in other countries, partially offset by the impact on cost of sales from the inventory step-up from the Cronos GrowCo transaction. On a constant currency basis, for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $7.2 million of inventory step-up from the Cronos GrowCo transaction in cost of sales. No such costs were recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_Operating expenses_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses on a constant currency basis were $38.1 million, representing a 48% increase from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating expenses on a constant currency basis were $80.4 million, representing a 10% increase from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the impairment of the Ginkgo exclusive licenses, partially offset by lower salaries and benefits, professional fees and restructuring costs.\n\n_Net income (loss) from continuing operations_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income from continuing operations on a constant currency basis was $8.2 million, representing an improvement of $9.8 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net loss from continuing operations on a constant currency basis was $2.4 million, representing an improvement of $22.9 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was $(6.5) million, representing a 57% improvement from the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Adjusted EBITDA on a constant currency basis was $(28.0) million, representing a 40% improvement from the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The improvement in Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 on a constant currency basis was driven by higher cannabis flower and extract sales in the Canadian market, higher cannabis flower sales in Israel and decreases in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an adverse price/mix in Canada in the cannabis flower category driving increased excise tax payments as a percentage of net revenue.\n\n_Cash and cash equivalents & short-term investments_\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on a constant currency basis was essentially unchanged at $865.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023.\n\n**Foreign currency exchange rates**\n\nAll currency amounts in this press release are stated in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency, unless otherwise noted.
