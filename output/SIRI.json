The company reported a net loss of\n$2.96 billion. Prior to the close of the transaction, Liberty completed an assessment of the fair value of the\ncompany’s goodwill based on a sustained lower share price, as SiriusXM’s share price converged with those of the\nLiberty tracking stocks heading into the closing. As a result, a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $3.36\nbillion was recorded. This non-cash charge does not impact the company’s cash flow, ongoing operations, or\nliquidity. Earnings per common diluted share were ($8.74) for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.82 in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nSiriusXM reported adjusted EBITDA of $693 million, representing a 7% decline year-over-year. This decrease in\nadjusted EBITDA was mainly due to lower subscriber revenue, partially offset by lower costs of services, personnel-\nrelated costs, and general and administrative expenses. The company maintained a relatively stable adjusted\nEBITDA margin of 32%.\n\"We made significant progress during the third quarter in transforming SiriusXM, highlighted by the completion of\nour transaction with Liberty Media. We are leveraging the strengths of our scaled audiences and strong business\nmodel to position for long-term growth and create value for our investors,\" said Jennifer Witz, Chief Executive\nOfficer. \"With a clear path forward that taps into both our subscription and advertising expertise, combined with our\nunique position in the media and entertainment industry, we are well-positioned to deliver the audio experiences\naudiences crave through an innovative platform with an expanded set of packages.\"\n“This quarter marked a significant milestone for SiriusXM as we completed our transition to an independent\ncompany. We are focused on executing our long-term strategy of strengthening our subscription business,\nenhancing our advertising offerings, and optimizing costs as we reinvest in the business. We saw promising growth\nin self-pay subscribers, with 14,000 net additions, and a 6% increase in podcast advertising revenue, which\nhighlights the potential for further expansion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $693 million with a strong\nmargin of 32%, underscoring our disciplined financial management,\" said Tom Barry, Chief Financial Officer. \"We\nare adjusting full-year revenue guidance to $8.675 billion due to softer second-half ad revenue but remain on track\nto generate approximately $2.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1 billion in free cash flow in 2024.\"\nSEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nSirius XM Holdings operates two complementary audio entertainment businesses — one of which is referred to as\n“SiriusXM” and the second of which is referred to as “Pandora and Off-Platform.” Further information regarding\nthese two segments will be contained in the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The financial highlights below exclude the impact of share-based payment expense.\nSiriusXM Third Quarter 2024 Segment Highlights\nSiriusXM Total Subscribers of 33 Million\nSiriusXM added approximately 14,000 self-pay subscribers in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a year-over-year\nimprovement primarily driven by lower churn. Paid promotional subscribers decreased by 114,000 as certain\nautomakers transitioned to unpaid or shorter-term paid promotional plans. Self-pay subscriber churn finished the\n2024 quarter at 1.6%, consistent with the third quarter of 2023. The SiriusXM trial funnel stood at approximately 7.3\nmillion at the end of the third quarter of 2024, down slightly from 7.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024\nand 7.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nSiriusXM Revenue of $1.6 Billion\nSiriusXM reported total revenue of $1.6 billion for the third quarter of 2024, a 5% decline year-over-year. This\ndecrease was primarily driven by a smaller average base of self-pay subscribers and a $0.53 drop in average\nrevenue per user (ARPU), bringing ARPU to $15.16. The decline in ARPU resulted from a higher proportion of\nsubscribers on self-pay promotional and streaming-only plans.\nSiriusXM Gross Profit of $969 Million and Gross Margin of 60%\nTotal cost of services at SiriusXM decreased by 2% to $658 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the\ncorresponding quarter in 2023. Gross profit at SiriusXM totaled $969 million, a decrease of 7% compared to the\n2023 period, producing a gross margin of 60%, one percentage point lower than the prior year period.\nBusiness and Programming Highlights\nIn the third quarter, SiriusXM continued to innovate across its content, technology, and pricing strategies. In\npodcasting, the company kicked off its agreement with SmartLess Media and signed a new deal with Unwell, home\nof the popular “Call Her Daddy” podcast with Alex Cooper. These moves strengthen the company’s advertising\nofferings and create new, exclusive programming within its subscription service. To further enhance the podcast\nexperience, SiriusXM also rolled out in-app improvements aimed at increasing on-demand listenership.\nWith both the election cycle and football season kicking into high gear, SiriusXM expanded its political and sports\ncontent, adding high-profile sports commentators like former coaches Jimbo Fisher and Bill Belichick, along with\nnew political shows from former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and rising Gen Z voice Dylan Douglas. This diverse\nlineup appeals to a broad audience and highlights the power of live and timely audio on SiriusXM.\nDuring the third quarter, SiriusXM introduced a new seamless app download feature for in-car subscribers, enabling\nthem to easily sign in to and use the streaming app to access even more content wherever they go. The company\nalso unveiled a new approach for automakers to present SiriusXM to their customers, allowing multiple brands\nincluding Toyota to offer a three-year SiriusXM subscription with the purchase of select new vehicles, delivering\nadded value to new car dealers and buyers.\nPandora and Off-Platform Third Quarter 2024 Segment Highlights\nPandora and Off-Platform Self-Pay Subscribers of 5.9 Million\nSelf-pay subscribers of the Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium services decreased by 76,000 during the third\nquarter of 2024 to end the period at 5.9 million. The decrease was driven by a decline in trial starts and lower\nretention due to price increases on certain self-pay plans.\nPandora and Off-Platform Revenue of $544 Million\nPandora and Off-Platform revenue totaled $544 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 1%, or $6 million,\nfrom $550 million in the same period of 2023. Advertising revenue in the segment reached $409 million, reflecting a\n2% decline from the $418 million recorded in the prior year period and a 2% increase compared to the second\nquarter of 2024. Subscriber revenue reached $135 million in the 2024 third quarter, a 2% year-over-year increase.\nPandora and Off-Platform Gross Profit of $187 Million\nTotal cost of services were $357 million in the third quarter of 2024, a 4% decrease compared to $370 million in the\nsame period of 2023. This led to a gross profit of $187 million for the Pandora and Off-Platform segment in the third\nquarter of 2024, a 4% increase from the previous year, resulting in a gross margin of 34%, up by 1 percentage point\nfrom the prior year period.\nADDITIONAL FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nSubscriber acquisition costs increased to $90 million in the third quarter of 2024 up from $87 million in the\ncorresponding 2023 quarter. Sales and marketing expenses dropped 8% to $206 million, down from $224 million in\nthe same period in 2023. Engineering, design, and development costs fell 7% in the third quarter of 2024 to $57\nmillion, while general and administrative expenses decreased 5% in the quarter to $113 million. The company\nremains on track to achieve $200 million in cost savings for the full year 2024 through continued optimization and\nconsolidation efforts.\nFollowing the close of the Liberty transaction, the company revised its guidance for free cash flow to approximately\n$1 billion. This adjustment incorporates an additional $215 million in full year transaction-related cash costs, which\nincludes transaction fees, legacy Liberty Sirius XM operating and interest expenses, and post-close interest costs.\nOf this amount, approximately $180 million had been paid by September 30, 2024, with an additional $35 million\nexpected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, SiriusXM generated $93 million in free cash flow, a decline from the prior year, driven by\napproximately $72 million in Liberty Media transaction-related costs, lower cash receipts, higher programming\npayments, and higher capital expenditures. These factors were partially offset by reduced cash taxes.\n2024 FULL-YEAR FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nThe company reduced its full-year 2024 guidance for revenue, and reiterated its guidance for adjusted EBITDA, and\nfree cash flow as follows:\n• Total revenue of approximately $8.675 billion,\n• Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.7 billion, and\n• Free cash flow of approximately $1 billion.\nTHIRD QUARTER 2024 RESULTS\nSIRIUS XM HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(UNAUDITED)\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nSubscriber revenue $ 1,645 $ 1,729 $ 4,983 $ 5,146\nAdvertising revenue 450 460 1,295 1,278\nEquipment revenue 43 49 140 142\nOther revenue 33 33 93 99\nTotal revenue 2,171 2,271 6,511 6,665\nOperating expenses:\nCost of services:\nRevenue share and royalties 707 731 2,118 2,162\nProgramming and content 150 153 456 456\nCustomer service and billing 110 116 335 363\nTransmission 57 54 172 153\nCost of equipment 2 3 7 10\nSubscriber acquisition costs 90 87 272 270\nSales and marketing 217 237 675 680\nEngineering, design and development 68 72 224 234\nGeneral and administrative 138 139 378 468\nDepreciation and amortization 145 145 455 460\nImpairment, restructuring and other costs 3,388 6 3,441 56\nTotal operating expenses 5,072 1,743 8,533 5,312\n(Loss) income from operations (2,901) 528 (2,022) 1,353\nOther income (expense), net\nInterest expense (124) (134) (379) (404)\nGain on extinguishment of debt — 27 — 27\nOther income (expense), net 28 (51) 142 (17)\nTotal other expense (96) (158) (237) (394)\n(Loss) income before income taxes (2,997) 370 (2,259) 959\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 39 (79) (103) (199)\nNet (loss) income $ (2,958) $ 291 $ (2,362) $ 760\nNet (loss) income per common share:\nBasic $ (8.74) $ 0.86 $ (7.01) $ 2.24\nDiluted $ (8.74) $ 0.82 $ (7.01) $ 2.12\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding:\nBasic 339 337 337 339\nDiluted 339 360 337 360\nDividends declared per common share $ 0.266 $ 0.242 $ 0.798 $ 0.726\nSIRIUS XM HOLDINGS INC.

It also marked an\nimportant moment in the history of our Company, as we embarked on the evolutionary\njourney that is our top priority in the year ahead: building the next generation of\nSiriusXM.\nJennifer Witz\nChief Executive Officer\nIn addition, we advanced our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy.\nThis includes improving our products and services while being efficient and\nenvironmentally conscious, providing an engaging environment where our employees\ncan thrive, and serving as a platform for diverse perspectives. In 2023, we will\ncontinue to refine our ESG strategy and work, and provide updates on each of these\npriorities moving forward.\nGrowth Priorities\nWe remain committed to our three strategic priorities – to own the car, expand streaming, and maintain\nleadership in ad-supported audio. Underpinning all three of our priorities is our focus on giving listeners\nthe best experience everywhere they tune in.\nOwn the Car\nWe continue to be the leader in the car, and are constantly working to evolve our business with new\nin-vehicle features and capabilities. Our penetration rates in both new and used vehicle sales remained\nstrong, 83% and 53%, respectively, at the close of the year, with our enabled fleet now over 150 million\nvehicles. Additionally, we’ve expanded our 360L footprint, now with over seven million 360L-enabled cars\nacross 20 automotive brands following the additions of Jaguar, Land Rover, Lamborghini and Nissan\nvehicles in 2022.\n110055667799 AARR FFrroonnttIInnsseerrtt..iinndddd 11 33//2233//22002233 1100::2233::5533 AAMM\nOur easy-to-use and superior in-car user experience has always been a differentiator for SiriusXM, and it\nremains critical to our business as we look toward the exciting work to come in the year ahead. Just as cars\ntoday look radically different from how they did even just a few years ago, we are committed to driving a\nconsumer-first look and feel for our listeners that is innovative and fresh.\nExpand Streaming\nAlongside our in-car innovations, we are focused on expanding streaming – a key growth driver of our\nbusiness – with offerings built for people, not devices, and providing our subscribers with the best\nexperience everywhere they tune in. In 2023, we are laying the groundwork for the next generation of\nSiriusXM, investing in a revamped consumer experience and a new technology infrastructure. These\nsystems will be built to scale, bring further innovation to 360L, and will allow us to be more agile and\ndynamic both in and out of the car. And ultimately, they will allow us to launch a reimagined SiriusXM\nexperience in late 2023, one that takes the ease and connection we have in-car and extends it everywhere\nour subscribers go while inviting new listeners in as our standalone streaming business grows.\nAd Leadership\nThrough SXM Media, our combined advertising sales group across SiriusXM, Pandora, and podcasts, and\nour ad-tech group, AdsWizz, we are well positioned to deliver results for advertisers looking to tap into the\npower of audio. Within podcasting specifically, we are a top player, representing five of the top 20 shows in\nEdison Research’s podcast rankings, the most of any network. Additionally, in 2022 we rolled out new\naudience-based podcast products, which help to provide greater efficiency through automation – which is\nstill nascent in podcasting – and to welcome new advertisers. Across our ad platform, we realized $1.77B\nin revenue in 2022, and are excited by the ongoing growth and monetization opportunities within\npodcasting.\nAn Elite Lineup of Top Brands and On-Air Talent for All Segments\nAt our core, our value proposition to listeners remains the same: we fuel fandom, giving our listeners the\ncontent that moves them, from sports and music to talk and podcasts. Our incredible slate of talent and\nprogramming is truly unparalleled, and over the past year, has only continued to grow. We are home to the\nbiggest artists with exclusive music channels, such as Drake’s Sound 42 and Bruce Springsteen’s E Street\nRadio. Our hosts, including Howard Stern, Gayle King, Conan O’Brien, Tinx, Kevin Hart, Andy Cohen, and\n110055667799 AARR FFrroonnttIInnsseerrtt..iinndddd 22 33//2233//22002233 1100::2233::5533 AAMM\nmany more, create emotionally engaging experiences that are habit-forming for our listeners, with must-\nhear moments happening on our air every day that they can’t get anywhere else. And we offer the most\ndiverse and comprehensive line-up of exclusive sports, comedy, politics and news channels in audio.\nFor creators, we offer a unique platform to share their authentic voices and stories; for listeners, we offer\nexclusive access to the voices of their generation. Whether it’s live on our air, streaming on Pandora, on\ndemand with podcasts, or even at one of the 300+ events we produced in 2022, we are driving listening\neverywhere fans tune in, and loyalty within our subscriber base.\n2023 is a critical moment in our history, and we believe we are taking the necessary steps to future-proof\nthis organization for its next era. We continue to be focused on maintaining and building our business in\nprofitable ways. Our three growth priorities remain at the core of our strategy, and are evolving with our\nbusiness. We are doubling-down on our existing talent and programming, and are finding new ways to do\nmore with our brands. We have organized our business to become more agile and efficient to allow us to\neffectively focus all our resources toward our key priorities and goals for the year. And while we remain\ndisciplined in our spending, we are laser-focused on our vision to shape the future of audio where\neveryone is effortlessly connected to the voices, stories, and music they love.\nOn behalf of the Board, employees and talent at SiriusXM, we want to thank you for your continued support\nfor and commitment to the Company.

Any third party consultant asked to furnish an initial list will be requested to include such\ncandidates. Among the members of our board of directors, four self-identify as female, and one member\nself- identifies as African-American.\nThe Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee generally considers each nominee in the\nbroad context of the overall composition of our board of directors with a view toward constituting a board that,\nas a group, possesses the appropriate mix of skills and experience to oversee our business.

After conducting an initial evaluation of a\ncandidate, the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee will interview that candidate if it\nbelieves the candidate might be qualified to be a director and may ask the candidate to meet with other directors\nand management. If the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee believes a candidate\nwould be a valuable addition to the board of directors, it will recommend to the board that candidate’s\nnomination as a director.\nWhat is the board’s leadership structure?\nGregory B. Maffei, the Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Media Corporation, is the Chairman of our board of\ndirectors. The Chairman of our board organizes the work of the board and ensures that the board has access\nto sufficient information to enable the board to carry out its functions, including monitoring our performance\nand the performance of management. The Chairman, among other things, presides over meetings of the\nboard of directors, establishes the agenda for each meeting of the board in consultation with our Chief\nExecutive Officer, oversees the distribution of information to directors, and performs other duties or\nassignments as agreed with either the board of directors or our Chief Executive Officer. The board of directors\nhas determined that it is currently in our best interests to separate the Chairman of the board position and\n16\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 17\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nthe Chief Executive Officer position because it allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day\nbusiness, including risk management, while allowing the Chairman of the board to lead the directors and\nassist the board in its fundamental role of providing advice to, and oversight of, management. In addition, a\nseparate Chairman provides an additional resource and level of support to our Chief Executive Officer. Our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) do not establish this approach as a policy, but as a\nmatter that is considered from time-to-time.\nDoes the board have a lead independent director?\nLiberty Media beneficially owns, directly and indirectly, approximately83% of our outstanding common stock.\nIn light of that control relationship, the board of directors believes it is appropriate, and a matter of good\ncorporate governance, to designate a director to serve as the Lead Independent Director. The board has\ndesignated Eddy W. Hartenstein, the former Chairman of our board of directors, to serve as the Lead\nIndependent Director. The Lead Independent Director coordinates the activities of the other independent\ndirectors and performs such other duties and responsibilities as the board of directors determines. As the Lead\nIndependent Director, Mr. Hartenstein also chairs executive sessions of our independent directors, chairs\nmeetings of the board of directors in the absence of the Chairman, meets regularly with our Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, provides input on the design and functioning of the board of directors, and acts as the\nprincipal liaison between our Chairman and our independent directors.\nAre all of the directors required to be independent?\nLiberty Media beneficially owns, directly and indirectly, approximately83% of our outstanding common stock\nentitled to vote for the election of directors. As a result, we are considered a “controlled company” and are\naccordingly exempt from certain corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ including, among other items,\nthe requirement that our board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors, that we have a\ncompensation committee comprised of independent directors and that director nominations are recommended by\nthe independent members of the board of directors or a nominating committee composed of independent\ndirectors. We rely on these exemptions available to a controlled company with respect to the independence\nrequirements applicable to members of our compensation committee and our Nominating, Environmental, Social\nand Governance Committee.\nThe controlled company exemption does not extend to the audit committee independence requirements.\nAccordingly, our audit committee is, and will continue to be, comprised solely of directors meeting the\nindependence standards under the applicable NASDAQ listing standards, Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act\nand our Guidelines.\nHow does the board determine which directors are considered independent?\nOur board reviews the independence of our directors annually. The provisions of our Guidelinesregarding director\nindependence meet, and in some areas exceed, the listing standards of NASDAQ. A copy of our Guidelinesis\navailable on our website under “ESG– Governance– Governance Documents”.\nThe Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee undertook a review of director independence\nin March 2023. As part of this review, the Committee reviewed with our Corporate Secretary questionnaires\nsubmitted by directors. These questionnaires disclose transactions and relationships between each director or\nmembers of his or her immediate family, on one hand, and us, other directors, members of our senior\nmanagement and our affiliates, on the other hand.\n17\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 18\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nBased on this review, the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee determined that all of\nour directors and nominees are independent under the standards set forth in our Guidelinesand the applicable\nNASDAQ listing standards, with the exception of:\n• Jennifer C. Witz, our Chief Executive Officer;\n• James E. Meyer, our former Chief Executive Officer;\n• Gregory B. Maffei, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Liberty Media;\n• David A. Blau, who is an employee of Liberty Media;\n• Robin P. Hickenlooper, who is an employee of Liberty Media; and\n• Evan D. Malone, whose father is the Chairman of Liberty Media.\nIn the case of Michael Rapino, the directors evaluated the ownership relationship between Liberty Media and Live\nNation, including the fact that Mr. Maffei is the Chairman of the Board of Live Nation, and other ordinary course\ntransactions, such as data and marketing agreements, between us and Live Nation. In the case of David Zaslav, the\ndirectors evaluated ordinary course transactions, such as various content and marketing agreements, between us\nand Warner Bros. Discovery. Similarly, in the case of Jonelle Procope, the directors evaluated the ordinary course\ntransactions between us and the Apollo Theater. The board concluded that neither Mr. Rapino, Mr. Zaslav nor\nMs. Procope had any relationships that, in the opinion of the board, would interfere with the exercise of\nindependent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors.\nThe board has determined that one half of the members of the Compensation Committee meet the\nindependence standards under the applicable NASDAQ listing standards and our Guidelinesand qualify as\n“non- employee directors” for purposes of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The board has determined that\none half of the members of the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee meet the\nindependence requirements mandated by NASDAQ applicable to serving on the Nominating, Environmental,\nSocial and Governance Committee and our Guidelines.\nSome investors and proxy advisors have proxy voting policies restricting non-independent directors from serving on\na company’s Compensation Committee or the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee.\nWhile the board of directors appreciates this viewpoint, the directors believe that the insight provided by\nMs. Hickenlooper as well as Mr. Blau and Mr. Maffei and the nature of our relationship with Liberty Media makes\nMs. Hickenlooper and Mr. Blau’s service on the Compensation Committee, and Mr. Maffei’s service on the\nNominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee, appropriate and in the best interests of all\nstockholders.\nThe board has also determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially sophisticated, meet\nthe independence requirements mandated by the applicable NASDAQ listing standards, Section 10A(m)(3) of the\nExchange Act and our Guidelines. The board further determined that each member of the Audit Committee\nqualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” within the meaning of the applicable SEC regulations.\nOur independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions and such sessions are chaired by Mr. Hartenstein,\nour Lead Independent Director.\nWhat are the current standing committees of the board of directors, and who are the\nmembers of these committees?\nOur board of directors has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and\nthe Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee. From time to time, the board may also form\nad hoc committees.\nCopies of the current charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating,\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Committee are available on our website under “ESG– Governance–\nCommittee Charters”.\n18\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 19\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nThe following table shows the current members and chair of each of our standing committees and the principal\nfunctions performed by each committee:\nCommittee Functions\nAudit\nMembers: • Selects our independent registered public accounting firm\nEddy W.

Each director nominee attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the board and\nmeetings held by committees on which he or she served.\nDirectors are also encouraged to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. Ms. Witz attended our 2022 annual\nmeeting of stockholders.\nHow can stockholders communicate with the board of directors?\nStockholders may communicate directly with our board of directors, or specified individual directors, according to\nthe procedures described on our website under “ESG– Governance– Contact Our Board”.\nOur Corporate Secretary reviews all correspondence to our directors and forwards to the board a summary and/or\ncopies of any such correspondence that, in the opinion of the Corporate Secretary, deals with the functions of the\nboard or committees thereof or that he otherwise determines requires their attention. Directors may at any time\nreview all correspondence received by us that is addressed to members of our board.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has established procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment, on a\nconfidential basis, of complaints received by us, our board of directors and the Audit Committee regarding\naccounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and the confidential, anonymous submissions by\nemployees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. These procedures are available\nupon written request to our Corporate Secretary.\nDirector Compensation\nPursuant to our director compensation program, in 2022, as Chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Maffei\nreceived an annual cash retainer of $150,000. Mr. Hartenstein, our Lead Independent Director, also received an\nannual cash retainer of $150,000. The other non-employee members of our board of directors each received an\nannual cash retainer of $100,000.\nEach director who served as chair of a committee of the board of directors in 2022 received an additional annual\ncash retainer as follows: the Audit Committee chairwoman received $30,000; the Compensation Committee\nchairman received $20,000; and the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee chairwoman\nreceived $15,000.\nIn addition, on an annual basis, each member receives approximately $175,000 in the form of restricted stock\nunits (“RSUs”). These RSUs were granted on the business day following our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese RSUs granted to our directors vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant.\nIn 2022, Eddy W, Hartenstein and James P. Holden each received $80,000 in cash for their service as members of\nthe Special Committee. Messrs. Hartenstein and Holden are each expected to receive $20,000 per quarter in 2023\nfor their service as members of the Special Committee.\nMr. Meyer retired as our Chief Executive Officer on December 31, 2020. Upon his retirement, we entered into a\nthree-year consulting agreement with Mr. Meyer pursuant to which he is paid a fee of $3,200,000 per year.\nMr. Meyer is also entitled to the compensation paid to other members of the board of directors. As our Chief\nExecutive Officer, Ms. Witz does not receive additional compensation for her service on the board.\n20\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 21\nITEM 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nEach director is expected to own shares of our common stock equal in value to at least five times the annual cash\nretainer payable to the director. All directors have until the later of: (i) five years from the date the director is\nelected or appointed as a member of the Board and (ii) September 1, 2023, to reach these minimum ownership\nguidelines.\nDirectors may defer their annual cash retainer each year under the Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Deferred Compensation\nPlan. Participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan, and to what extent, is at each director’s discretion and there\nis no matching contribution from us. In 2022, Mr. Maffei participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan. At the\ntime of making a deferral election, directors designate the time and form of the distribution of deferrals to be made\nfor the year to which that election relates. Distributions may occur earlier upon a change in control or a termination\nas a director, subject to certain conditions provided for under the Deferred Compensation Plan and Section 409A of\nthe Internal Revenue Code. Directors have the opportunity to designate the investment funds to which the deferred\namounts are credited. All investment gains and losses in a director’s account under the Deferred Compensation Plan\nare entirely based upon the investment selections made by the director. We have established a grantor (or “rabbi”)\ntrust to facilitate payment of our obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan.\nDividend equivalent units are granted to directors if, on any date while RSUs they hold are outstanding, we pay a\ndividend on our common stock (other than a dividend payable in common stock). The number of RSUs granted to\nthe director are, as of the record date for such dividend payment, increased by a number of RSUs equal to: (a) the\nproduct of (x) the number of RSUs held by the director as of such record date, multiplied by (y) the per share\namount of any cash dividend (or, in the case of any dividend payable, in whole or in part, other than in cash, the\nper share value of such dividend, as determined in good faith by us), divided by (b) the average closing price of a\nshare of our common stock on NASDAQ on the twenty trading days preceding, but not including, such record\ndate.

This includes oversight of our policies, practices and reporting with respect to significant ESG\nmatters, including matters relating to:\n• assessing and managing the impacts of our business activities on the environment and compliance with\nenvironmental laws and regulations;\n• our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) related to our employees and with respect to the content\nwe produce and distribute on our platforms; and\n• governance practices aimed at ensuring objective oversight of our business activities.\nThe Committee fulfills these responsibilities in consultation and coordination with other committees of the board\nof directors as well as with the full board.\nIn 2021, we engaged an independent advisory firm that advises public companies on corporate governance and\nESG strategy to assist us, the Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee and our board of\ndirectors in developing and executing our ESG strategy. In 2021, we conducted a materiality assessment of\nrelevant ESG risks and opportunities; identified areas of focus for our company; evaluated the ESG practices of\ncertain peer companies; and began the process of developing ESG policies and practices to address the\nexpectations of investors and our stakeholders. In 2022, we compiled information regarding our ESG efforts and\npublished them on our website, including a discussion of our environmental impact and greenhouse gas (“GHG”)\nemissions, a review of our social responsibility and DE&I practices, and our governance practices (including a library\nthat includes ESG-related policies).\nESG Areas of Focus\nOur 2021 materiality assessment identified the ESG issues that we believe are most relevant to our company and\nstakeholders, and the pillars upon which we expected to base our ESG strategy. A summary of those pillars is\nincluded below:\nEfficiency and Environmental\nResponsibility Talent & Engagement Platform for Diverse Perspectives\nWe seek to improve our Our diverse talent drives what We aim to be a platform for\nproducts and services for our we do, and we strive to provide diverse perspectives and\ncustomers while being efficient an engaging environment where facilitate dialogue on all issues,\nand conscious of the environment. each person can thrive. big and small.\nIn 2022, we refined our ESG strategy, practices and disclosures, and in 2023, we anticipate that we will be able to\nprovide investors and other stakeholders with updates on our activities on our website.\n23\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 24\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS\nEnvironmental\nIn 2022, we licensed a system that assists us in the compiling of data related to the consumption of energy across our\nbusiness activities. This allows us to estimate the amount of GHG emissions generated by our consumption of energy. In\n2021, electricity consumption at our office locations, data centers, and repeater networks generated the vast majority of\nour GHG emissions, all of which constituted Scope 2 GHG emissions (i.e., emissions that we may cause indirectly when\nthe energy we purchase and useis produced). A relatively small amount of our energy consumption in 2021 was related\nto heating our locations and fueling our small fleet of vehicles (most of which are used for testing our satellite radio\nservice and our connected vehicle services), which constitutes Scope 1 GHG emissions.\nDuring 2023, we intend to update our website to disclose our 2022 GHG emission data once we have completed\nthe process of compiling that data. In 2023, we also intend to begin analyzing our Scope 3 GHG emissions (i.e.,\nemissions that are not produced by us, and not the result of activities from assets owned or controlled by us, but\nemissions that we may be indirectly responsible for) to determine the materiality of those emissions on our business\nand provide estimates of our most significant categories of Scope 3 emissions. Wealso intend to monitor and\nanalyze our business activities to evaluate opportunities to reduce and potentially mitigate our carbon footprint over\ntime, including making certain tax equity investments in clean energy technologies, as we have made in the past.\nSocial\nOur Workforce\nWe believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. We cultivate an inclusive environment where human\ndifferences are valued, respected, supported and amplified. We have taken actions to recruit, retain, develop and\nadvance a diverse and talented workforce. Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are led by our Senior Vice\nPresident, Head of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. This position regularly reports to our Chief Executive Officer, works\nwith our executive officers and provides updates to our board of directors.\nWe are focused on increasing the representation of women and people of color at all levels of our organization.\nWe recruit talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a sponsor of professional conferences focused\non diverse talent. We have created a program, called Pathways, that provides recent graduates of Historically Black\nColleges and Universities with entry-level full-time opportunities. We also have agreements with third parties\ndesigned to offer leadership development for Black, Latinx, Native American and Asian employees. Additionally,\nwe provide a mentoring program to help underrepresented employees benefit from coaching, guidance, and\nfeedback. We have five employee resource groups supporting women, people of color, veterans, the LGBTQIA+\ncommunity and employees with disabilities.\nIn an effort to assess, evaluate and further our DE&I efforts, we periodically ask our employees to provide\nvoluntary demographic information related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, veteran\nand disability status. We also comply with the FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules, including\nmaking the EEO reports we file with the FCC publicly available.\nTo attract and retain talent, we also recognize the need to create a supportive workplace, with opportunities for\nour employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health\nand wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.\nFor more information on our related practices and programs, please see the disclosure in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the caption “Human Capital Resources.”\nOur Workplace\nIn addition to cultivating a diverse and inclusive environment, we believe it is important to ensure that policies,\nprocesses and practices are administered fairly and equitably for all employees. We have implemented a broad set\nof anti-harassment and discrimination policies designed to protect against discrimination based upon sex, gender,\nrace, color, religion/religious creed, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, age,\nmarital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, sex stereotype, transgender,\nimmigration status, military and protected veteran status, medical condition, or any basis prohibited under federal,\nstate or local law. We also provide regular training and guidance to our workforce regarding diversity, equity and\n24\n2023 PROXY STATEMENT\n105679_01_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:12 AM Page 25\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS\ninclusion. In 2021, we launched “Can We Talk?” an initiative aimed at increasing cultural awareness and\npromoting dialogue and “Conscious Inclusion,” a facilitator-led training required for all of our full-time U.S. based\nemployees. Conscious Inclusion is designed to promote inclusive behaviors in our workplace by enabling\nemployees to explore bias and its impact and to learn how it translates to reactions and behaviors towards\ndifferences. We have integrated diversity, equity and inclusion messaging into our regular meetings between our\nChief Executive Officer and our workforce.\nServing as a Platform for Diverse Perspectives\nWe offer audio platforms where listeners have access to diverse programming that represents a wide range of\nbackgrounds, lifestyles, opinions and viewpoints. We are committed to respecting creator expression and honoring\nlistener preferences while facilitating dialogue on all issues, big and small. We support freedom of speech and\nexpression whether it be in talk, comedy, entertainment, sports, music or commentary of any kind.\nCollectively, our programming is designed to broaden the listening experience for individuals, regardless of their views,\nand so we will continue to offer content across the entire spectrum of viewpoints and entertainment offerings.\nOn programming and content that some may deem controversial, we come down on the side of allowing the\nvoices in a debate, or the message from an artist or performer, to speak for itself rather than acting to censure or\ncancel. As supporters of free speech and expression, our philosophy is to be extraordinarily cautious before\nremoving content.\nCorporate Giving & Volunteering\nOur corporate giving and volunteering programs encourage employees to give to the causes most meaningful to\nthem. We have a charitable match program which offers employees a dollar-for-dollar match on their charitable\ncontributions up to a specific cap. In addition, full-time employees are eligible to receive five days of paid time off\nto volunteer with charitable organizations of their choice.

In 2022, we announced a new set of core values to our\nworkforce: “We believe we will shape the future of audio because we are: authentic, inclusive, curious and driven”.\nWe intend to employ these core values to inform and guide the decisions and behaviors of our employees.\nWe operate a performance-based environment where results matter and financial discipline is enforced. We\nhave a highly collaborative culture in which employees feel a sense of pride that their input is sought after and\nvalued. At the same time, we believe in holding individuals accountable for results and employees are\nempowered and expected to “do what they say they are going to do.” We believe that our culture is a\nlong- term competitive advantage for us, fuels our ability to execute and is a critical underpinning of our\nemployee talent strategy.\nWhat is SiriusXM’s process for succession planning and talent management?\nEnsuring that we have the appropriate senior management talent to successfully pursue our strategies is one of\nour board’s primary responsibilities. At least once a year, the board of directors discusses succession planning for\nour Chief Executive Officer and the remainder of our executive officers and senior executives. To help fulfill the\nboard’s responsibility, our Compensation Committee helps ensure that we have in place appropriate plans to\naddress CEO succession both in the ordinary course of business and in emergency situations. Our CEO succession\nplanning includes criteria that reflect our business strategies, such as identifying and developing internal\ncandidates. Our Guidelinesalso require that we have appropriate succession planning for the remainder of our\nseniormanagement team, including our named executive officers.\nRecruiting, developing, promoting and retaining top talent is a key priority for our company. Throughout the year,\nour executive officers, as well as a broader array of executives throughout our company, make presentations to the\nboard of directors and may also interact with our directors informally outside of our scheduled Board meetings. This\nengagement between directors and our current and future leaders is one means by which we provide our directors\ninsight into our current pool of talent, what attracts and retains oursenior management, and our corporate culture.\nHow does the board of directors and the Audit Committee oversee cybersecurity risks?\nOur chief information officer and our chief information security officer regularly make presentations regarding\ncybersecurity, including updates regarding cybersecurity concerns and our approach to managing cybersecurity\nrisks, to the Audit Committee, which is tasked with primary oversight of certain risk issues, including cybersecurity.\nIn order to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyberattacks, we have developed a program, overseen\nby our chief information security officer and our information security council, that is designed to protect and\npreserve the confidentiality, integrity and continued availability of information owned by, or in the care of, our\ncompany. As part of this program, we conduct periodic “war games” and “desktop exercises” to simulate security\nbreaches and cyberattacks and prepare our response teams. This program also includes a cyber incident response\nplan that is intended to provide controls and procedures for timely and accurate reporting of any material\ncybersecurity incident.The Audit Committee regularly briefs our board of directors on these matters.\n28\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 29\nGovernAnCe of THe CoMpAny\nHow does the board of directors oversee our risk management process?\nThe board executes its oversight responsibility for risk management directly and through its committees, as\nfollows:\n• The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for monitoring our internal audit, corporate, financial and risk\nmanagement processes and overseeing our system of internal controls and financial reporting. The Audit\nCommittee discusses specific risk areas throughout the year, including those that may arise from time to time\nand the measures taken by management to monitor and limit risks.\n• The Audit Committee receives regular reports throughout the year on matters related to risk management. At\neach regularly scheduled meeting, the Audit Committee receives reports from (i) our external auditor on the\nstatus of audit activities and findings and (ii) the Company executive in charge of internal audit (who reports\ndirectly to the Audit Committee) on the status of our internal audit plan, audit results and any corrective action\ntaken in response to internal audit findings.\n• We have a Compliance Officer who is in charge of our compliance with FCC related laws and regulations and\ntraining and monitoring compliance with those laws and regulations. Our Executive Vice President, General\nCounsel and Secretary reports to the Audit Committee throughout the year on information received via\nsubmissions to our compliance hotline and any changes or developments in compliance matters. Each quarter,\nour Chief Financial Officer reports to the board of directors on our performance and discusses how actual\nperformance compares to our business plan and budget. Our executive officers report regularly to the board\nabout the risks and exposures related to our business.\n• The Audit Committee, which is generally responsible for risk oversight, is regularly updated by our Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding enterprise risk management efforts, including\ncybersecurity concerns and our approach to managing cybersecurity risks. Our chief information officer and\nchief information security officer also regularly make presentations to the Audit Committee regarding\ncybersecurity.\n• The Nominating, Environmental, Social and Governance Committee reviews and oversees, among other things,\nour policies, practices and positions to further our corporate citizenship and sustainability, including matters\nrelating to environmental quality, corporate social responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and other\nenvironmental, social and governance matters.\n• The other committees of the board of directors oversee risks associated with their respective areas of\nresponsibility. For example, the Compensation Committee assesses risks associated with management\nsuccession planning and our compensation policies and programs for executives as well as the broader\nemployee base.\n• The committees report to the board of directors at every regular board meeting on the topics discussed and\nactions taken at the most recent committee meeting. Our board of directors discusses the risks and exposures,\nif any, involved in the matters or recommendations of the committees, as necessary.\n• Our board of directors also considers specific risk topics throughout the year, including risks associated with our\nbusiness plan, litigation, operational efficiency, government regulation, physical facilities, information\ntechnology infrastructure, cybersecurity and capital structure. The board is informed about and regularly\ndiscusses our risk profile, including legal, regulatory and operational risks to our business.\nIn administering its risk oversight function, the board attempts to discuss, evaluate and asses various risks based\non the immediacy of the risks, including whether the matters can properly be classified as short-term,\nintermediate- term or long-term, and then discuss the nature and extent of the risk in the context of the time\nhorizon for the associated risk. In assessing risks, the board of directors has in the past and may in the future\nconsult with outside advisors and experts, such as experts in cybersecurity, to help it assess and, to the extent\npossible, anticipate future threats and trends.\n29\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 30\nGovernAnCe of THe CoMpAny\nOn an annual basis, and more often as the facts and circumstances warrant, our Senior Vice President, Internal\nAudit, leads a process with our senior management to identify, assess and evaluate our enterprise-wide risks. As\nnoted above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regularly update the Audit Committee\nregarding our enterprise risk management efforts, including significant emerging risks identified by our Senior\nVice President, Internal Audit. Our risk oversight efforts are an integrated part of our financial reporting and\ndisclosure controls process. Enterprise risks, including emerging items, are discussed are part our corporate\ncontrols in preparing our SEC and other public filings.\nWhat are our policies and procedures for related person transactions?\nWe have adopted a written policy and written procedures for the review, approval and monitoring of transactions\ninvolving the Company or its subsidiaries and “related persons.” For the purposes of the policy, “related persons”\ninclude executive officers, directors or their immediate family members, or stockholders owning more than\nfive percent of our common stock.\nOur related person transaction policy requires:\n• that any transaction in which the Company is a participant, a related person has a material direct or indirect\ninterest and which exceeds $120,000 (such transaction referred to as a “related person” transaction) and any\nmaterial amendment or modification to a related person transaction, be reviewed and approved or ratified by a\ncommittee of the board composed solely of independent directors who are disinterested; and\n• that any employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer and the Company must be\napproved by the Compensation Committee or recommended by the Compensation Committee to the board of\ndirectors for its approval.\nIn connection with the review and approval or ratification of a related person transaction, management must:\n• disclose to the committee or independent directors, as applicable, the material terms of the related person\ntransaction, including the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the transaction, and all the\nmaterial facts as to the related person’s direct or indirect interest in, or relationship to, the related person\ntransaction;\n• advise the committee or independent directors, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction\ncomplies with the terms of our agreements governing our material outstanding indebtedness that limit or\nrestrict our ability to enter into a related person transaction;\n• advise the committee or independent directors, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction will\nbe required to be disclosed in our SEC filings. To the extent required to be disclosed, management must ensure\nthat the related person transaction is disclosed in accordance with SEC rules; and\n• advise the committee or independent directors, as applicable, as to whether the related person transaction\nconstitutes a “personal loan” for purposes of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIn addition, the related person transaction policy provides that the Nominating, Environmental, Social and\nGovernance Committee, in connection with any approval or ratification of a related person transaction involving a\nnon-employee director or director nominee, should consider whether such transaction would compromise the\ndirector or director nominee’s status as an “independent” or “outside” director, as applicable, under the rules and\nregulations of the SEC and NASDAQ.\nWe have entered into several agreements with the Apollo Theater in the ordinary course of business, including\nagreements to hold certain live subscriber events.

Mr. Meyer, our Vice Chairman, owns an approximately 28% interest in Meyer Shank Racing, Inc.,\nwhile Liberty Media owns an approximately 30% interest in Meyer Shank Racing, Inc. Our board of directors has\nreviewed our agreements and relationship with Meyer Shank Racing and all of our agreements with Meyer Shank\nRacing have been approved by the Audit Committee. In 2021, we renewed our racing team sponsorship for the\n2022 and 2023 racing seasons. In 2022, we spent approximately $4.5 million in connection with this sponsorship\nand in 2023 and 2024, we expect to spend approximately $3.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively.\nOn February 1, 2021, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Media governing the allocation of\nconsolidated U.S. income tax liabilities and setting forth agreements with respect to other tax matters. The tax\nsharing agreement was negotiated and approved by the Special Committee of our board of directors, each of\nwhom is independent of Liberty Media.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code, two corporations may form a consolidated tax group, and file a consolidated\nfederal income tax return, if one corporation owns stock representing at least 80% of the voting power and value\nof the outstanding capital stock of the other corporation. The tax sharing agreement governs certain matters\nrelated to the resulting consolidated federal income tax returns, as well as state and local returns filed on a\nconsolidated or combined basis.\nOn November 1, 2021, Liberty Media entered into an Exchange Agreement with certain counterparties to acquire\nan aggregate of 43,658,800 shares of our common stock in exchange for the issuance by Liberty Media to the\nholders of an aggregate of 5,347,320 shares of Liberty’s Series A Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock, par value\n$0.01 per share, in a transaction intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section\n368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The transactions under the Exchange Agreement\nclosed on November 3, 2021 and, as a result, we became members of the same consolidated tax group with\nLiberty Media. As of March 31, 2023, Liberty Media beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately83%\nof the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAlso on November 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Liberty Media, whereby Liberty Media agreed not\nto effect any merger with us pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware\n(or any successor to such statute) without obtaining the prior approval of the Special Committee of our board of\ndirectors (or any successor Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors) as well as an agreement\nregarding certain tax matters relating to the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, including the adoption\nof the Exchange Agreement as a “plan of reorganization.” Each of these agreements between us and Liberty\nMedia was negotiated by Liberty Media with the Special Committee of our board of directors.\nWhat is the relationship between SiriusXM and Liberty Media Corporation?\nIn February and March 2009, we entered into several transactions to borrow up to $530 million from Liberty\nMedia Corporation and its affiliates. All of these loans were repaid in cash in 2009.\nAs part of the transactions with Liberty Media, in February 2009, we entered into an investment agreement (the\n“Investment Agreement”) with Liberty Radio, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Media. Pursuant\nto the Investment Agreement, we issued to Liberty Radio, LLC 12,500,000 shares of convertible preferred stock in\npartial consideration for the loan investments. The preferred stock was convertible into approximately 40% of our\noutstanding shares of common stock (after giving effect to such conversion).\n31\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 32\nGovernAnCe of THe CoMpAny\nIn September 2012, Liberty Radio, LLC converted 6,249,900 shares of its preferred stock into 1,293,467,684\nshares of our common stock. In January 2013, the Federal Communications Commission granted Liberty Media\napproval to acquire control of us, and Liberty Radio, LLC converted its remaining preferred stock into an additional\n1,293,509,076 shares of our common stock. As a result of these conversions of preferred stock and additional\npurchases of our common stock, Liberty Media then beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, over 50% of our\noutstanding common stock.\nFour individuals who are affiliated with Liberty Media, either as executives or members of the board of directors of\nLiberty Media, are members of our board of directors. Gregory B. Maffei, the President and Chief Executive Officer\nof Liberty Media, is the Chairman of our board of directors.\nAs a result, Liberty Media has the ability to control our affairs, policies and operations, such as the appointment of\nmanagement, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends on our\ncommon stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and the\nentering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of\nother stockholders. In addition, Liberty Media can determine the outcome of all matters requiring general\nstockholder approval and has the ability to cause or prevent a change of control of our Company or a change in\nthe composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our Company. The\nconcentration of ownership could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common\nstock as part of a sale of our Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nDoes SiriusXM have corporate governance guidelines and a code of ethics?\nOur board of directors adopted our Guidelineswhich set forth a flexible framework within which the board,\nassisted by its committees, directs our affairs. Our Guidelinescover, among other things, the composition and\nfunctions of our board of directors, director independence, management succession and review, committee\nassignments and selection of new members of our board of directors.\nOur board of directors has also adopted a Code of Ethics, which is applicable to all our directors and employees,\nincluding our chief executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.\nOur Guidelinesand the Code of Ethicsare available on our website under “ESG– Governance– Governance\nDocuments” and in print to any stockholder who provides a written request for either document to our Corporate\nSecretary.

We refer to these five officers\nthroughout this CD&A and the accompanying tables as our “named executive officers.” On April 3, 2023, Sean S.\nSullivan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, informed us that he was resigning from his role,\neffective April 28, 2023. In connection with Mr. Sullivan’s departure, we appointed Thomas D. Barry as Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer, effective as of April 28, 2023.\nexeCUtIVe SUmmary\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for developing and maintaining a compensation program for our senior\nmanagement, including our named executive officers. The Committee operates pursuant to a written charter, a copy\nof which is posted to the investor relations section of our corporate website under “ESG– Governance– Committee\nCharters”. The goal of our compensation programs is to provide competitive compensation packages that (1) help\nensure we attract and retain the high caliber executives we need to achieve our business strategy and financial goals,\n(2) deliver positive returns to our stockholders over the long-term and (3) compensate our executives in a way that is\ncommensurate with their responsibilities and appropriately encourages and rewards their performance. To achieve\nthis, the Compensation Committee designs our compensation packages in order to reward (i) Company\nperformance as measured by strategic, operating and financial results, (ii) individual contributions to those results and\nthe organization as a whole, and (iii) stock price growth on an absolute and a relative basis. The Compensation\nCommittee seeks to ensure that a large portion of our named executive officers’ compensation is performance-based\nand/or equity-linked rather than fixed, and awards are balanced between short-term and long-term compensation to\nincentivize our executives to achieve strong operating and financial results, while achieving long-term strategic\nobjectives. The Compensation Committee believes that our ability to attract and retain talented and experienced\nindividuals to think strategically and execute the Company’s business objectives is essential to our long-term success,\nparticularly in light of the competitive, regulatory and technological environments in which we operate.\nThe Compensation Committee continues to believe that it is important to remain flexible in terms of senior\nmanagement compensation and that our interests—and the interests of our stockholders—are best served by regular\nevaluations of our compensation structure and maintaining flexibility to individually tailor appropriate compensation\narrangements for our senior management. Regular evaluations ensure that our compensation programs do not\ninclude inadvertent incentives for our named executive officers to take inappropriate business risks by making\ndecisions that may serve their individual interests but are not in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly,\nthe Compensation Committee discusses and evaluates our compensation program regularly, particularly the\nequity- based components of our compensation program, and periodically receives information regarding our\ncompensation program’s design, bonus targets and equity grant guidelines. The Compensation Committee may\nmodify its practices, including with respect to the mix of equity-based components that are included in our\ncompensation program, to respond to evolving compensation trends and other events in order to further strengthen\nthe link between executive and stockholder interests, and to further support our business goals and strategies.\n33\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 34\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nThe Compensation Committee believes that the diversity of our businesses, overlaid with the impact of potential\ncyclical factors, including macroeconomic and social factors (such as the disruption in the global supply chain for\nparts and components relevant to our business) affecting the sales of vehicles in the United States and the audio\nadvertising market, can make financial goal-setting a challenge for us, both on a short-term and long-term basis. The\nwork that our named executive officers must do to successfully operate our businesses, including working\nconstructively, proactively and cohesively together while remaining true to our core values and fostering a culture that\nvalues diversity, inclusion, integrity and respect, does not at all times readily lend itself to formulaic measurements,\nand a proper assessment requires the use of business judgment. The Compensation Committee also recognizes the\nimportance of identifying specific financial or operating metrics against which executive performance should be\nmeasured, and has endeavored to evolve our long-term incentive program to include goals that are both tied to\noperational performance and stock price. Specifically, the Compensation Committee has introduced a relative total\nstockholder return factor as part of its equity award grants. The Compensation Committee believes that the\ncompensation of our named executive officers is commensurate with the size of our operations, the significant scope\nof their roles and responsibilities, and their strong values-driven leadership.\nDo’s and Don’ts of Executive Compensation\n˛Grant performance-based restricted stock units to ensure that a large\nportion of executive pay is tied to performance, including use of a\nrelative total stockholder return as a performance metric\n˛Include clawback provisions in our executive employment agreements\n˛Provide reasonable post-employment and change in control protections\nWhat We Do\n˛Include a “double-trigger” change in control provision in our Sirius XM\nHoldings Inc. 2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”)\n˛Prohibit short sales, transactions in derivatives and other hedging\nactivities of our common stock by employees\n˛Use an independent compensation consultant to advise the\nCompensation Committee\n˝ Include golden parachute excise tax gross-ups in employment\nagreements\n˝ Reprice underwater stock options without stockholder approval or\ngrant stock options with an exercise price less than the fair market\nvalue of our common stock on the grant date\nWhat We Don’t Do\n˝ Provide excessive perquisites or tax gross-ups on any perquisites\n˝ Offer defined benefit pension plans or supplemental executive\nretirement plans; instead, we offer a deferred compensation plan as\nan additional retirement vehicle for executives\n˝ Provide special change in control benefits to executives\n34\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 35\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nSay-on-Pay Vote\nAt our annual meeting of stockholders in 2020, we held an advisory “say on pay” vote on the compensation of\nour named executive officers as required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act. At that meeting, our\nstockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately\n98% of our common stock that voted casting votes in favor of our say-on-pay resolution. The Compensation\nCommittee considered the strong support that our stockholders expressed for our overall compensation programs\nand philosophy and determined that our programs continue to provide a competitive pay-for-performance\npackage that effectively aligns the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders.\nAccordingly, the Compensation Committee has not made any significant changes to the core elements of our\ncompensation programs as a result of that vote. In addition, during our ordinary course engagements with\ninvestors over the past year, we have not received feedback seeking changes to these core elements.\nThe board previously adopted a policy of holding “say-on-pay” votes every three years. The Compensation\nCommittee believes that a three-year period between “say-on-pay” votes is reasonable as it allows stockholders\nsufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation strategies. Although the\nCompensation Committee will continue to monitor the frequency of “say-on-pay” votes, the Compensation\nCommittee considers a triennial vote to be the appropriate frequency to provide time to thoughtfully consider and\nimplement changes to our executive compensation program.\n2022 Business Highlights\nThis past year, our executive team continued to navigate a complex macroeconomic environment and the\ncontinued disruption in the global supply chain for parts and components relevant to our business. Our results are\na testament to the resiliency of our business, the strength of our audio entertainment product, the loyalty and\ntrust of our customers and the successful execution by our management.

However, from time to\ntime, the Compensation Committee finds it useful to look at compensation levels at various other companies in\nevaluating whether our compensation program, both as a whole and with respect to individual compensation\nelements, is reasonable and within a competitive range in order to more effectively attract and retain key executive\ntalent in a highly competitive market.\nIn making decisions with respect to a named executive officer’s compensation, the Compensation Committee\ntakes a holistic approach and, in addition to the above, considers several factors, including but not limited to:\n• the officer’s individual performance, level of responsibility, expertise and experience;\n• our recent performance;\n• whether a pay package for a specific named executive officer is aligned internally with the compensation levels\nof comparable executives within our organization;\n• management development and succession planning activities;\n• the size and mix of each element that forms the total compensation that may be awarded to the officer,\nincluding salary, bonus and long-term incentives; and\n• other compensation and benefits, including compensation payable to an officer under the officer’s employment\nagreement upon a termination of employment.\nIn addition, the work that our officers must do to successfully run our business in a highly competitive\nenvironment, while remaining committed to our culture and values, does not always readily lend itself to formulaic\nmeasurements, and a proper assessment may at times require the Compensation Committee to use its business\njudgment. The Compensation Committee does not consider past wealth accumulation in connection with its\ncompensation decisions. Depending on the performance of our Company and the individual officer’s\nperformance, as well as the various factors discussed above, the total compensation of our named executive\nofficers may be within, below or above the market range for their positions. Each named executive officer is\nemployed pursuant to agreements described under “Potential Payments or Benefits Upon Termination or Change\nin Control-Employment Agreements” below.\nRole of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation\nIn determining 2022 compensation levels, including the size and potential award opportunity of equity-based\nawards, if any, for each named executive officer (other than the Chief Executive Officer), the Compensation\nCommittee also consulted with and considered the recommendations and input of Ms. Witz, our Chief Executive\nOfficer. Ms. Witz’s recommendations were based, in part, on her assessment of the executive’s annual and long-\nterm performance, as well as our Company-wide performance, including that of the business area that the\nexecutive leads. Ms. Witz did not provide input on her individual compensation levels.\n39\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 40\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nRole of Outside Consultant\nDuring 2022, the Compensation Committee continued to engage Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC (“Semler\nBrossy”) as an outside, independent compensation consultant to assist with the evaluation of our compensation\nfor senior management. The Compensation Committee considered input from Semler Brossy as one factor in\nmaking decisions on compensation matters, along with input it receives from management, where appropriate,\nand its own judgment and experience. The Compensation Committee determined that Semler Brossy was\nindependent (taking into consideration the six factors established by NASDAQ) and evaluated whether any of the\nwork provided by Semler Brossy during 2022 raised any conflict of interest, and determined that it did not.\nOther Considerations in Determining Executive Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee believes that it should retain discretion to adjust the compensation of a named\nexecutive officer from time to time to reward performance, to reflect the assumption of additional responsibilities,\nthe occurrence of unanticipated circumstances, and in connection with the negotiation of new employment\nagreements or the renewal of employment agreements.\neaCH eLement oF oUr exeCUtIVe ComPenSatIon ProGram anD HoW It WorKS\nOur practices with respect to the key compensation elements (base salary, annual bonus, and long-term\nincentives), as well as other elements of compensation, are described below, followed by a discussion of the\nspecific factors considered in determining the levels of these compensation elements for the named executive\nofficers for 2022.\nBase Salary\nBase salaries for the named executive officers are determined in accordance with the terms of their respective\nemployment agreements. An executive’s base salary may also be increased as part of the Compensation\nCommittee’s annual review of executive base salaries or at other times if the Compensation Committee\ndetermines that an adjustment is warranted to more appropriately compensate the executive for the executive’s\nday-to-day duties or due to pay levels for comparable positions in the market for executive talent. The base\nsalaries set forth in the employment agreements and any increases over these amounts are determined by the\nCompensation Committee based on a variety of factors, including:\n• The nature and responsibility of the executive’s position and, to the\nextent available and deemed relevant, salary trends for persons in\nsimilar positions at comparable companies\n• The expertise, demonstrated leadership, scope of responsibilities and\nFactors Affecting\njob performance of the executive\nBase Salary\n• The executive’s total compensation, including other cash bonus\nConsiderations\nawards and equity-based awards\n• The competitiveness of the market for the executive’s services\n• The desire to maintain internal pay equity among our executives with\nrespect to base salaries\n40\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 41\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nThe Compensation Committee does not apply specific weighting to any one factor in setting an executive officer’s\nbase salary, and also considers the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer (except as to her own\ncompensation) when determining base salary amounts. The Compensation Committee believes that a competitive\nbase salary is an important component of compensation by providing financial stability for the named executive\nofficers while helping to attract and retain executive talent. In setting base salaries, the Compensation Committee\nalso believes that, in order to better align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders, the\namount of base salary should be a relatively smaller portion of each named executive officer’s overall\ncompensation package as compared to the executive’s annual bonus and equity-based compensation. Typically,\nafter establishing a named executive’s officer base salary, salary increases are limited to cost-of-living adjustments,\nadjustments based on changes in the scope of the named executive officer’s responsibilities, and adjustments to\nalign the named executive officer’s salary level with those of our other named executive officers.\nAnnual Incentives\n• In considering annual bonuses, the Compensation Committee takes\ninto consideration the key financial and operating metrics selected by\nthe Compensation Committee\nAnnual • The Compensation Committee has historically awarded annual\nIncentives— bonuses in cash\nAnnual Bonus • None of our named executive officers are entitled to a guaranteed or\nminimum annual bonus\n• Annual bonuses approved by the Compensation Committee for 2022\nwere intended to link compensation with corporate performance\nIn 2022, the Compensation Committee assessed our performance using various criteria which we publicly report,\nsuch as net self-pay subscriber additions, advertising revenue, total revenue and adjusted EBITDA. A description of\nthe methodologies used by the Compensation Committee to determine the annual bonuses, and the amount\nof the bonuses to our named executive officers, is discussed below under the heading “Fiscal Year 2022 Pay\nResults—Payment of Performance-Based Discretionary Annual Bonuses for 2022” and are reflected in the\n“Bonus” column of the 2022 Summary Compensation Table.\nLong-term Equity-Based Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee determines the level of long-term incentive compensation in conjunction with its\nreview and approval of the total compensation to be provided to named executive officers and the objectives of\nour overall executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee’s policy is generally to determine if\nany equity awards should be granted to the named executive officers at the time they enter into or renew their\nemployment agreements and revisit the analysis as part of its annual review of executive compensation, with\ngrants, if any, taking place during periods in which employees are permitted to trade in our common stock. Equity\nawards made by the Compensation Committee are in some cases intended to cover multiple years and, in other\ncircumstances, are made as an annual grant depending on individual circumstances.\nWhy Long-Term Incentives Are a Key Aspect of Our Executive Compensation Program\nLong-term incentive awards have historically represented a significant portion of our named executive\nofficers’ total compensation opportunity. These awards are delivered through equity-based compensation\nthat generally vest over a multi-year period to provide the named executive officers with a continuing stake\nin our success, align their interests with those of our stockholders, inspire dynamic leadership, reward\nactions that create sustainable stockholder value, and support our talent retention objectives through\nextended vesting requirements and forfeiture provisions.\n41\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 42\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nIn recent years, the Compensation Committee adopted guidelines that the long-term equity compensation for our\nsenior management should generally consisted of 25% stock options, 25% restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and\n50% performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), subject to the discretion of the Compensation\nCommittee in individual cases. The guidelines provide that stock option and RSU awards generally vest in\ninstallments on the anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the executive’s continued employment with the\nCompany on the applicable vesting dates. The PRSU awards generally cliff vest, subject to the Company’s level of\nachievement of one or more financial and/or operating goals, or combination of goals, for a performance period\nset by the Compensation Committee. These performance metrics may include, among other things, return on net\nassets, return on stockholders’ equity, return on assets, return on capital, revenue, average revenue per subscriber,\ntotal stockholder returns, profit margin, earnings per share, free cash flow per share, net earnings, operating\nearnings, free cash flow, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, number of subscribers, growth of subscribers, operating expenses,\ncapital expenses, subscriber acquisition costs or other metrics.\nFor grants made during 2022, the Compensation Committee selected two performance metrics for our PRSU\nawards to senior management. Fifty percent of the PRSUs are subject to achievement of a cumulative free cash\nflow target established by the Compensation Committee, measured over a performance period. The\nCompensation Committee chose free cash flow as a performance metric for PRSUs because it views free cash flow\nas an important operating metric. The settlement of PRSUs earned in respect of the applicable performance period\nmay be subject to the executive’s continued employment with us for an additional vesting period, which varies for\neach executive officer, following the end of the applicable performance period. This additional time-based feature\ncan serve as a retention tool and results in an equity award that has both time- and performance-based\nvesting elements.\nThe remaining 50% of the PRSUs will cliff vest after a three-year performance period based on the performance of\nour common stock relative to the companies included in the S&P 500 Index. We refer to this performance\nmeasure as a relative “TSR” or “total stockholder return” metric. The Compensation Committee chose relative\nTSR as the performance metric for these PRSUs, with the S&P 500 as the comparative group, because it is an\nobjective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies\nand aligns the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders in creating long-term value.\nPRSUs based on the relative total stockholder return metric will only vest if our performance achieves at least the\n25thpercentile (resulting in 50% of the target PRSUs being earned), with a target payout (i.e., 100% of the target\nPRSUs) requiring performance at the 50thpercentile. For our executive officers, the settlement of PRSUs earned in\nrespect of the applicable three-year performance period is generally subject to the executive officer’s continued\nemployment with us through the third anniversary of the date of their employment agreement. For the rest of our\nsenior management, the settlement of PRSUs is subject to their continued employment through the date the total\nstockholder return performance is certified by the Compensation Committee or the third anniversary of the grant\ndate, whichever is later. If our performance achieves the 75thpercentile, then 150% of the target PRSUs will be\nearned. However, if our absolute TSR is negative, then the number of PRSUs earned cannot exceed 100% of the\ntarget PRSUs.\nIn individual circumstances, the Compensation Committee has varied its practices and has awarded stock options,\nRSUs and PRSUs to our executive officers and other members of senior management that are subject to a\ntwo- year or one-year performance period, generally tied to the term of the executive officer’s employment\nagreement. In 2022, Mr. Verbrugge received grants of stock options and RSUs in 2022 that vest over a one-year\nperiod and a two-year period and PRSUs that are subject to a performance metric measured over both a one-year\nperiod and a two-year period. Similarly, in 2022, Mr. Donnelly received grants of stock options and RSUsthat vest\nover a two-year period and PRSUs that are subject to a performance metric measured over a two-year period.

The long-term nature of the awards serves as our\nprimary retention tool.\nDuring 2022, our long-term equity grants generally consisted of stock options, RSUs and PRSUs (except for\nMs. Witz and Mr. Sullivan who, as explained below, received no long-term equity grants in 2022). The target\naward value of the options, RSUs and PRSUs granted was determined by the Compensation Committee (with the\nassistance of our Chief Executive Officer). The number of stock options granted was equal to the total target value\nof the executive’s individual stock option grant calculated under the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The number of\nRSUs and PRSUs granted was equal to the total target value of the executive’s individual RSU and PRSU\ngrant divided by the average closing price of our common stock reported on NASDAQ for the 20-trading\ndays preceding, but not including, the grant date of the award.\nThe grant date fair value of the awards is identified in the Summary Compensation Table under the\n“Stock Awards” and the “Option Awards” columns, and in the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2022” table.\nThe specific grants made to each executive are described below.\nIn December 2021, we entered intoanemployment agreement with Mr. Inzerillo to serve as our Chief Product\nand Technology Officer effective as of January 10, 2022 and continuing through January 10, 2025.

The remaining fifty percent of the PRSUs awarded to Mr. Verbrugge were also earned on February 9, 2023\nbased on the relative TSR performance of our common stock during 2022. These one year performance-based\nawards were the product of a negotiation with Mr. Verbrugge, including a negotiation regarding the volatility of\nour common stock and the value of these performance-based equity awards in the near and mid-term.

The Deferred Compensation Plan is unsecured, and participation is voluntary. We do not provide\nany matching contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan and do not guarantee above-market returns. The\nappreciation, if any, in the account balances of plan participants is due solely to contributions by participants and\nthe underlying performance of the investment funds selected by the participants.

While these arrangements vary among executives due\nto individual negotiations, none of our employment agreements with our named executive officers include any\ngolden parachute excise tax gross-ups. The material terms of these agreements are described under “Potential\nPayments or Benefits Upon Termination or Change in Control—Employment Agreements.”\nNone of the employment agreements for the named executive officers provide for any payments solely due to a\nchange in control. Under the terms of the 2015 Plan, if the employment of any of our named executive officers is\nterminated by us without cause, or by the executive for good reason, within two years following a change in\ncontrol, then in accordance with the 2015 Plan, their equity awards are subject to accelerated vesting.\nThese arrangements are intended to retain highly qualified executives who could have other job alternatives that\nmay appear to them, in the absence of these arrangements, to be less risky, and such arrangements are designed\nto allow the executives to focus exclusively on our interests.\n49\n2023 Proxy Statement\n105679_02_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:13 AM Page 50\neXeCuTive CoMpenSATion • CoMpenSATion DiSCuSSion AnD AnALySiS\nPerFormanCe aCHIeVement In reSPeCt oF 2022 PerFormanCe year(S)\nVesting of PRSUs Whose Performance Period Included the Year Ending December 31, 2022—Certain PRSUs\ngranted by the Compensation Committee are subject to achievement of a cumulative free cash flow target\nestablished by the Compensation Committee, measured over a two-year performance period.

In addition, the\nCompensation Committee may reward senior management for performance against individual goals linked to our\nperformance. The Compensation Committee will also maintain its ability to apply discretion to awards based on its\nbusiness judgement of our results.\nThe Compensation Committee has chosen to award equity-based compensation to those executive officers who the\nCompensation Committee believes will have a significant impact on our financial, operational and strategic goals.\nThe specific mix of equity-based compensation granted will be determined by the Compensation Committee with the\nassistance of our Chief Executive Officer (for all roles other than her own) and by using their collective informed\njudgment, taking into account the executive’s role and responsibilities and our overall performance.\nStoCK oWnerSHIP reQUIrement\nWe do not require that executives accumulate and maintain a minimum level of stock ownership in us.\nCLaWBaCK/reCoUPment\nAny compensation or equity awards provided to the named executive officers are subject to clawback as may be\nrequired pursuant to any law, regulation or stock exchange listing requirement.

The Compensation Committee does not believe that the lost deduction on compensation payable\nin excess of $1 million for the named executive officers is material relative to the benefit of being able to attract\nand retain talented management; however, the Compensation Committee intends to continue its pay-for-\nperformance philosophy and continue incorporating performance-based elements into our executive\ncompensation programs.\nCompensation Committee report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with\nmanagement.

For Mr. Verbrugge, in regards to his PRSUs granted on\nFebruary9, 2022, 50% of his PRSUs were subject to the achievement of a free cash flow target, established by the Compensation\nCommittee, measured over a one-year performance period; and 50% of his PRSUs were subject to the achievement of a one-year\nTSR of the Company relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 Index as in effect on the first day of the performance period.\nIn regards to his PRSUs granted on July 29, 2022, 50% of his PRSUs are subject to the achievement of a cumulative free cash flow\ntarget, established by the Compensation Committee, measured over a two-year performance period; and 50% of his PRSUs are\nsubject to the achievement of a two-year TSR of the Company relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 Index as in effect\non the first day of the performance period. For Mr. Donnelly, 50% of his PRSUs are subject to the achievement of a cumulative\nfree cash flow target, established by the Compensation Committee, measured over a two-year performance period; and 50% of\nhis PRSUs are subject to the achievement of a two-year TSR of the Company relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 Index\nas in effect on the first day of the performance period. The PRSUs whose achievement is based on free cash flow will vest in full\nupon achievement of 100% or more of the free cash flow target. If the level of free cash flow falls between 80% and 100% of\nthe free cash flow target, then the number of PRSUs that will vest will be determined by straight line interpolation between those\npercentages. If the level of free cash flow is below80% of the target, then none of the PRSUs will vest. The PRSUs whose\nachievement is based on TSR will vest in full if the TSR percentile of the common stock of the Company equals 50% relative to its\nranking within the S&P 500 Index. If the TSR percentile of the common stock of the Company equals or exceeds 75% relative to\nits ranking within the S&P 500 Index, the payout percentage will be 150% of the target PRSUs. If the percentile falls between\n25% and 75%, then the number of PRSUs that will vest will be determined by straight line interpolation between those\npercentages. If the percentile rank is less than 25%, the payout percentage will equal zero. However, if our absolute TSR is\nnegative, then the number of PRSUs earned cannot exceed 100% of the target PRSUs.

Although\nthe Compensation Committee deemed the Deferred Compensation Plan to be a benefit to participants, it is not\nincluded in any quantitative valuation with respect to the three main components of our executive compensation\npackages, because participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan, and to what extent, is at each participant’s\ndiscretion and there is no matching contribution from us at this time.\nPursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees may elect to defer up to 50% of their cash-paid\nbase salary and up to 75% of their annual cash bonus.

This population consisted of our full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary\nworkers and did not include any individuals classified as independent contractors. In accordance with the de\nminimusexemption under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we excluded the group of 240 non-U.S. employees from\nour total employee population, specifically: 14 employees from Britain, four employees from Belgium, nine\nemployees from Canada, one employee from Italy, one employee from Panama, two employees from Malaysia,\nsix employees from the Philippines, and 203 employees from Romania. These non-U.S. individuals represented\napproximately 4% of our total estimated employee population as of December 31, 2022 of 5,883individuals.\nAfter excluding the non-U.S. employees and the current Chief Executive Officer, we included 5,642 employees in\nour calculations to identify the median employee.\nTo identify the median employee from this employee population, we calculated each employee’s total\ncompensation by reviewing employees’ W-2 wages for 2022. Given the even number of employees included in\nour calculation, we were unable to identify an employee who fell at the actual “median” of the employee\npopulation. Once we identified the two employees who fell at the mid-point of our employee population, we\ncalculated all of the elements of both employees’ compensation for the 2022 fiscal year in accordance with the\nrequirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and took the average of those two numbers in order to\ncalculate the “annual total compensation” for purposes of calculating the required pay ratio. This resulted in an\nestimated annual total compensation of $133,411, which we believe reasonably portrays the median level of our\nemployees’ overall compensation profile. To calculate the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive\nOfficer, we used the amount reported for Ms. Witz in the “Total” column of the 2022 Summary Compensation\nTable included in this proxy statement, which was $7,087,004.\nBased on Ms. Witz’s annual total compensation compared to the annual total compensation of our estimated\nmedian employee, our estimated pay ratio is 53:1.\nThis pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and\nemployment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median\ncompensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow\ncompanies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates\nand assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be\ncomparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and\ncompensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in\ncalculating their own pay ratios.\n62\n2023 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/17/23 2:04 PM Page 63\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION • PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE TABLE\nPay Versus Performance Disclosure\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item\n402(v) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship between executive\ncompensation actually paid and certain financial performance of the Company.

We generally seek to\nincentivize long-term performance, but do not specifically design compensation to align the Company’s\nperformance measures with compensation that is actually paid (as computed in accordance with Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K) for a particular year. The Company is providing the following descriptions of the relationships\nbetween information presented in the Pay Versus Performance Table.\nCompensation Actually Paid and Cumulative TSR\nOur stock price and total shareholder return remained essentially unchanged during 2020, 2021 and 2022. The\nCompany paid a special dividend of $0.25 per share in 2022, returning an additional $1 billion to stockholders.\nWhile total shareholder return during this period may not have reflected operational and financial improvements,\nthe amount of CAP to our PEOs and the average amount of CAP to the non-PEO NEOs as a group was generally\naligned with our cumulative TSR over the three years presented in the Pay Versus Performance Table. We believe\nthis alignment is a result of the fact that a significant portion of our NEOs’ pay is comprised of equity-based\nawards, and the calculations for CAP to these individuals for the applicable years includes the fair value of\nequity- based compensation awards.\nCumulative TSR of the Company and Cumulative TSR of the Peer Group\nAs illustrated in the Pay Versus Performance Table above, the Company’s cumulative TSR underperformed when\nviewed against the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Index during the three years presented in the table. During\nthe three-year period ended December 31, 2022, the performance of our common stock,including dividends,\nunderperformed the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Index on a cumulative basis by approximately5percentage\npoints.\n$175\n$150\n$125\n$100\n$75\n$50\nDec-19 Dec-20 Dec-21 Dec-22\nS&P 500 Media and Entertainment Index Sirius XM Holdings Inc.\n66\n2023 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 67\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION • PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE TABLE\nStockholder Return Performance Table\nS&P 500 Media & Sirius xM\nEntertainment Index holdings Inc.\nDecember 31, 2019 $100.00 $100.00\nDecember 31, 2020 $131.17 $ 89.88\nDecember 31, 2021 $166.16 $ 90.57\nDecember 31, 2022 $ 92.95 $ 87.65\nWe determined to change the published industry index used for the required performance graph as the S&P 500 Media and\nEntertainment Index more appropriately reflects the companies with which we compete, including for talent.\nOur management believes that in 2022 our common stock may have been adversely affected by certain\nmacroeconomic conditions, particularly factors affecting the automotive industry. In addition, we believe that\nduring the three-year measurement period, the price of our common stock may have been constrained by certain\nstructural items unique to an investment in the Company, such as the perceived “pair” trade by certain investors\nin our common stock and the related tracking stocks (NASDAQ: LSXMK and LSXMA) issued by Liberty Media\nattempting to profit from the discount in those tracking stocks relative to their underlying asset values, and the\nshort position in our common stock in place by certain investors in securities issued by Liberty Media that are\nconvertibles and/or exchangeable into our common stock. For more information regarding the Company’s\nperformance and the companies that the Compensation Committee considers when determining compensation,\nrefer to “Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis.”\nCompensation Actually Paid and Net Income\nAlthough Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K requires the presentation of net income in our Pay Versus Performance\nTable, the Company does not specifically use a net income target as a performance measure in its executive\ncompensation program as a result of factors that impact net income that do not represent the core performance\nof our business. For example, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $976 million in 2020 related to\nthe Pandora acquisition, which adversely impacted GAAP net income, which was $131.0 million in 2020.Adjusted\nnet income for 2020 was approximately $1.11 billion. Net income for 2021 grew to $1.31 billion on a year-over-\nyear basis but decreased approximately 8% in 2022 compared to the prior year. While the Company does not use a\nnet income target as a performance measure in the overall executive compensation program, net income is\ncorrelated with certain measures used by the Compensation Committee to determine executive compensation,\nincluding adjusted EBITDA and revenue, which the Company does take into account in determining short-term\ncompensation (i.e., annual bonus amounts) that are awarded to our NEOs under our annual bonus program. As\ndescribed in more detail in the section “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the Company targets that\napproximately24% of the value of total compensation awarded to our NEOs consists of amounts determined\nunder our annual bonus program.\nCompensation Actually Paid and Adjusted EBITDA (Our Selected Financial Measure)\nWhile we use numerous financial and non-financial performance measures for the purpose of evaluating\nperformance for our compensation programs, the Company has determined that adjusted EBITDA is the financial\nperformance measure that, in our assessment, represents the most important performance measure (that is not\notherwise required to be disclosed in the Pay Versus Performance Table) used by the Company to link CAP to our\nNEOs to performance for the most recently completed fiscal year.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA (among other financial and non-financial performance criteria) to set goals and\ndetermine payouts under the Company’s performance-based discretionary annual bonus program. The annual\nbonus amounts are partially determined based on achievement against goals, including adjusted EBITDA, set each\nyear by the Compensation Committee. Reflecting strong operating performance and financial results, adjusted\nEBITDA increased 14% in 2020, 8% in 2021 and 2% in 2022, in each case relative to the prior year, and is\ngenerally aligned with the CAP to our NEOs’, including our CEO, for the corresponding years reflected in the Pay\nVersus Performance Table. As described in more detail in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the Company\ntargets that approximately24% of the value of total compensation awarded to our NEOs consists of amounts\ndetermined under our annual bonus program.\n67\n2023 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 68\nItem 2—Advisory Vote to Approve\nNamed Executive Officer\nCompensation\nWe provide stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named\nexecutive officers every three years as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure\nincludes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that\naccompany the compensation tables) (a “say-on-pay proposal”). We believe it is appropriate to seek and take into\naccount the views of stockholders on the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation program.\nOur goal for our executive compensation program is to motivate and retain a talented, entrepreneurial and creative\nteam of executives who will provide leadership for success in the dynamic and highly competitive markets in which\nwe operate. We seek to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance and is aligned with our\nstockholders’ long-term interests. We believe our executive compensation program, which emphasizes long-term\nequity awards, satisfies this goal and is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of stockholders.\nAt our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, approximately 98% of our common stock that voted cast votes in\nfavor of our say-on-pay resolution. We encourage our stockholders to evaluate our executive compensation program\nover a multi-year horizon and to review our named executive officers’ compensation over the past three years as\nreported in the Summary Compensation Table on page52. We have in the past been, and will in the future continue\nto be, engaged with our stockholders on a number of topics and in a number of forums. We view the advisory vote\non executive compensation as an additional, but not exclusive, opportunity for our stockholders to communicate\nwith us regarding their views on executive compensation. Our executive compensation program is designed to\noperate over a period of several years and to enhance long-term performance.\nThe Compensation Discussion and Analysis, beginning on page33of this proxy statement, describes our executive\ncompensation program and the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in 2022 in more detail.\nIn accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, we will\nrequest that stockholders vote to approve the following resolution at the annual meeting:\nRESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement\npursuant to the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the Compensation\nDiscussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation\ntables), is hereby approved.\nAs an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on us, our board of directors or the Compensation Committee, and\nwill not be construed as overruling a decision by our board of directors or the Compensation Committee or creating\nor implying any additional fiduciary duty for us, our board of directors or the Compensation Committee. However,\nthe Compensation Committee and our board of directors values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote\non this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions regarding\nnamed executive officers.\nOur current policy is to provide stockholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of the named\nexecutive officers every three years at the annual meeting of stockholders. It is expected that the next such vote will\noccur at our 2026 annual meeting of stockholders.\n68\n2022 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 69\nITEM 2—ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION\nThis vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather our executive compensation as\ndisclosed in this proxy statement.

We are required to hold this vote once every six years. While the results of the vote are non-\nbinding and advisory in nature, the board of directors intends to consider the results of this vote.\nAfter consideration, the board of directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that\noccurs every three years (triennially) is the most appropriate policy for us. Our reasons include:\n• We value consistency, and we do not expect our executive compensation program to change significantly from\nyear to year;\n• In our view, our executive compensation program does not contain any significant risks that might be of\nconcern to our stockholders;\n• A longer frequency is generally consistent with our long-term compensation objectives; and\n• Our executive compensation program is designed to reward and incentivize long-term performance, and a\ntriennial vote corresponds more closely with our long-term incentive awards.\nWe encourage our stockholders to evaluate our executive compensation program over a multi-year horizon and to\nreview our named executive officers’ compensation over the past three fiscal years as reported in the Summary\nCompensation Table. We believe that a triennial advisory vote on executive compensation reflects the appropriate\ntime frame for our board of directors and Compensation Committee to evaluate the results of the most recent\nadvisory vote on executive compensation, to discuss the implications of that vote with stockholders to the extent\nneeded, to develop and implement any adjustments to our executive compensation program that may be\nappropriate in light of a past advisory vote on executive compensation, and for stockholders to see and evaluate\nthe Compensation Committee’s actions in context. Because the advisory vote on executive compensation occurs\nafter we have already implemented our executive compensation program for the current year, and because the\ndifferent elements of compensation are designed to operate in an integrated manner and to complement one\nanother, in certain cases it may not be appropriate or feasible to fully address and respond to any one year’s\nadvisory vote on executive compensation by the time of the following year’s annual meeting of stockholders.\nWe have in the past been, and will in the future continue to be, engaged with our stockholders on a number of\ntopics and in a number of forums. We view the advisory vote on executive compensation as an additional, but not\nexclusive, opportunity for our stockholders to communicate with us regarding their views on executive\ncompensation. In addition, because our executive compensation program has not typically changed materially\nyear-to-year and is designed to operate over the long-term and to enhance long-term performance, an annual\nadvisory vote on executive compensation could lead to a near-term perspective inappropriately bearing on our\nexecutive compensation programs. We believe that holding an advisory vote on executive compensation every\nthree yearsreflectsthe right balance of considerations in the normal course, but we intend to periodically reassess\nthat view and can provide for an advisory vote on executive compensation on a more frequent basis if changes in\nour compensation program or other circumstances suggest that such a vote would be appropriate.\n70\n2022 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 71\nITEM 3—ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nStockholders will be able to specify one of four choices for this proposal on the proxy card: three years, two years,\none year or abstain. Stockholders are not voting to approve or disapprove the board’s recommendation. This\nadvisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation is non-binding on the board of\ndirectors. Notwithstanding the board’s recommendation and the outcome of the stockholder vote, the board may\nin the future decide to conduct advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on\nfactors such as discussions with stockholders and the adoption of material changes to compensation programs.\nIt is expected that the next such vote will occur at our 2029 annual meeting of stockholders.\n“THREE YEARS”\nThe board of directors recommends that stockholders vote ¸\nwith respect to the frequency with which stockholders are provided an advisory\nvote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers.\n71\n2023 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 72\nItem 4—ratification of Independent\nregistered Public Accountants\nThe Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including approval of the audit fee),\nretention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our financial statements and\nour internal control over financial reporting.

In the course of these reviews, the Audit\nCommittee considers, among other things:\n• KPMG’s historical and recent performance on our audit;\n• KPMG’s capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of our operations;\n• the qualifications of the professionals assigned by KPMG to our audit, including their experience, area of\nexpertise and other factors that could, in the Audit Committee’s opinion, affect the delivery by these\nprofessionals of services;\n• KPMG’s known legal risks and any significant legal or regulatory proceedings in which it is involved;\n• data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on KPMG and its peer firms;\n• the appropriateness of KPMG’s fees for audit and non-audit services, on both an absolute basis and as\ncompared to its peer firms;\n• KPMG’s independence, including the possible effects of its provision of non-audit fees and services on its\nindependence; and\n• KPMG’s tenure as our independent registered public accountants, including the benefits of having an\nindependent registered public accountant that is familiar with us, and the controls and processes that help\nensure KPMG’s independence.\nIn accordance with SEC rules and KPMG policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the\nnumber of consecutive years an individual partner may provide service to us. For lead and concurring audit\npartners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The process for\nselection of our lead audit partner pursuant to this rotation policy involves a meeting between the Chair of the\nAudit Committee and the candidate for the role, as well as discussion by the full Audit Committee and with\nmanagement. The lead audit partner from KPMG assigned to us has served in that role since 2019.\n74\n2022 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 75\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee engages in an annual evaluation of our independent registered public accounting firm’s\nqualifications, assessing the firm’s quality of service, the firm’s sufficiency of resources, the quality of the\ncommunication and interaction with the firm, and the firm’s independence, objectivity, and professional\nskepticism. The Audit Committee also considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different\nindependent public accounting firm.\nThe Audit Committee and the board of directors believe that the continued retention of KPMG as our\nindependent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of our stockholders.\nThe Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public\naccounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of our results and the assessment of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied by us\nin our financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments. Management has\nrepresented to the Audit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed\nand discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and KPMG.\nThe Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002. In this regard, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed, with management and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, management’s annual report on the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2022 and KPMG’s related attestation report.\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters that are required to be discussed under PCAOB\nstandards. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No.\n1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the PCAOB, and Rule 2-07, Communication with\nAudit Committees, of Regulation S-X. The Audit Committee has concluded that KPMG’s provision of audit and\nnon-audit services to us and our affiliates is compatible with KPMG’s independence.\nAt each regularly scheduled meeting, the Audit Committee met and held discussions with management, our\ninternal auditors and KPMG. Prior to their issuance, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our quarterly\nand annual consolidated financial statements (including the presentation of non-GAAP financial information) and\ndisclosures under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”\n(including significant accounting policies and judgments) with management, our internal auditors and KPMG.\nDuring 2022, management, our internal auditors and KPMG also made presentations to the Audit Committee on\nspecific topics of interest, including: our enterprise risk assessment process; our information technology systems\nand controls; our federal and state income tax positions, including our tax strategy and risks; our critical\naccounting policies; our strategy and management of the implementation of new systems; and cyber security.\nIn 2017, the PCAOB adopted a requirement that audit reports for certain companies disclose “critical audit\nmatters,” which are commonly referred to as “CAMs”. Under this auditing standard for the auditor’s reports,\nCAMs are “matters communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involved especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex auditor judgment.” In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Audit Committee and our management had discussions with\nKPMG regarding the CAMs applicable to our company. As part these discussions, the Audit Committee and\nmanagement discussed with KPMG the manner in which KPMG identified the proposed critical audit mattersand\nthe description of the critical audit matters to be included in KPMG’s report.\n75\n2023 PrOxY STATEMENT\n105679_03_Sirius_Proxy.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:14 AM Page 76\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nThe Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the overall scope and plans for their audit and approved the terms of\ntheir engagement, including the fees and non-audit fees payable to KPMG. The Audit Committee is ultimately\nresponsible for the amounts we pay KPMG. After a review of the proposed fee arrangement, including the\nprojected hours and other costs, the Audit Committee approved an engagement letter with KPMG. The Audit\nCommittee has also discussed with our Senior Vice President, Internal Audit, the overall scope of and plans for our\ninternal audits. The Audit Committee met with KPMG and with our internal auditors, in each case, with and\nwithout other members of management present, to discuss the results of their respective examinations, the\nevaluations of our internal controls and the overall quality and integrity of our financial reporting. Additionally, the\nAudit Committee reviewed the performance, responsibilities, budget and staffing of our internal audit\ndepartment. The Audit Committee also has established, and overseen compliance with, procedures for our\nreceipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing\nmatters and our employees’ confidential and anonymous submissions of concerns regarding questionable\naccounting or auditing matters.\nThe Audit Committee discussed with KPMG their independence from the Company and our management,\nincluding the matters, if any, in the written disclosures delivered pursuant to the applicable requirements of the\nPCAOB. The Audit Committee also reviewed our hiring policies and practices with respect to current and former\nemployees of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee preapproved, in\naccordance with its preapproval policy described above, all services provided by the independent registered public\naccounting firm and considered whether the provision of such services to us is compatible with maintaining their\nindependence.\nBased on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of\ndirectors, and the board approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC.\nThis report is provided by the following independent directors, who comprise the Audit Committee:\nKRISTINA M.

Sirius XM’s\npackages include live, curated and certain exclusive and on demand programming. The Sirius XM service is distributed\nthrough our two proprietary satellite radio systems and streamed via applications for mobile devices, home devices and\nother consumer electronic equipment. Satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers, retailers and our\nwebsite. Our Sirius XM service is also available through our in-car user interface, which we call “360L,” that combines\nour satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience.\nThe primary source of revenue from our Sirius XM business is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing\nto monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. We also derive revenue from advertising on select non-music\nchannels, which is sold under the SXM Media brand, direct sales of our satellite radios and accessories, and other\nancillary services. As of December 31, 2022, our Sirius XM business had approximately 34.3 million subscribers.\nIn addition to our audio entertainment businesses, we provide connected vehicle services to several automakers. These\nservices are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience of consumers. We also offer a suite of data\nservices that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings, a traffic information\nservice that includes information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible\nin- vehicle navigation systems, and real-time weather services in vehicles, boats and planes.\nSirius XM also holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada. Sirius XM Canada’s subscribers\nare not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.\nPandora and Off-platform\nPandora operates a music and podcast streaming discovery platform, offering a personalized experience for each\nlistener wherever and whenever they want to listen, whether through computers, tablets, mobile devices, vehicle\nspeakers or connected devices. Pandora enables listeners to create personalized stations and playlists, discover new\ncontent, hear artist- and expert-curated playlists, podcasts and select Sirius XM content as well as search and play songs\nand albums on-demand. Pandora is available as (1) an ad-supported radio service, (2) a radio subscription service\n(Pandora Plus) and (3) an on-demand subscription service (Pandora Premium). As of December 31, 2022, Pandora had\napproximately 6.2 million subscribers.\nThe majority of revenue from Pandora is generated from advertising on our Pandora ad-supported radio service which is\nsold under the SXM Media brand. We also derive subscription revenue from our Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium\nsubscribers.\n1\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 2\nWe also sell advertising on other audio platforms and in widely distributed podcasts, which we consider to be\noff-platform services. We have an arrangement with SoundCloud Holdings, LLC (“SoundCloud”) to be its exclusive ad\nsales representative in the US and certain European countries and offer advertisers the ability to execute campaigns\nacross the Pandora and SoundCloud platforms. We also have arrangements to serve as the ad sales representative for\ncertain podcasts. In addition, through AdsWizz Inc., we provide a comprehensive digital audio and programmatic\nadvertising technology platform, which connects audio publishers and advertisers with a variety of ad insertion,\ncampaign trafficking, yield optimization, programmatic buying, marketplace and podcast monetization solutions.\nLiberty Media\nAs of December 31, 2022, Liberty Media beneficially owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 82% of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock.

The increase was primarily driven by growth in our ARPU of 6% and in our self-pay subscriber base of\n1% driving higher self-pay revenue and U.S. Music Royalty Fees, partially offset by lower revenue generated from\nautomakers offering paid promotional subscriptions.\nWe expect subscriber revenues to increase based on increases in the average price of our subscriptions.\nSirius XM Advertising Revenueincludes the sale of advertising on Sirius XM’s non-music channels.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, advertising revenue was $196 and $188, respectively, an increase of\n4%, or $8.

The decrease was driven by lower royalties due to supplier cost increases related to the semiconductor supply\nshortages as well as lower radio sales; partially offset by higher chipset production driven by an increase in OEM demand.\nWe expect equipment revenue to decrease due to the semiconductor supply shortages driving higher chipset costs.\nSirius XM Other Revenueincludes service and advisory revenue from Sirius XM Canada, revenue from our connected\nvehicle services, and ancillary revenues.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, other revenue was $150 and $151, respectively, a decrease of 1%,\nor $1. The decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue generated from our connected vehicle services, partially\noffset by higher revenue generated by Sirius XM Canada.\nWe expect other revenue to decline as revenue generated by Sirius XM Canada and from our connected vehicle services\ndecrease.\nPandora and Off-platform Revenue\nPandora and Off-platform Subscriber Revenueincludes fees charged for Pandora Plus, Pandora Premium, Stitcher and\nSimplecast subscriptions.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pandora and Off-platform subscriber revenue was $522 and $530,\nrespectively, a decrease of 2%, or $8. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in Pandora’s subscriber base.\nWe expect Pandora and Off-platform subscriber revenues to decline slightly.\nPandora and Off-platform Advertising Revenue is generated primarily from audio, display and video advertising from\non- platform and off-platform advertising.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Pandora and Off-platform advertising revenue was $1,576 and\n$1,542, respectively, an increase of 2%, or $34. The increase was primarily driven by additional revenue generated by\nour Off-platform and podcast businesses, partially offset by a decline in on-platform revenue.\nWe expect Pandora and Off-platform advertising revenue to remain relatively flat given macroeconomic trends as\ngrowth in our Off-platform and podcast businesses is offset by a decline in on-platform revenue.\nTotal Consolidated Revenue\nTotal Consolidated Revenuefor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $9,003 and $8,696, respectively,\nan increase of 4%, or $307.\nSirius xM Cost of Services\nSirius XM Cost of Servicesincludes revenue share and royalties, programming and content, customer service and billing\nand transmission expenses.\n4\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 5\nSirius XM Revenue Share and Royaltiesinclude royalties for transmitting content, including streaming royalties, as well\nas automaker, content provider and advertising revenue share.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue share and royalties were $1,552 and $1,532, respectively,\nan increase of 1%, or $20, but decreased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue. The increase was driven by overall\ngreater revenues subject to revenue share.\nWe expect our Sirius XM revenue share and royalty costs to increase as our revenues grow.\nSirius XM Programming and Contentincludes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. We have entered\ninto various agreements with third parties for music and non-music programming that require us to pay license fees and\nother amounts.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, programming and content expenses were $546 and $511,\nrespectively, an increase of 7%, or $35, and increased as a percentage of total Sirius XM revenue.

We make payments to\nthird party ad servers for the period the advertising impressions are delivered or click-through actions occur, and\naccordingly, we record this as a cost of service in the related period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, revenue share and royalties were $1,250 and $1,140, respectively,\nan increase of 10%, or $110, and increased as a percentage of total Pandora revenue. The increase was primarily due to\ncosts related to the acquisition of rights to sell advertising in certain podcasts.\nWe expect our Pandora and Off-platform revenue share and royalties to increase based on a variety of music-related\nfactors, including higher royalty rates under the statutory webcasting license, and additional costs associated with our\npodcast distribution agreements.\n5\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 6\nPandora and Off-platform Programming and Contentincludes costs to produce live listener events and promote\ncontent.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, programming and content expenses were $58 and $48,\nrespectively, an increase of 21%, or $10, and increased as a percentage of total Pandora revenue. The increase was\nprimarily attributable to higher personnel-related costs.\nWe expect our Pandora and Off-platform programming and content costs to increase as we offer additional\nprogramming and produce live listener events and promotions.\nPandora and Off-platform Customer Service and Billingincludes transaction fees on subscription purchases through\nmobile app stores and bad debt expense.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, customer service and billing expenses were $82 and $86,\nrespectively, a decrease of 5%, or $4, and decreased as a percentage of total Pandora revenue.

The decrease was primarily driven by lower\npersonnel-related costs.\nWe expect our Pandora and Off-platform transmission costs to decrease as a result of lower listener hours.\nOperating Costs\nSubscriber Acquisition Costs are costs associated with our satellite radio service and include hardware subsidies paid to\nradio manufacturers, distributors and automakers; subsidies paid for chipsets and certain other components used in\nmanufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and chipsets; product warranty obligations; and freight. The\nmajority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of acquiring a subscriber. Subscriber\nacquisition costs do not include advertising costs, marketing, loyalty payments to distributors and dealers of satellite\nradios or revenue share payments to automakers and retailers of satellite radios.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, subscriber acquisition costs were $352 and $325, respectively, an\nincrease of 8%, or $27, and increased as a percentage of total revenue. The increase was driven by OEM installations\nwhich grew 10%, compared to the prior year.\nWe expect subscriber acquisition costs to fluctuate with OEM installations. We intend to continue to offer subsidies and\nother incentives to induce OEMs to include our technology in their vehicles.\nSales and Marketing includes costs for marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and\nsponsorships; cooperative and artist marketing; and personnel related costs including salaries, commissions, and sales\nsupport.

The increase was driven by the\naddition of software that was developed and placed in service.\nImpairment, Restructuring and Acquisition Costsrepresents impairment charges, net of insurance recoveries, associated\nwith the carrying amount of an asset exceeding the asset’s fair value, restructuring expenses associated with the\nabandonment of certain leased office spaces and acquisition costs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, impairment, restructuring, and acquisition costs were $64 and $20,\nrespectively. During 2022, we recorded an impairment of $43 associated with terminated software projects, $16 related\nto certain vacated office spaces, $5 in connection with furniture and equipment located at the impaired office spaces,\nand $6 related to personnel severance as well as acquisition related costs of $2; partially offset by $8 from the gain on\nsale of real estate. During 2021, we recorded restructuring costs of $25 resulting from the termination of leased office\nspace and $12 related to acquisition costs, partially offset by the reversal of a liability related to the Stitcher acquisition.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense includes interest on outstanding debt.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, interest expense was $422 and $415, respectively, an increase of\n2%, or $7.

Other\nexpense for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by trading losses associated with the investments\nheld for our Deferred Compensation Plan. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily driven\nby interest earned on our loan to Sirius XM Canada.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome Tax Expense includes the change in our deferred tax assets, current federal and state tax expenses, and foreign\nwithholding taxes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, income tax expense was $392 and $212, respectively, and our\neffective tax rate was 24.4% and 13.9%, respectively.\nOur effective tax rate of 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily impacted by federal and state\nincome tax expense as well as changes in state valuation allowance, partially offset by a benefit related to research and\ndevelopment and certain other credits. Our effective tax rate of 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\nprimarily impacted by federal and state income tax expense, partially offset by settlements with various states as well as\na benefit related to research and development and certain other credits.\n7\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 8\nKEY FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE METRICS\nIn this section, we present certain financial performance measures, some of which are presented as Non-GAAP items,\nwhich include free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. We also present certain operating performance measures. Our\nadjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of share-based payment expense. Additionally, when applicable, our adjusted\nEBITDA metric excludes the effect of significant items that do not relate to the on-going performance of our business.\nWe use these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures to manage our business, to set operational\ngoals and as a basis for determining performance-based compensation for our employees. See the accompanying\nGlossary for more details and for the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure (where applicable).\nWe believe these Non-GAAP financial and operating performance measures provide useful information to investors\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations. We believe these Non-GAAP financial and operating\nperformance measures may be useful to investors in evaluating our core trends because they provide a more direct view\nof our underlying costs. We believe investors may use our adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and\nto make investment decisions. We believe free cash flow provides useful supplemental information to investors\nregarding our cash available for future subscriber acquisitions and capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to\nacquire other companies and our ability to return capital to stockholders. By providing these Non-GAAP financial and\noperating performance measures, together with the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure\n(where applicable), we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations.\nOur Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for or superior to, our\nreported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our Non-GAAP financial measures may not be\ncomparable to similarly-titled measures by other companies. Please refer to the Glossary for a further discussion of such\nNon-GAAP financial and operating performance measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nmeasure (where applicable).

The increase was\ndue to growth in our self-pay subscriber base, partially offset by the decline in paid promotional subscribers generated\nby automakers driven by a shift to shorter paid trials and unpaid trials.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net subscriber additions were 272 and (681), respectively, an\nincrease of 140%, or 953. The increase was driven by paid promotional net additions, which remained negative, but\nincreased compared to the prior year due to certain developments experienced during the first half of 2021, including\nthe impact of the semiconductor supply shortage as well as a shift to free trials at certain automakers. Self-pay net\nadditions decreased driven by a lower trial funnel and lower vehicle conversion rates, partially offset by lower voluntary\nchurn as well as growth in streaming net additions.\nSirius XM Canada Subscribers.At December 31, 2022, Sirius XM Canada had approximately 2,567 subscribers, an\nincrease of 50, or 2%, from the approximately 2,517 Sirius XM Canada subscribers as of December 31, 2021.\nAverage Self-pay Monthly Churnis derived by dividing the monthly average of self-pay deactivations for the period by\nthe average number of self-pay subscribers for the period. (See accompanying Glossary for more details.)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our average self-pay monthly churn rate was 1.5% and 1.6%,\nrespectively. The decrease was driven by lower voluntary and vehicle related churn.\nARPUis derived from total earned subscriber revenue (excluding revenue derived from our connected vehicle services)\nand net advertising revenue, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the daily weighted average\nnumber of subscribers for the period. (See the accompanying Glossary for more details.)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, ARPU was $15.63 and $14.76, respectively. The increase was driven\nby increases in certain subscription rates, partially offset by the impact of the mix of promotional plans.\n9\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 10\nSAC, Per Installation,is derived from subscriber acquisition costs less margins from the sale of radios, components and\naccessories (excluding connected vehicle services), divided by the number of satellite radio installations in new vehicles\nand shipments of aftermarket radios for the period. (See the accompanying Glossary for more details.)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, SAC, per installation, was $14.32 and $12.58, respectively. The\nincrease was driven by higher OEM hardware subsidy rates combined with a change in the mix of OEMs and higher\nchipset costs due to the semiconductor supply shortages.\nPandora and Off-platform\nMonthly Active Users.At December 31, 2022, Pandora had approximately 47,638 monthly active users, a decrease of\n4,637 monthly active users, or 9%, from the 52,275 monthly active users as of December 31, 2021. The decrease in\nmonthly active users was driven by an increase in ad-supported listener churn and a decrease in the number of new users.\nSubscribers.At December 31, 2022, Pandora had approximately 6,215 subscribers, a decrease of 178, or 3%, from the\napproximately 6,393 subscribers as of December 31, 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net subscriber additions were (178) and 52, respectively, a decrease\nof 442%, or 230. Net additions decreased as a result of a decline in trial starts.\nAd supported listener hoursare a key indicator of our Pandora business and the engagement of our Pandora listeners. We\ninclude ad supported listener hours related to Pandora’s non-radio content offerings in the definition of listener hours.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, ad supported listener hours was 10.88 billion and 11.55 billion,\nrespectively. The decrease in ad supported listener hours was primarily driven by the decline in monthly active users,\npartially offset by higher hours per active user.\nRPMis a key indicator of our ability to monetize advertising inventory created by our listener hours on the Pandora\nservices. Ad RPM is calculated by dividing advertising revenue by the number of thousands of listener hours to our\nPandora advertising-based service.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, RPM was $101.19 and $102.74, respectively. The decrease was a\nresult of a decline in sell-through.\nTotal Company\nAdjusted EBITDA.EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and\namortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes or adjusts for the impact of other expense (income), loss on extinguishment of\ndebt, impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, other non-cash charges such as share-based payment expense,\nand legal settlements and reserves (if applicable).

The increase was due to higher subscriber and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher revenue\nshare and royalties, programming, and subscriber acquisition costs.\nFree Cash Flowincludes cash provided by operations plus insurance recoveries on our satellites, net of additions to\nproperty and equipment, and restricted and other investment activity. (See the accompanying Glossary for a\nreconciliation to GAAP and for more details.)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, free cash flow was $1,551 and $1,831, respectively, a decrease of\n$280, or 15%. The decrease was driven by satellite insurance recoveries in 2021 and higher income tax payments;\npartially offset by cash received from customers.\n10\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 11\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flow activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with\nthe year ended December 31, 2021.

We also generate cash from the sale of advertising through our Pandora business, advertising on certain\nnon- music channels on Sirius XM and the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories. Our primary uses of cash\nfrom operating activities include revenue share and royalty payments to distributors, programming and content\nproviders, and payments to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers. In addition, uses of cash from operating\nactivities include payments to vendors to service, maintain and acquire listeners and subscribers, general corporate\nexpenditures, and compensation and related costs.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to spending for\ncapitalized software and hardware, to construct satellites, and acquisitions for total cash consideration of $136. Cash\nflows used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to spending primarily for\ncapitalized software and hardware, and to construct a replacement satellite, partially offset by proceeds collected from\nsatellite insurance policies associated with SXM-7. We spent $247 and $238 on capitalized software and hardware as\nwell as $122 and $93 to construct satellites during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities consists of the issuance and repayment of long-term debt, the purchase of\ncommon stock under our share repurchase program, the payment of cash dividends and taxes paid in lieu of shares\nissued for stock-based compensation. Proceeds from long-term debt have been used to fund our operations, construct\nand launch new satellites, fund acquisitions, invest in other infrastructure improvements and purchase shares of our\ncommon stock.\nCash flows used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022 were primarily due to the payment of\ncash dividends of $1,339, the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock under our repurchase program\nfor $647, and payment of $114 for taxes in lieu of shares issued for share-based compensation, partially offset by net\nborrowings under our Credit Facility of $80 and an amendment to our Credit Facility to incorporate an Incremental\nTerm Loan borrowing of $500 ($499 net of costs) which matures on April 11, 2024. Cash flows used in financing\nactivities in the year ended December 31, 2021 were primarily due to the redemptions of Sirius XM’s 3.875% Senior\nNotes due 2022 for $1,019, 4.625% Senior Notes due 2024 for $1,541 and 5.375% Senior Notes due 2026 for\n$1,034, the purchase and retirement of shares of our common stock under our repurchase program for $1,523, the\npayment of cash dividends of $268, payment of $103 for taxes in lieu of shares issued for share-based compensation,\nand the repayment of borrowings under our Credit Facility of $653; partially offset by the issuance of $2,000 in\naggregate principal amount of Sirius XM’s 4.00% Senior Notes due 2028, $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of\nSirius XM’s 3.125% Senior Notes due 2026, and $1,500 in aggregate principal amount of Sirius XM’s 3.875% Senior\nNotes due 2031.\n11\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 12\nFuture Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nBased upon our current business plans, we expect to fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the\nconstruction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities\nof our debt with existing cash, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. As of December 31,\n2022, $80 was outstanding under our Credit Facility and $1,670 was available for future borrowing under our Credit\nFacility. We believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents, as well as debt capacity, to cover our estimated\nshort-term and long-term funding needs, including amounts to construct, launch and insure replacement satellites, as\nwell as fund future stock repurchases, future dividend payments and to pursue strategic opportunities.\nOur ability to meet our debt and other obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic,\nfinancial, competitive and other factors.\nWe regularly evaluate our business plans and strategy. These evaluations often result in changes to our business plans\nand strategy, some of which may be material and significantly change our cash requirements. These changes in our\nbusiness plans or strategy may include: the acquisition of unique or compelling programming; the development and\nintroduction of new features or services; significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; investments in\ninfrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions\nand investments that are not directly related to our existing business.\nWe may from time to time purchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated\ntransactions or otherwise. Purchases or retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity\nrequirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nCapital Return Program\nAs of December 31, 2022, our board of directors had authorized for repurchase an aggregate of $18,000 of our\ncommon stock. As of December 31, 2022, our cumulative repurchases since December 2012 under our stock\nrepurchase program totaled 3,662 shares for $16,558, and $1,442 remained available for additional repurchases under\nour existing stock repurchase program authorization.\nShares of common stock may be purchased from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated\ntransactions, including in accelerated stock repurchase transactions and transactions with Liberty Media and its affiliates.\nWe intend to fund the additional repurchases through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations\nand future borrowings. The size and timing of any purchases will be based on a number of factors, including price and\nbusiness and market conditions.\nOn January 25, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock in the amount of\n$0.0242 per share of common stock payable on February 24, 2023 to stockholders of record as of the close of business\non February 9, 2023.\nDebt Covenants\nThe indentures governing Sirius XM’s senior notes and Pandora’s convertible notes and the agreement governing the\nSirius XM Credit Facility include restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with such\ncovenants. For a discussion of our “Debt Covenants,” refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this\nAnnual Report\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed in Note 16 to our\nconsolidated financial statements this Annual Report that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Cash Commitments\nFor a discussion of our “Contractual Cash Commitments,” refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in\nthis Annual Report.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of “Related Party Transactions,” refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements in this\nAnnual Report.\n12\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 13\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods. Accounting estimates require the\nuse of significant management assumptions and judgments as to future events, and the effect of those events cannot\nbe predicted with certainty. The accounting estimates will change as new events occur, more experience is acquired and\nmore information is obtained. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and use\noutside experts to assist in that evaluation when we deem necessary. We have identified all significant accounting\npolicies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nNon-Financial Instrument Valuations.Our non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our\ndetermination of the estimated fair value allocation of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in\nbusiness combinations, our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable\nintangibles, such as trademarks, and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain\ntriggering events. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, we are required to\nwrite the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in Impairment, restructuring and acquisition\ncosts in our consolidated statement of operations. Judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived\nassets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation\ntechniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well\nas other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the degree of judgment involved in our\nestimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value.\nAs each of our operating segments has long-lived assets, this critical accounting policy affects the financial position and\nresults of operations of each segment.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our consolidated reportable\nsegments were as follows (amounts in millions):\nGoo d w i l l FCC Licenses Trademarks Total\nSirius XM $2,2 9 0 $2,084 $250 $4,624\nPandora and Off-platform 9 5 9 — 312 1,271\nConsolidated $3,2 4 9 $2,084 $562 $5,895\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets in\nthe fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.\nThe accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than\nnot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is\nnecessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option\nto bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative\nimpairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating\ngoodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates\nother relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not\nthat an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any\nnegative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased\ncosts in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company\nspecific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for\ncertain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes.\nIf based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the\nquantitative impairment test.\nUseful Life of Broadcast/Transmission System.Our satellite system includes the costs of our satellite construction, launch\nvehicles, launch insurance, capitalized interest, spare satellites, terrestrial repeater network and satellite uplink facilities.\nWe monitor our satellites for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of the asset is not recoverable.\nWe operate two in-orbit Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6, which launched in 2009 and 2013, respectively, and estimate\nthey will operate effectively through the end of their depreciable lives in 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nWe currently operate four in-orbit XM satellites, XM-3, XM-4, XM-5 and SXM-8. Our XM-3 satellite launched in 2005\nand our XM-4 satellite launched in 2006 are used as in-orbit spares and reached the end of their depreciable lives in\n2020 and 2021, respectively. Our XM-5 satellite was launched in 2010 and is expected to reach the end of its\n13\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 14\ndepreciable life in 2025. SXM-7 was launched into a geostationary orbit in December 2020 and in-orbit testing of\nSXM- 7 began on January 4, 2021. During in-orbit testing of SXM-7 events occurred which caused failures of certain\nSXM-7 payload units. The evaluation of SXM-7 concluded that the satellite would not function as intended and the\nasset was fully impaired in 2021. Our SXM-8 satellite was successfully launched into a geostationary orbit on June 6,\n2021 and was placed into service on September 8, 2021 following the completion of in-orbit testing. Our SXM-8\nsatellite replaced our XM-3 satellite. We have entered into agreements for the design and construction of four\nadditional satellites, SXM-9, SXM-10, SXM-11 and SXM-12. We have also entered into agreements to launch two of\nthese satellites.\nOur satellites have been designed to last fifteen-years. Our in-orbit satellites may experience component failures which\ncould adversely affect their useful lives. We monitor the operating condition of our in-orbit satellites and if events or\ncircumstances indicate that the depreciable lives of our in-orbit satellites have changed, we will modify the depreciable\nlife accordingly. If we were to revise our estimates, our depreciation expense would change.\nIncome Taxes.Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between\nthe carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes,\nbased on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to\naffect taxable income.\nWe assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets at each reporting date and, where applicable, a valuation allowance is\nrecognized when, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that all, or some\nportion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our assessment includes an analysis of whether deferred tax\nassets will be realized in the ordinary course of operations based on the available positive and negative evidence,\nincluding the scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and forecasted income from operations. The underlying assumptions\nwe use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment. In the event that actual income from\noperations differs from forecasted amounts, or if we change our estimates of forecasted income from operations, we\ncould record additional charges or reduce allowances in order to adjust the carrying value of deferred tax assets to their\nrealizable amount. Such adjustments could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $113 relating to deferred tax assets that are not more likely\nthan not to be realized due to the timing of certain state net operating loss limitations and acquired net operating losses\nthat were not likely to be utilized.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will\nbe sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the\nposition and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not\nthreshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be\nrealized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. If the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained,\nthe gross amount of the unrecognized tax position will not be recorded in the financial statements but will be shown in\ntabular format within the uncertain income tax positions. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the\nperiod in which the change in judgment occurs due to the following conditions: (1) the tax position is “more likely than\nnot” to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation,\nor (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax\nposition is effectively settled or until there is a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations. We record interest and\npenalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome. As of December 31, 2022, the gross liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions was $198.\nGlossary\nMonthly active users—the number of distinct registered users on the Pandora services, including subscribers, which\nhave consumed content within the trailing 30 days to the end of the final calendar month of the period.

Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for the impact of other\nexpense (income), loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs, other non-cash\ncharges such as share-based payment expense, and legal settlements and reserves (if applicable). We believe adjusted\nEBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of our operating performance, which provides useful information\nabout our business apart from the costs associated with our capital structure and purchase price accounting. We believe\ninvestors find this Non-GAAP financial measure useful when analyzing our past operating performance with our current\nperformance and comparing our operating performance to the performance of other communications, entertainment\nand media companies. We believe investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate our current enterprise value and to make\ninvestment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in our satellite radio system, our results of operations\nreflect significant charges for depreciation expense. We believe the exclusion of share-based payment expense is useful\nas it is not directly related to the operational conditions of our business. We also believe the exclusion of the legal\nsettlements and reserves, impairment, restructuring and acquisition related costs, and loss on extinguishment of debt, to\nthe extent they occur during the period, is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of our normal\noperations for the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income of certain expenses, including share-based payment expense. We endeavor to compensate\nfor the limitations of the Non-GAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or\ngreater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the Non-GAAP\nmeasure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate our operating results after giving effect for these costs should\nrefer to net income as disclosed in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a\nNon-GAAP financial performance measure, our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying\ncalculations; may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies; and should not be\nconsidered in isolation, as a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:\nFo Yre tahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021\nNet income: $1 , 2 1 3 $1,314\nAdd back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA:\nImpairment, restructuring and acquisition costs 6 4 20\nShare-based payment expense(1) 1 9 7 202\nDepreciation and amortization 5 3 6 533\nInterest expense 4 2 2 415\nLoss on extinguishment of debt — 83\nOther expense (income) 9 (9)\nIncome tax expense 3 9 2 212\nAdjusted EBITDA $2 , 8 3 3 $2,770\n(1) Allocation of share-based payment expense:\nProgramming and content 3 4 $ $ 33\nCustomer service and billing 6 6\nTransmission 6 6\nSales and marketing 5 2 58\nEngineering, design and development 3 9 36\nGeneral and administrative 6 0 63\nTotal share-based payment expense $ 1 9 7 $202\nFree cash flow—is derived from cash flow provided by operating activities plus insurance recoveries on our satellites,\nnet of additions to property and equipment and purchases of other investments. Free cash flow is a metric that our\nmanagement and board of directors use to evaluate the cash generated by our operations, net of capital expenditures\nand other investment activity. In a capital intensive business, with significant investments in satellites, we look at our\noperating cash flow, net of these investing cash outflows, to determine cash available for future subscriber acquisition\nand capital expenditures, to repurchase or retire debt, to acquire other companies and to evaluate our ability to return\ncapital to stockholders. We exclude from free cash flow certain items that do not relate to the on-going performance of\nour business, such as cash flows related to acquisitions, strategic and short-term investments, net loan activity with\n15\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 16\nrelated parties and other equity investees, and proceeds from the sale of real estate. We believe free cash flow is an\nindicator of the long-term financial stability of our business. Free cash flow, which is reconciled to “Net cash provided by\noperating activities,” is a Non-GAAP financial measure. This measure can be calculated by deducting amounts under the\ncaptions “Additions to property and equipment” and deducting or adding Restricted and other investment activity from\n“Net cash provided by operating activities” from the consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow should be\nused in conjunction with other GAAP financial performance measures and may not be comparable to free cash flow\nmeasures presented by other companies. Free cash flow should be viewed as a supplemental measure rather than an\nalternative measure of cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow is\nlimited and does not represent remaining cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the\nmeasure does not deduct the payments required for debt maturities. We believe free cash flow provides useful\nsupplemental information to investors regarding our current cash flow, along with other GAAP measures (such as cash\nflows from operating and investing activities), to determine our financial condition, and to compare our operating\nperformance to other communications, entertainment and media companies. Free cash flow is calculated as follows:\nFo Yre tahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021\nCash Flow information\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,9 7 6 $ 1,998\nNet cash used in investing activities (5 4 8 ) (200)\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,5 6 2 ) (1,682)\nFree Cash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities 1,9 7 6 1,998\nAdditions to property and equipment (4 2 6 ) (388)\nSale (purchases) of other investments 1 (4)\nSatellite insurance recoveries — 225\nFree cash flow $ 1 , 5 5 1 $ 1,831\nARPU—Sirius XM ARPU is derived from total earned subscriber revenue (excluding revenue associated with our\nconnected vehicle services) and advertising revenue, divided by the number of months in the period, divided by the\ndaily weighted average number of subscribers for the period.\nSubscriber acquisition cost, per installation—or SAC, per installation, is derived from subscriber acquisition costs\nless margins from the sale of radios and accessories (excluding connected vehicle services), divided by the number of\nsatellite radio installations in new vehicles and shipments of aftermarket radios for the period.

To the extent that third-party measurements of advertising\nhours are not calculated using a similar server-based approach, the third-party measurements may differ from our\nmeasurements.\nRPM—is calculated by dividing advertising revenue, excluding AdsWizz and other off-platform revenue, by the number\nof thousands of listener hours on our Pandora advertising-based service.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022, our board of directors had authorized us to repurchase an aggregate of $18.0 billion of our\ncommon stock and have not establish an end date for this stock repurchase program. Shares of common stock may be\npurchased from time to time on the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, in privately negotiated transactions, including transactions with Liberty Media and\nits affiliates, or otherwise. As of December 31, 2022, our cumulative repurchases since December 2012 under our stock\nrepurchase program totaled 3.7 billion shares for approximately $16.6 billion, and approximately $1.4 billion remained\navailable under our existing $18.0 billion stock repurchase program.

We hold investments in money market funds and\ncertificates of deposit. These securities are consistent with the objectives contained within our investment policy. The\nbasic objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of capital, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet\noperating requirements and maximizing yield.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we also held the following investment:\nIn connection with the recapitalization of Sirius XM Canada on May 25, 2017, we loaned Sirius XM Canada\n$130.8 million. The loan is considered a long-term investment with any unrealized gains or losses reported within\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. The loan has a term of fifteen years, bears interest at a rate of\n7.62% per annum and includes customary covenants and events of default, including an event of default relating to\nSirius XM Canada’s failure to maintain specified leverage ratios. The carrying value of the loan as of December 31, 2022\nwas $8.0 million and approximated its fair value. The loan is denominated in Canadian dollars and it is subject to\nchanges in foreign currency. Had the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate been 10% lower as of December 31, 2022,\nthe value of this loan would have been approximately $0.8 million lower.\nOur debt includes fixed rate instruments and the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nSirius XM’s borrowings under the Credit Facility carry a variable interest rate, which is currently based on LIBOR (except\nfor the Incremental Term Loan which carries a variable interest rate based on SOFR), plus an applicable rate based on its\ndebt to operating cash flow ratio. We currently do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure\nto interest rate fluctuations.\nChANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITh ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNone.\n19\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page 20\n(This Page Intentionally Left Blank)\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-1\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTO ThE STOCKhOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nSIRIUS xM hOLDINGS INC.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income,\nstockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2022,\nand the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the cons-olidated financial statements). In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years\nin the three year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n-\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework(2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion\non the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the\nU.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and\nthat: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved\nour especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSufficiency of audit evidence over certain subscriber and advertising revenues\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income, the Company generated $9,003 million of revenues, of which $6,370 million was Sirius XM\nsubscriber revenue and $1,576 million was Pandora (Pandora Media, LLC and subsidiaries, the successor to Pandora\nMedia, Inc. and subsidiaries) advertising revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s accounting\nfor these subscriber and advertising revenues involved multiple information technology (IT) systems.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence related to Sirius XM subscriber revenue and Pandora\nadvertising revenue as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required auditor\njudgment due to the number of IT applications used by the Company that involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge.\nF-1\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-2\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over subscriber and advertising revenues.\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Sirius XM\nsubscriber and Pandora advertising revenue recognition processes. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills\nand knowledge, who assisted in testing certain IT application controls and general IT controls used by the Company in\nits revenue recognition processes and testing the interface of relevant revenue data between different IT systems used in\nthe revenue recognition processes. For Sirius XM subscriber revenue, we assessed the recorded revenue by comparing\nthe total cash received during the year, adjusted for reconciling items, to the revenue recorded in the general ledger. For\na sample of Pandora advertising revenues, we traced the recorded amounts to underlying source documents and system\nreports. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed,\nincluding the appropriateness of the nature and extent of such evidence.\nFair values of the Pandora and Off-Platform reporting unit and the Pandora trademark\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance for the Pandora and\nOff-Platform reporting unit was $959 million as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, as discussed in Note 9 to the\nconsolidated financial statements, the trademarks balance due to acquisitions recorded to the Pandora and Off-Platform\nreporting unit was $312 million as of December 31, 2022, a portion of which related to the Pandora trademark. The\nCompany performs goodwill and indefinite-lived assets impairment testing on an annual basis during the fourth quarter\nof each fiscal year, and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting\nunit or a trademark more likely than not exceeds its fair value.\nWe identified the assessment of the fair values of the Pandora and Off-Platform reporting unit and the Pandora\ntrademark as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain\nassumptions used by the Company to estimate these fair values. Specifically, the revenue growth rates, long-term\ngrowth rate, and the discount rates involved a higher degree of subjectivity. In addition, these key assumptions were\nchallenging to test due to the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in these assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design\nand tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s goodwill and trademark\nimpairment assessment process, including controls related to the key assumptions noted above. We performed\nsensitivity analyses to assess the impact of possible changes to the revenue growth rates, long-term growth rate and\ndiscount rates assumptions on the fair value of the Pandora and Off-Platform reporting unit and Pandora trademark.\nWe compared the Company’s historical revenue forecasts to actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately\nforecast revenues. We compared the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rate assumptions to historical revenue\ngrowth rates, to projected revenue growth rates for comparable companies, and to other publicly available data,\nincluding third party market studies. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n• evaluating the Company’s long-term growth rate by comparing it to long-term growth rate estimates that were\nindependently developed using publicly available market data for the Company’s industry as well as U.S. economic\ngrowth rates\n• evaluating the Company’s discount rates by comparing them to discount rates that were independently developed\nusing publicly available market data for comparable companies.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary2, 2023\nF-2\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTO ThE STOCKhOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nSIRIUS xM hOLDINGS INC.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework(2013)issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework(2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively,\nthe consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on\nthose consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 2, 2023\nF-3\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-4\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and

The\nterms “Holdings,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “our company” as used herein, and unless otherwise stated or indicated by\ncontext, refer to Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries. “Sirius XM” refers to our wholly owned subsidiary\nSirius XM Radio Inc. and its subsidiaries. “Pandora” refers to Sirius XM’s wholly owned subsidiary Pandora Media, LLC\nand its subsidiaries. Holdings has no operations independent of Sirius XM and Pandora.\nBusiness\nWe operate two complementary audio entertainment businesses - one of which we refer to as “Sirius XM” and the\nsecond of which we refer to as “Pandora and Off-platform”. We are the leading audio entertainment company in North\nAmerica with a portfolio of audio businesses including our flagship subscription entertainment service, Sirius XM; the\nad-supported and premium music streaming services of Pandora; a podcast network; an advertising sales group, SXM\nMedia; and a suite of advertising technology solutions.\nSirius XM\nOur Sirius XM business features music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels and\nother content, as well as podcasts and infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis. Sirius XM\npackages include live, curated and certain exclusive and on demand programming. The Sirius XM service is distributed\nthrough our two proprietary satellite radio systems and streamed via applications for mobile devices, home devices and\nother consumer electronic equipment. Satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers, retailers and our\nwebsite. Our Sirius XM service is also available through our in-car user interface, which we call “360L,” that combines\nour satellite and streaming services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience.\nThe primary source of revenue from our Sirius XM business is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing\nto monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. We also derive revenue from advertising on select non-music\nchannels, which is sold under the SXM Media brand, direct sales of our satellite radios and accessories, and other\nancillary services. As of December 31, 2022, our Sirius XM business had approximately 34.3 million subscribers.\nIn addition to our audio entertainment businesses, we provide connected vehicle services to several automakers. These\nservices are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience of consumers. We also offer a suite of data\nservices that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings, a traffic information\nservice that includes information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible\nin- vehicle navigation systems, and real-time weather services in vehicles, boats and planes.\nSirius XM also holds a 70% equity interest and 33% voting interest in Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. (“Sirius XM\nCanada”). Sirius XM Canada’s subscribers are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.\nPandora and Off-platform\nOur Pandora and Off-platform business operates a music and podcast streaming discovery platform, offering a\npersonalized experience for each listener wherever and whenever they want to listen, whether through computers,\ntablets, mobile devices, vehicle speakers or connected devices. Pandora enables listeners to create personalized stations\nand playlists, discover new content, hear artist- and expert-curated playlists, podcasts and select Sirius XM content as\nwell as search and play songs and albums on-demand. Pandora is available as (1) an ad-supported radio service, (2) a\nradio subscription service (Pandora Plus) and (3) an on-demand subscription service (Pandora Premium). As of\nDecember 31, 2022, Pandora had approximately 6.2 million subscribers.\nThe majority of revenue from Pandora is generated from advertising on our Pandora ad-supported radio service which is\nsold under the SXM Media brand. We also derive subscription revenue from our Pandora Plus and Pandora Premium\nsubscribers.\nWe also sell advertising on other audio platforms and in widely distributed podcasts, which we consider to be\noff- platform services. We have an arrangement with SoundCloud Holdings, LLC (“SoundCloud”) to be its exclusive ad\nsales representative in the US and certain European countries and offer advertisers the ability to execute campaigns\nF-9\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-10\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nacross the Pandora and SoundCloud platforms. We also have arrangements to serve as the ad sales representative for\ncertain podcasts. In addition, through AdsWizz Inc., we provide a comprehensive digital audio and programmatic\nadvertising technology platform, which connects audio publishers and advertisers with a variety of ad insertion,\ncampaign trafficking, yield optimization, programmatic buying, marketplace and podcast monetization solutions.\nLiberty Media\nAs of December 31, 2022, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) beneficially owned, directly and indirectly,\napproximately 82% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” for the\npurposes of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements. Refer to Note 12 for more information regarding related\nparties.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Holdings have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. Certain numbers in our prior period consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been\nreclassified or consolidated to conform to our current period presentation.\nPublic companies are required to disclose certain information about their reportable operating segments. Operating\nsegments are defined as significant components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available\nand is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources to an\nindividual segment and in assessing performance of the segment. We have determined that we have two reportable\nsegments as our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, assesses performance and allocates\nresources based on the financial results of these segments. Refer to Note 18 for information related to our segments.\nWe have evaluated events subsequent to the balance sheet date and prior to the filing of this Annual Report for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 and have determined that no events have occurred that would require adjustment to\nour consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of subsequent events that do not require adjustment to our\nconsolidated financial statements refer to Note 19.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes. Estimates, by their nature, are\nbased on judgment and available information. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Significant\nestimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include asset impairment,\ndepreciable lives of our satellites, share-based payment expense and income taxes.\n(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIn addition to the significant accounting policies discussed in this Note 2, the following table includes our significant\naccounting policies that are described in other notes to our consolidated financial statements, including the number and\npage of the note:\nSignificant Accounting Policy N o t e # Page #\nAcquisition 3 F-14\nFair Value Measurements 4 F-15\nGoodwill 8 F-17\nIntangible Assets 9 F-18\nProperty and Equipment 1 0 F-20\nEquity Method Investments 1 2 F-23\nShare-Based Compensation 1 5 F-28\nLegal Reserves 1 6 F-31\nIncome Taxes 1 7 F-34\nF-10\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-11\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOur cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, money market funds, certificates of deposit, in-transit credit\ncard receipts and highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured according to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue -Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers,and is recognized based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and excludes any\nsales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance\nobligation by transferring control over a service or product to a customer. We report revenues net of any tax assessed by\na governmental authority that is both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue-producing transaction\nbetween a seller and a customer in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Collected taxes are recorded\nwithin Other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant taxing authority. For equipment sales, we are responsible for\narranging for shipping and handling. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded as revenue and are\nreported as a component of Cost of equipment.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate our revenue, including from self-pay\nand paid promotional subscribers, advertising, and sales of equipment.\nSubscriber revenue consists primarily of subscription fees and other ancillary subscription based revenues. Revenue is\nrecognized on a straight line basis when the performance obligations to provide each service for the period are satisfied,\nwhich is over time as our subscription services are continuously transmitted and can be consumed by customers at any\ntime. Consumers purchasing or leasing a vehicle with a factory-installed satellite radio may receive between a three and\ntwelve month subscription to our service. In certain cases, the subscription fees for these consumers are prepaid by the\napplicable automaker. Prepaid subscription fees received from automakers or directly from consumers are recorded as\ndeferred revenue and amortized to revenue ratably over the service period which commences upon sale. Activation fees\nare recognized over one month as the activation fees are non-refundable and do not provide for a material right to the\ncustomer. There is no revenue recognized for unpaid trial subscriptions. In some cases we pay a loyalty fee to the\nautomakers when we receive a certain amount of payments from self-pay customers acquired from that automaker.\nThese fees are considered incremental costs to obtain a contract and are, therefore, recognized as an asset and\namortized to Subscriber acquisition costs over an average subscriber life. Revenue share and loyalty fees paid to an\nautomaker offering a paid trial are accounted for as a reduction of revenue as the payment does not provide a distinct\ngood or service.\nMusic royalty fee primarily consists of U.S. music royalty fees (“MRF”) collected from subscribers. The related costs we\nincur for the right to broadcast music and other programming are recorded as Revenue share and royalties expense.\nFees received from subscribers for the MRF are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized to Subscriber revenue\nratably over the service period.\nWe recognize revenue from the sale of advertising as performance obligations are satisfied, which generally occurs as\nads are delivered. For our satellite radio service, ads are delivered when they are aired. For our streaming services, ads\nare delivered primarily based on impressions. Agency fees are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross\nbilling revenue for our advertising inventory and are reported as a reduction of advertising revenue. Additionally, we pay\ncertain third parties a percentage of advertising revenue. Advertising revenue is recorded gross of such revenue share\npayments as we control the advertising service, including the ability to establish pricing, and we are primarily responsible\nfor providing the service. Advertising revenue share payments are recorded to Revenue share and royalties during the\nperiod in which the advertising is transmitted.\nEquipment revenue and royalties from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories are recognized upon\nshipment, net of discounts and rebates. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded as revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with shipping goods to customers are reported as a component of Cost of\nequipment. Other revenue primarily includes revenue recognized from royalties received from Sirius XM Canada.\nF-11\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-12\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nCustomers pay for the services in advance of the performance obligation and therefore these prepayments are recorded\nas deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized as revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive\nincome as the services are provided. Changes in the deferred revenue balance during the year ended December 31,\n2022 were not materially impacted by other factors.\nAs the majority of our contracts are one year or less, we have utilized the optional exemption under ASC 606-10-50-14\nand do not disclose information about the remaining performance obligations for contracts which have original\nexpected durations of one year or less. As of December 31, 2022, less than six percent of our total deferred revenue\nbalance related to contracts that extend beyond one year. These contracts primarily include prepaid data trials which are\ntypically provided for three to five years as well as for self-pay customers who prepay for their audio subscriptions for up\nto three years in advance. These amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis as our services are provided.\nRevenue Share\nWe share a portion of our subscription revenues earned from self-pay subscribers with certain automakers. The terms of\nthe revenue share agreements vary with each automaker, but are typically based upon the earned audio revenue as\nreported or gross billed audio revenue. Revenue share on self-pay revenue is recognized as an expense and recorded in\nRevenue share and royalties in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We also pay revenue share to\ncertain talent on non-music stations on our satellite radio service and to podcast talent based on advertising revenue for\nthe related channel or podcast. Revenue share on non-music channels and podcasts is recognized in Revenue share and\nroyalties in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income when it is earned. In some cases, we pay minimum\nguarantees for revenue share to podcast owners which is recorded in Prepaid and other current assets in our\nconsolidated balance sheets. The minimum guarantee is recognized in Revenue share and royalties primarily on a\nstraight line basis over the contractual term. The prepaid balance is regularly reviewed for recoverability and any amount\nnot deemed to be recoverable is recognized as an expense in the period.\nRoyalties\nIn connection with our businesses, we must enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders: holders of\nmusical compositions copyrights (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of sound recordings copyrights (that is, the\nactual recording of a work). Our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses use both statutory and direct music licenses as part\nof their businesses. We license varying rights - such as performance and mechanical rights—for use in our Sirius XM and\nPandora businesses based on the various radio and interactive services they offer. The music rights licensing\narrangements for our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses are complex.\nMusical Composition Copyrights\nWe pay performance royalties for our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses to holders and rights administrators of musical\ncompositions copyrights, including performing rights organizations and other copyright owners. These performance\nroyalties are based on agreements with performing rights organizations which represent the holders of these\nperformance rights. Our Sirius XM and Pandora businesses have arrangements with these performance rights\norganizations. Arrangements with Sirius XM generally include fixed payments during the term of the agreement and\narrangements with Pandora for its ad-supported radio service have variable payments based on usage and ownership of\na royalty pool.\nPandora must also license reproduction rights, which are also referred to as mechanical rights, to offer the interactive\nfeatures of the Pandora services. For our Pandora subscription services, copyright holders receive payments for these\nrights at the rates determined in accordance with the statutory license set forth in Section 115 of the United States\nCopyright Act. These mechanical royalties are calculated as the greater of a percentage of our revenue or a percentage\nof our payments to record labels.\nF-12\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-13\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nSound Recording Copyrights\nFor our non-interactive satellite radio or streaming services we may license sound recordings under direct licenses with\nthe owners of sound recordings or based on the royalty rate established by the CRB. For our Sirius XM business, the\nroyalty rate for sound recordings has been set by the CRB. The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue\nfrom our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers, and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels\nthat make only incidental performances of sound recordings. The rates and terms permit us to reduce the payment due\neach month for those sound recording directly licensed from copyright owners and exclude from our revenue certain\nother items, such as royalties paid to us for intellectual property, sales and use taxes, bad debt expense and generally\nrevenue attributable to areas of our business that do not involve the use of copyrighted sound recordings.\nFor our Pandora business, we have entered into direct license agreements with major and independent music labels and\ndistributors for a significant majority of the sound recordings that stream on the Pandora ad-supported service, Pandora\nPlus and Pandora Premium. For sound recordings that we stream and for which we have not entered into a direct\nlicense agreement with the sound recording rights holders, the sound recordings are streamed pursuant to the statutory\nroyalty rates set by the CRB. Pandora pays royalties to owners of sound recordings on either a per-performance fee\nbased on the number of sound recordings transmitted or a percentage of revenue associated with the applicable\nservice. Certain of these agreements also require Pandora to pay a per subscriber minimum amount.\nProgramming Costs\nProgramming costs which are for a specified number of events are amortized on an event-by-event basis; programming\ncosts which are for a specified season or include programming through a dedicated channel are amortized over the\nseason or period on a straight-line basis. We allocate a portion of certain programming costs which are related to\nsponsorship and marketing activities to Sales and marketing expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the\nagreement.\nAdvertising Costs\nMedia is expensed when aired and advertising production costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising production costs\ninclude expenses related to marketing and retention activities, including expenses related to direct mail, outbound\ntelemarketing and email communications. We also incur advertising production costs related to cooperative marketing\nand promotional events and sponsorships. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded\nadvertising costs of $513, $515 and $443, respectively. These costs are reflected in Sales and marketing expense in our\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nSubscriber Acquisition Costs\nSubscriber acquisition costs consist of costs incurred to acquire new subscribers which include hardware subsidies paid\nto radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers, including subsidies paid to automakers who include a satellite\nradio and a prepaid subscription to our service in the sale or lease price of a new vehicle; subsidies paid for chipsets and\ncertain other components used in manufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and chipsets; commissions\npaid to retailers and automakers as incentives to purchase, install and activate radios; product warranty obligations;\nfreight; and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to inventory consumed in our automotive and retail\ndistribution channels. Subscriber acquisition costs do not include advertising costs, loyalty payments to distributors and\ndealers of radios and revenue share payments to automakers and retailers of radios.\nSubsidies paid to radio manufacturers and automakers are expensed upon installation, shipment, receipt of product or\nactivation and are included in Subscriber acquisition costs because we are responsible for providing the service to the\ncustomers. Commissions paid to retailers and automakers are expensed upon either the sale or activation of radios.\nChipsets that are shipped to radio manufacturers and held on consignment are recorded as inventory and expensed as\nSubscriber acquisition costs when placed into production by radio manufacturers. Costs for chipsets are expensed as\nSubscriber acquisition costs when the automaker confirms receipt.\nF-13\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-14\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nResearch & Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include the cost of new product development,\nchipset design, software development and engineering. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nwe recorded research and development costs of $246, $229 and $220, respectively. These costs are reported as a\ncomponent of Engineering, design and development expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, net of tax\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) of $(4) was primarily comprised of the cumulative foreign currency translation\nadjustments related to Sirius XM Canada (refer to Note 12 for additional information). During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we recorded a net foreign currency translation adjustment of $(19), net of tax. During the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a foreign currency translation adjustment of less than $1 and $7,\nrespectively, net of tax.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Policies\nAccounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). In August 2020, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-06 which removes the separation models for convertible debt with cash\nconversion or beneficial conversion features. ASU 2020-06 also requires the application of the if-converted method for\ncalculating diluted earnings per share as the treasury stock method will no longer be permitted for convertible\ninstruments. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022 using\nthe modified retrospective approach and recorded a $14 increase to the carrying value of Pandora’s 1.75% Convertible\nSenior Notes due 2023 and an increase of $10, net of tax, to our accumulated deficit. The adoption of ASU 2020-06\ndid not have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share.\n(3) ACQUISITIONS\nOther acquisitions\nOn May 20, 2022, we completed an acquisition for total cash consideration of $93. We recognized goodwill of $69,\nindefinite-lived intangible assets of $1 and other long-term assets of $23. The other assets represent acquired content\nwhich will be amortized over its estimated useful life to Programming and content in our consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income.\nOn January 12, 2022, we completed an acquisition for total cash consideration of $43. We recognized goodwill of $29,\nother definite-lived intangible assets of $19 and liabilities of $4.\nOn April 23, 2021, we completed an acquisition for total consideration of $27 which included $20 in cash, a $3\ndeferred cash payment and $4 in restricted stock units. We recognized goodwill of $23 and other assets of $5.\nStitcher\nOn October 16, 2020, we acquired the assets of Stitcher from The E.W. Scripps Company and certain of its subsidiaries\n(“Scripps”) for total consideration of $302, which included $266 in cash and $36 related to contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a $17 benefit related to the change in fair value of the 2021\nportion of the contingent consideration related to the Stitcher transaction in Impairment, restructuring and acquisition\ncosts in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The fair value of the contingent consideration was\ndetermined using a probability-weighted cash flow model. Stitcher is included in our Pandora and Off-platform\nreporting unit.\nThe Stitcher acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and was financed through\nborrowings under Sirius XM’s Credit Facility.\nF-14\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-15\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nSimplecast\nOn June 16, 2020, Sirius XM acquired Simplecast for $28 in cash. Simplecast is a podcast management and analytics\nplatform. Simplecast complements AdsWizz’s advertising technology platform, allowing the company to offer\npodcasters a comprehensive solution for publishing, analytics, distribution and advertising sales, and is included in the\nPandora and Off-platform reporting unit. The Simplecast acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting. We recognized goodwill of $17, amortizable intangible assets of $12, other assets of less than $1 and\ndeferred tax liabilities of $1.\nAcquisition related costs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $2, $12 and $4, respectively.\n(4) FAIR vALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amounts of cash and cash\nequivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximated fair value due to the short-term nature of these\ninstruments. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a fair value hierarchy for input into\nvaluation techniques as follows:\ni. Level 1 input: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instrument;\nii. Level 2 input: observable market data for the same or similar instrument but not Level 1, including quoted prices\nfor identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can\nbe corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\niii. Level 3 input: unobservable inputs developed using management’s assumptions about the inputs used for pricing\nthe asset or liability.\nInvestments are periodically reviewed for impairment and an impairment is recorded whenever declines in fair value below\ncarrying value are determined to be other than temporary. In making this determination, we consider, among other\nfactors, the severity and duration of the decline as well as the likelihood of a recovery within a reasonable timeframe.\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair value\nLiabilities:\nDebt(a) — $8,362 — $8,362 — $9,052 — $9,052\n(a)The fair value for non-publicly traded instruments is based upon estimates from a market maker and brokerage firm. Refer to\nNote 13 for information related to the carrying value of our debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(5) RESTRUCTURING COSTS\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we evaluated our office space needs, and, as a result of such analysis, we\nvacated certain office spaces. We assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the operating lease right of use\nassets related to these locations. We determined that the carrying values of the assets were not recoverable, and we\nrecorded an impairment of $16 to reduce the carrying value of the assets to their fair values. Additionally, we wrote off\nfixed assets of $5 in connection with furniture and equipment located at the impaired office spaces. Separately, we\nperformed an analysis surrounding initiatives that we are no longer pursuing and recorded an impairment of $43\nassociated with terminated software projects and an impairment of $6 related to personnel severance. The total\nrestructuring and impairment charge of $70 was recorded to Impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs in our\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we evaluated our office space needs and, as a result of such analysis,\nsurrendered certain office leases. We assessed the recoverability of the carrying value of the operating lease right of use\nassets related to these locations. Based on that assessment, the carrying values of the assets were not recoverable, and\nF-15\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-16\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nwe recorded an impairment of $18 to reduce the carrying value of the assets to their fair values. Additionally, we\naccrued expenses of $6 for which we will not recognize any future economic benefits and wrote off leasehold\nimprovements of $1. The fair values of the assets were determined using a discounted cash flow model based on\nmanagement’s assumptions regarding the ability to sublease the locations and the remaining term of the leases. The\ntotal charge of $25 was recorded to Impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs in our consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $24 of restructuring expenses primarily related to the write\ndown of property and equipment, definite lived intangible assets and certain other assets related to the termination of\nthe Automatic service in Impairment, restructuring and acquisition costs in our consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income. The termination of the Automatic service did not meet the requirements to be reported as a\ndiscontinued operation in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income because the termination of the service\ndoes not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.\n(6) EARNINGS PER ShARE\nBasic net income per common share is calculated by dividing the income available to common stockholders by the\nweighted average common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted net income per common share\nadjusts the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if\ncommon stock equivalents (stock options, restricted stock units and convertible debt) were exercised or converted into\ncommon stock, calculated using the treasury stock method. We had no participating securities during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nCommon stock equivalents of $92, $93 and $62 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nwere excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nFo Yr etahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet Income available to common stockholders for basic net income per common share $1,213 $1,314 $ 131\nEffect of interest on assumed conversions of convertible notes, net of tax 4 8 8\nNet Income available to common stockholders for dilutive net income per common share $1,217 $1,322 $ 139\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic net income per common share 3,916 4,062 4,330\nWeighted average impact of assumed convertible notes 3 1 30 30\nWeighted average impact of dilutive equity instruments 4 3 51 69\nWeighted average shares for diluted net income per common share 3,990 4,143 4,429\nNet income per common share:\nBasic $ 0 . 3 1 $ 0.32 $ 0.03\nDiluted $ 0 . 3 1 $ 0.32 $ 0.03\n(7) RECEIvABLES, NET\nReceivables, net, includes customer accounts receivable, receivables from distributors and other receivables. We do not\nhave any customer receivables that individually represent more than ten percent of our receivables.\nCustomer accounts receivable, net, includes receivables from our subscribers and advertising customers, including\nadvertising agencies and other customers, and is stated at amounts due, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our\nallowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of various factors. We consider historical experience, the\nage of the receivable balances, current economic conditions, industry experience and other factors that may affect the\ncounterparty’s ability to pay. Bad debt expense is included in Customer service and billing expense in our consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income.\nF-16\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-17\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nReceivables from distributors primarily include billed and unbilled amounts due from automakers for services included in\nthe sale or lease price of vehicles, as well as billed amounts due from wholesale distributors of our satellite radios. Other\nreceivables primarily include amounts due from manufacturers of our radios, modules and chipsets where we are\nentitled to subsidies and royalties based on the number of units produced. We have not established an allowance for\ndoubtful accounts for our receivables from distributors or other receivables as we have historically not experienced any\nsignificant collection issues with automakers or other third parties and do not expect issues in the foreseeable future.\nReceivables, net, consists of the following:\nDecemb 2e0r2 321 , December 31, 2021\nGross customer accounts receivable $5 8 5 $636\nAllowance for doubtful accounts ( 1 1 ) (10)\nCustomer accounts receivable, net $5 7 4 $626\nReceivables from distributors 5 3 62\nOther receivables 2 8 34\nTotal receivables, net $ 6 5 5 $722\n(8) GOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable\nintangible assets acquired in business combinations. Our annual impairment assessment of our two reporting units is\nperformed as of the fourth quarter of each year, and an assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying\namount. ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, states that an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill\nimpairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment\ncharge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Our Sirius XM reporting\nunit, which has an allocated goodwill balance of $2,290, had a negative carrying amount as of December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of impairment, and no impairment losses were recorded for\ngoodwill during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we elected\nto perform a quantitative goodwill assessment of our Pandora and Off-platform reporting unit and determined the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit using a combination of an income approach, employing a discounted cash flow model, and\na market approach. The results of our 2022 goodwill impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of our\nPandora and Off-platform reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we performed a quantitative goodwill assessment and determined the fair\nvalue of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach, employing a discounted cash flow model, and\na market approach. The discounted cash flow model relied on assumptions, such as the extent of the economic\ndownturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the expected timing of recovery, expected growth in profitability and\ndiscount rate, which we believed were appropriate. Additionally, assumptions related to guideline company financial\nmultiples used in the market approach decreased based on market observations. The results of our 2020 goodwill\nimpairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the Sirius XM reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.\nThe carrying amount of the Pandora and Off-platform reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value primarily due to a\nreduction in the long-term forecast to reflect increased costs related to royalty rates for streaming and increased\nuncertainty surrounding the projected demand for advertising and decrease of listening hours.

Our annual impairment assessment of our identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets is performed as of\nthe fourth quarter of each year. An assessment is performed at other times if an event occurs or circumstances change\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value. If the carrying value of the\nintangible assets exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe completed a quantitative assessment of our FCC licenses and Pandora trademarks during the fourth quarter of\n2022. As of the date of our annual assessment for 2022, our impairment assessment of the fair value of our indefinite\nintangible assets indicated that the estimated fair value of our FCC licenses and Pandora trademarks exceeded their\ncarrying values and therefore no impairment exists.\nWe completed our qualitative assessments of our FCC licenses and XM and Pandora trademarks during the fourth\nquarter of 2021. As of the date of our annual assessment, our qualitative impairment assessment of the fair value of\nour indefinite intangible assets indicated that the fair value of such assets exceeded their carrying value and therefore\nwere not at risk of impairment.\nWe completed a quantitative assessment of our FCC licenses and XM and Pandora trademarks during the fourth\nquarter of 2020. As of the date of our annual assessment for 2020, our impairment assessment of the fair value of our\nindefinite intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of our Pandora trademark exceeded the fair value of the\nasset by $20. The excess carrying value was written off and recognized in the Impairment, restructuring and acquisition\ncosts line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The impairment assessment for our FCC\nlicenses and XM trademark indicate that the fair value of such assets substantially exceeded their carrying value and\ntherefore were not at risk of impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we also recognized an\nimpairment loss of less than $1 for intangible assets with indefinite lives related to the termination of the Automatic\nservice.\nDefinite Life Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual\nvalues, in a pattern that reflects when the economic benefits will be consumed, and are reviewed for impairment under\nthe provisions of ASC 360-10-35, Property, Plant and Equipment/Overall/Subsequent Measurement. We review\nintangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest,\nis less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which the carrying\namount of the asset exceeds its fair value. No impairment loss was recognized for intangible assets with definite lives\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAmortization expense for all definite life intangible assets was $156, $154 and $152 for the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no retirements of definite lived intangible assets during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021.

Recoverability of assets to be held and used is\nmeasured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows\nexpected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an\nimpairment charge is recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. During\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $48 related to the write off of terminated\nsoftware projects and fixed assets in connection with furniture and equipment located at impaired office spaces. Refer\nto the Note 5 for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an impairment charge of $220 related to our SXM-7 satellite\nwhich was offset by insurance recoveries.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to value stock option awards and have elected to treat\nawards with graded vesting as a single award. Share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the\nrequisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We measure restricted stock unit awards using the fair\nmarket value of the restricted shares of common stock on the day the award is granted. We measure the value of\nrestricted units that will vest depending a relative total stockholder return metric – that is, the performance of our\ncommon stock as compared other companies included in the S&P 500 Index – using a special option-based valuation\nmethod, known as a Monte Carlo simulation. Since the results of such awards depend on future results, which are not\nknown on the grant date, the Monte Carlo simulation attempts to take into consideration the terms of the awards,\npotential future returns, payout rates, and other factors to estimate a fair value of the award. The Monte Carlo\nsimulation method uses factual data for the company and employs various assumptions. Stock-based awards granted to\nemployees, non-employees and members of our board of directors include stock options and restricted stock units.\nFair value as determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model varies based on assumptions used for the expected life,\nexpected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rates. For the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2021 and 2020, we estimated the fair value of awards granted using the hybrid approach for volatility, which\nweights observable historical volatility and implied volatility of qualifying actively traded options on our common stock.\nThe expected life assumption represents the weighted-average period stock-based awards are expected to remain\noutstanding. These expected life assumptions are established through a review of historical exercise behavior of stock-\nbased award grants with similar vesting periods. Where historical patterns do not exist for non-employees, contractual\nterms are used. Dividend yield is based on the current expected annual dividend per share and our stock price. The risk-\nfree interest rate represents the daily treasury yield curve rate at the grant date based on the closing market bid yields on\nactively traded U.S. treasury securities in the over-the-counter market for the expected term. Our assumptions may\nchange in future periods.\n2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan\nIn May 2015, our stockholders approved the Sirius XM Holdings Inc. 2015 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the\n“2015 Plan”). Employees, consultants and members of our board of directors are eligible to receive awards under the\n2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and\nother stock-based awards that the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors deems appropriate. Stock-based\nawards granted under the 2015 Plan are generally subject to a graded vesting requirement, which is generally three to\nfour years from the grant date. Stock options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units\ninclude performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”), the vesting of which are subject to the achievement of\nperformance goals and the employee’s continued employment and generally cliff vest on the third anniversary of the\ngrant date. Each restricted stock unit entitles the holder to receive one share of common stock upon vesting. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, 122 shares of common stock were available for future grants under the 2015 Plan.\nThe Compensation Committee intends to award equity-based compensation to our senior management in the form of:\n25% stock options, which awards will vest in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant;\n25% restricted stock units, which awards will vest in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of\ngrant; 25% PRSUs, which will cliff vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant after a two-year performance\nperiod if the free cash flow target established by the Compensation Committee is achieved; and 25% PRSUs, which will\ncliff vest after a three-year performance period based on the performance of our common stock relative to the\ncompanies included in the S&P 500 Index. We refer to this performance measure as a relative “TSR” or “total\nstockholder return” metric. PRSUs based on the relative total stockholder return metric will only vest if our performance\nachieves at least the 25th percentile, with a target payout requiring performance at the 50th percentile.

Employer matching contributions\nunder the Sirius XM Plan vest at a rate of 33.33% for each year of employment and are fully vested after three years of\nemployment for all current and future contributions. Our cash employer matching contributions are not used to\npurchase shares of our common stock on the open market, unless the employee elects our common stock as their\ninvestment option for this contribution.\nWe recognized expenses of $19, $21 and $16 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in\nconnection with the Sirius XM Plan.\nSirius XM Holdings Inc.

Pursuant to the terms of the DCP, we may elect to make additional\ncontributions beyond amounts deferred by participants, but we are under no obligation to do so. We have established a\ngrantor (or “rabbi”) trust to facilitate the payment of our obligations under the DCP.\nContributions to the DCP, net of withdrawals, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $(1), $4\nand $8, respectively.

Under the terms of\nthese agreements, our obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements.\nIn certain of these agreements, the future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to\nestimate; therefore, they are not included in our minimum contractual cash commitments.\nSales and marketing.We have entered into various marketing, sponsorship and distribution agreements to promote our\nbrands and are obligated to make payments to sponsors, retailers, automakers, radio manufacturers and other third\nparties under these agreements. Certain programming and content agreements also require us to purchase advertising\non properties owned or controlled by the licensors.\nSatellite incentive payments.Maxar Technologies (formerly Space Systems/Loral), the manufacturer of certain of our\nin-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit performance payments upon XM-5, SIRIUS FM-5, SIRIUS FM-6, and\nSXM-8 meeting their fifteen-year design life, which we expect to occur.\nOperating lease obligations.We have entered into both cancelable and non-cancelable operating leases for office space,\nterrestrial repeaters, data centers and equipment. These leases provide for minimum lease payments, additional\noperating expense charges, leasehold improvements and rent escalations that have initial terms ranging from one to\nfifteen years, and certain leases have options to renew. Total rent recognized in connection with leases for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $68, $69 and $73, respectively.\nRoyalties, Minimum Guarantees and Other.We have entered into music royalty arrangements that include fixed\npayments. In addition, certain of our podcast agreements also contain minimum guarantees. As of December 31, 2022,\nwe had future fixed commitments related to music royalty and podcast agreements of $484, of which $217 will be paid\nin 2023 and the remainder will be paid thereafter. On a quarterly basis, we record the greater of the cumulative actual\ncontent costs incurred or the cumulative minimum guarantee based on forecasted usage for the minimum guarantee\nperiod. The minimum guarantee period is the period of time that the minimum guarantee relates to, as specified in\neach agreement, which may be annual or a longer period. The cumulative minimum guarantee, based on forecasted\nusage, considers factors such as listening hours, downloads, revenue, subscribers and other terms of each agreement\nthat impact our expected attainment or recoupment of the minimum guarantees based on the relative attribution\nmethod.\nSeveral of our content agreements also include provisions related to the royalty payments and structures of those\nagreements relative to other content licensing arrangements, which, if triggered, cause our payments under those\nagreements to escalate. In addition, record labels, publishers and performing rights organizations with whom we have\nentered into direct license agreements have the right to audit our content payments, and such audits often result in\ndisputes over whether we have paid the proper content costs.\nWe have also entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes. The cost of our\ncommon stock acquired in our capital return program but not paid for as of December 31, 2022 was also included in\nthis category.\nIn addition to the minimum contractual cash commitments described above, we have entered into other variable cost\narrangements. These future costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to anticipate; however, these costs\nmay be substantial. We may enter into additional programming, distribution, marketing and other agreements that\ncontain similar variable cost provisions. We do not have any other significant off-balance sheet financing arrangements\nthat are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital\nexpenditures or capital resources.\nF-32\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-33\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nLegal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant or party to various claims and lawsuits, including those discussed\nbelow.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can\nbe reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has\nbeen previously accrued and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both\nprobability and the estimated amount of a loss or potential loss. We may be unable to reasonably estimate the\nreasonably possible loss or range of loss for a particular legal contingency for various reasons, including, among others,\nbecause: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the relative early stages; (iii) there is\nuncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings (including motions and appeals); (iv) there is uncertainty as to the\nlikelihood of settlement and the outcome of any negotiations with respect thereto; (v) there remain significant factual\nissues to be determined or resolved; (vi) the relevant law is unsettled; or (vii) the proceedings involve novel or untested\nlegal theories. In such instances, there may be considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such\nmatters, including the likelihood or magnitude of a possible eventual loss, if any.\nPre-1972 Sound Recording Litigation.On October 2, 2014, Flo & Eddie Inc. filed a class action suit against Pandora in\nthe federal district court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges a violation of California Civil Code\nSection 980, unfair competition, misappropriation and conversion in connection with the public performance of sound\nrecordings recorded prior to February 15, 1972 (which we refer to as, “pre-1972 recordings”). On December 19, 2014,\nPandora filed a motion to strike the complaint pursuant to California’s Anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation\n(“Anti-SLAPP”) statute, which following denial of Pandora’s motion was appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn March 2017, the Ninth Circuit requested certification to the California Supreme Court on the substantive legal\nquestions. The California Supreme Court accepted certification. In May 2019, the California Supreme Court issued an\norder dismissing consideration of the certified questions on the basis that, following the enactment of the Orrin G.\nHatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-264, 132 Stat. 3676 (2018) (the “MMA”), resolution\nof the questions posed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was no longer “necessary to…settle an important\nquestion of law.”\nThe MMA grants a potential federal preemption defense to the claims asserted in the aforementioned lawsuits. In\nJuly 2019, Pandora took steps to avail itself of this preemption defense, including making the required payments under\nthe MMA for certain of its uses of pre-1972 recordings. Based on the federal preemption contained in the MMA (along\nwith other considerations), Pandora asked the Ninth Circuit to order the dismissal of the Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Pandora\nMedia, Inc.case. On October 17, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a memorandum disposition\nconcluding that the question of whether the MMA preempts Flo and Eddie’s claims challenging Pandora’s performance\nof pre-1972 recordings “depends on various unanswered factual questions” and remanded the case to the District\nCourt for further proceedings.\nIn October 2020, the District Court denied Pandora’s renewed motion to dismiss the case under California’s anti-SLAPP\nstatute, finding the case no longer qualified for anti-SLAPP due to intervening changes in the law, and denied Pandora’s\nrenewed attempt to end the case. Alternatively, the District Court ruled that the preemption defense likely did not apply\nto Flo & Eddie’s claims, in part because the District Court believed that the MMA did not apply retroactively. Pandora\npromptly appealed the District Court’s decision to the Ninth Circuit, and moved to stay appellate briefing pending the\nappeal of a related case against Sirius XM. On January 13, 2021, the Ninth Circuit issued an order granting the stay of\nappellate proceedings pending the resolution of a related case against Sirius XM.\nOn August 23, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued an Opinion in a related case, Flo &\nEddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.The related case also concerned a class action suit brought by Flo & Eddie Inc.\nregarding the public performance of pre-1972 recordings under California law. Relying on California’s copyright statute,\nFlo & Eddie argued that California law gave it the “exclusive ownership” of its pre-1972 songs, including the right of\npublic performance. The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court’s grant of partial summary judgment to Flo & Eddie Inc.\nThe Ninth Circuit held that the District Court in this related case erred in concluding that “exclusive ownership” under\nCalifornia’s copyright statute included the right of public performance. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case for entry of\njudgment consistent with the terms of the parties’ contingent settlement agreement, and on October 6, 2021, the\nF-33\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-34\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nparties to the related case stipulated to its dismissal with prejudice. The Flo & Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.decision is\nprecedential in the Ninth Circuit, and therefore we believe substantially narrows the claims that Flo & Eddie may\ncontinue to assert against Pandora.\nFollowing issuance of the Flo & Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc.opinion, on September 3, 2021, the Ninth Circuit lifted\nthe stay of appellate proceedings in Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Pandora Media, LLC. Pandora promptly filed an appeal of the\nDistrict Court’s order denying the renewed motion to dismiss the case under California’s anti-SLAAP statute.\nOn June 2, 2022, the Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court’s order denying dismissal of the case under California’s anti-\nSLAPP statute, finding that Pandora had failed to demonstrate that Flo & Eddie’s claims arise from Pandora’s protected\nconduct. As part of the decision, the Ninth Circuit noted that Pandora had forcefully argued that the Court’s decision in\nFlo & Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio Inc., and other decisions under New York, Florida and Georgia law, foreclosed Flo &\nEddie’s claims as a matter of law. Because the case has been pending for over seven years, the Ninth Circuit remanded\nthe case to the District Court and directed “the district court to consider expedited motions practice on the legal validity\nof Flo & Eddie’s claims in light of the intervening precedent.”\nOn September 29, 2022, Flo & Eddie filed an Amended Complaint, and on October 13, 2022, Pandora filed an Answer\nto the Amended Complaint. In accordance with the directive of the Ninth Circuit, the parties have agreed to a schedule\nfor a Motion for Summary Judgment. In November 2022, Pandora filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and briefing\non this Motion is expected to be completed in February 2023.\nOther Matters.In the ordinary course of business, we are a defendant in various other lawsuits and arbitration\nproceedings, including derivative actions; actions filed by subscribers, both on behalf of themselves and on a class action\nbasis; former employees; parties to contracts or leases; and owners of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other\nintellectual property. None of these other matters, in our opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\n(17) INCOME TAxES\nCurrent federal income tax expense or benefit represents the amounts expected to be reported on our income tax\nreturn, and deferred income tax expense or benefits represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases\nof assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted income tax rates that will be in effect when these differences\nreverse. The current state income tax provision is primarily related to taxable income in certain states that have\nsuspended or limited the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards or where net operating losses have been fully\nutilized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe have historically filed a consolidated federal income tax return for all of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including\nSirius XM and Pandora. On February 1, 2021, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with Liberty Media governing\nthe allocation of consolidated U.S. income tax liabilities and setting forth agreements with respect to other tax matters.\nThe tax sharing agreement contains provisions that we believe are customary for tax sharing agreements between\nmembers of a consolidated group. On November 3, 2021, Liberty Media informed us that it beneficially owned over\n80% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, resulting in our inclusion in the 2021 consolidated tax return of\nLiberty Media. The tax sharing agreement and our inclusion in Liberty Media’s consolidated tax group is not expected to\nhave any material adverse effect on us. We have calculated the provision for income taxes by using a separate\nreturn method.\nOur current tax expense is the amount of tax payable on the basis of a hypothetical, current-year separate return. We\nprovided deferred taxes on temporary differences and on any carryforwards that we could claim on our hypothetical\nreturn and assess the need for a valuation allowance on the basis of our projected separate return results. Any\ndifference between the tax expense (or benefit) allocated to us under the separate return method and payments to be\nmade for (or received from) Liberty Media for tax expense are treated as either dividends or capital contributions.\nF-34\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-35\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following:\nFo Yr etahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021 2020\nCurrent taxes:\nFederal $(1 4 0 ) $ (31) $ —\nState ( 5 0 ) (50) (61)\nTotal current taxes (1 9 0 ) (81) (61)\nDeferred taxes:\nFederal ( 1 6 3 ) (210) (219)\nState ( 3 9 ) 79 (19)\nTotal deferred taxes (2 0 2 ) (131) (238)\nTotal income tax expense $(3 9 2 ) $(212) $(299)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our effective tax rate:\nFo Yr etahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021 2020\nFederal tax expense, at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income tax expense, net of federal benefit 4.1 % 4.1 % 4.2 %\nChange in valuation allowance 2.2 % 1.5 % 0.7 %\nTax credits (1.5 ) % (4.7)% (10.2)%\nShare-based compensation (0.8 ) % (1.0)% (3.5)%\nImpact of nondeductible compensation 0.8 % 0.6 % 2.6 %\nAutomatic worthless stock deduction — % — % (3.5)%\nGoodwill impairment — % — % 53.7 %\nUncertain tax positions (0.8 ) % (0.1)% 4.4 %\nAudit Settlements — % (7.6)% — %\nOther, net (0.6 ) % 0.1 % 0.1 %\nEffective tax rate 24.4 % 13.9 % 69.5 %\nOur effective tax rate of 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily impacted by federal and state\nincome tax expense as well as changes in state valuation allowance, partially offset by a benefit related to research and\ndevelopment and certain other credits. Our effective tax rate of 13.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\nprimarily impacted by federal and state income tax expense, partially offset by settlements with various states as well as\na benefit related to research and development and certain other credits. Our effective tax rate of 69.5% for the year\nended December 31, 2020 was primarily impacted by the nondeductible Pandora goodwill impairment charge, partially\noffset by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, a benefit related to state and\nfederal research and development and certain other credits and a worthless stock deduction associated with the\ntermination of the Automatic service.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying\namount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-\nend, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected\nto affect taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future\ntaxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences can be carried forward under tax law. Our\nevaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets considers both positive and negative evidence, including historical\nfinancial performance, scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected taxable income and tax\nF-35\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-36\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nplanning strategies. The weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to\nwhich it can be objectively verified. A valuation allowance is recognized when, based on the weight of all available\nevidence, it is considered more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax\nliabilities, shown before jurisdictional netting, are presented below:\nFo Yre tahres Ended December 31,\n2 0 2 2 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards and tax credits $4 05 $ 681\nDeferred revenue 4 5 52\nAccrued bonus 2 8 35\nExpensed costs capitalized for tax 6 6 9\nInvestments 2 3 20\nStock based compensation 5 4 57\nOperating lease liability 9 4 104\nOther 1 7 12\nTotal deferred tax assets 7 3 2 970\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation of property and equipment (20 6 ) (286)\nFCC license ( 5 2 0 ) (522)\nOther intangible assets (2 3 4 ) (263)\nRight of use asset ( 7 7 ) (89)\nOther — (5)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (1,0 3 7 ) (1,165)\nNet deferred tax assets before valuation allowance (30 5 ) (195)\nValuation allowance ( 1 1 3 ) (83)\nTotal net deferred tax (liability) asset ( 4$1 8) $ (278)\nNet operating loss carryforwards and tax credits decreased as a result of the utilization of net operating losses related to\ncurrent year taxable income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded $25 and $71 for state\nand federal tax credits, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our gross federal net operating loss carryforwards were\napproximately $423 which are subject to Section 382 limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of $113 and $83,\nrespectively, that were not likely to be realized due to the timing of certain federal and state net operating loss\nlimitations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our valuation allowance increased primarily as a result of the\nimpact of decrease in forecasted earnings, resulting in lower projected utilization of state and local net operating losses.\nThis was partially offset by a write off of a valuation allowance that was recorded on net operating losses that expired\nduring the current year. As a portion of these net operating losses are not anticipated to be realizable, we increased our\nvaluation allowance for those expected to expire un-utilized based on taxable income projections.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will\nbe sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the\nposition and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more likely than not\nthreshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be\nrealized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority. If the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained,\nthe gross amount of the unrecognized tax position will not be recorded in the financial statements but will be shown in\ntabular format within the uncertain income tax positions. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the\nperiod in which the change in judgment occurs due to the following conditions: (1) the tax position is “more likely than\nF-36\n2022 ANNUAL REPORT\n105679_04_Sirius_AR.qxp_01 4/14/23 9:15 AM Page F-37\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Continued\n(Dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts)\nnot” to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation,\nor (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax\nposition is effectively settled or until there is a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations. We record interest and\npenalties related to uncertain tax positions in Income tax expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits and uncertain tax positions of $198 and $179,\nrespectively. If recognized, $198 of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate. Uncertain tax positions\nare recognized in Other long-term liabilities which, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, were $81 and $35, respectively,\nincluding accrued interest.\nWe have state income tax audits pending. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of these audits to have a material\nadverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. We also do not currently anticipate that our existing\nreserves related to uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 will significantly increase or decrease during the\nyear ending December 31, 2023. Various events could cause our current expectations to change. Should our position\nwith respect to the majority of these uncertain tax positions be upheld, the effect would be recorded in our\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income as part of the income tax provision. We recorded interest expense of\n$(3) and $1 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits.\nChanges in our unrecognized tax benefits and uncertain tax positions from January 1 through December 31 are set\nforth below:\n2 0 2 2 2021\nBalance, beginning of year $ 1 7 9 $ 433\nIncreases in tax positions for prior years 3 9\nIncreases in tax positions for current year 3 1 13\nDecreases in tax positions for prior years ( 1 5 ) (24)\nDecreases related to settlement with taxing authorities — (252)\nBalance, end of year $ 1 9 8 $ 179\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA\nimposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, levies a 1% excise\ntax on net stock repurchases after December 31, 2022, and provides tax incentives to promote clean energy. Beginning\nin 2023, our net stock repurchases will be subject to the excise tax. Based on the historical net repurchase activity, the\nexcise tax and the other provisions of the IRA are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or\nfinancial position.\n(18) SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPhIC INFORMATION\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, we disaggregate our operations into two reportable\nsegments: Sirius XM and Pandora and Off-platform. The financial results of these segments are utilized by the chief\noperating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, for evaluating segment performance and allocating\nresources. We report our segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach\ndesignates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source\nof our reportable segments. For additional information on our segments refer to Note 1.\nSegment results include the revenues and cost of services which are directly attributable to each segment. There are no\nindirect revenues or costs incurred that are allocated to the segments. There are planned intersegment advertising\ncampaigns which will be eliminated.
