(Nasdaq: [ORMP](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oramed-letter-to-shareholders-302183192.html#financial-modal)) (TASE: ORMP) (“Oramed”) ([www.oramed.com](http://www.oramed.com/)), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery platforms, today issued a Letter to Shareholders from its Chief Executive Officer, Nadav Kidron.\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nIn light of our recent announcement regarding Oramed’s $20 million stock repurchase program, we believe this is an opportune moment to provide our shareholders with a comprehensive update on our activities and progress. As this development demonstrates our confidence in Oramed’s value and potential, we felt it was important to contextualize this decision within the broader landscape of our ongoing initiatives and future plans. This letter serves to offer you insights into our current position, strategic direction, and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead for Oramed. We remain committed to transparent communication and are pleased to share this overview with you.\n\n**Scilex Senior Secured Note**\n\nThe repayment schedule from Scilex Holding Company for its Senior Secured Note commenced on December 21, 2023, with fixed installments due quarterly. As of today, Oramed has received $40 million out of the total $102 million principal (excluding interest and exit fees). This represents a significant portion of the expected returns from this strategic investment. The next milestone in this repayment plan is a $20 million installment, scheduled for September of this year.\n\n**Phase 3 Oral Insulin Program**\n\nOramed has proactively engaged in constructive dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding a new Phase 3 protocol. This refined approach is strategically focused on specific patient subgroups identified as significant responders through comprehensive analysis of both Phase 2 and Phase 3 data. By leveraging these insights, we aim to optimize the potential for success in our potential upcoming trial. This adaptive strategy underscores our commitment to advancing oral insulin therapy and potentially addressing a critical unmet need in diabetes management.\n\n**Oramed-HTIT Joint Venture Update**\n\nOramed and its long-term partner, Hefei Tianhui Biotech Co., Ltd. (HTIT), are finalizing the formation of a joint venture (JV) centered around Oramed’s cutting-edge oral drug delivery technology. The U.S.-based JV will focus on developing, marketing, and commercializing innovative products from Oramed’s oral insulin and POD™ (Protein Oral Delivery) pipeline, leveraging HTIT’s advanced manufacturing capabilities.\n\nThe JV will receive a significant capital infusion, with HTIT committing $70 million in cash and Oramed investing $25 million in cash and stock. These funds are strategically allocated to support the successful completion of the Phase 3 trial in the U.S., along with other crucial clinical and business activities. Furthermore, we are exploring strategies with HTIT to capitalize on their production capabilities and the expected launch of oral insulin sales.\n\nWhile synergies exist, the proposed transactions are complex, and there is no certainty that we will be able to close on any or all of them. We will keep you informed as progress is made.\n\nIn summary, Oramed maintains a strong cash position, bolstered by solid progress on the Scilex note transaction. We are making strides towards initiating a new Phase 3 trial for our oral insulin program while actively pursuing the joint venture opportunity with HTIT. These strategic initiatives position us to drive significant shareholder value. Thank you for your continued support as we work diligently to achieve major milestones. We look forward to providing updates on our progress.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNadav KidronChief Executive Officer\n\n**About Oramed Pharmaceuticals**\n\nOramed Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq/TASE: ORMP) is a platform technology pioneer in the field of oral delivery solutions for drugs currently delivered via injection.

(Nasdaq: ORMP) (TASE: ORMP) ([www.oramed.com](http://www.oramed.com/)), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral drug delivery platforms, today issued a Letter to Shareholders from its President and Chief Executive Officer, Nadav Kidron.\n\n![Oramed Logo](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/82lU_SyYLAZ5RKNIqOC9_Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQwNztjZj13ZWJw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/2a05b36fe8febaad979a185767d450a9)\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to share with you an update regarding Oramed. Despite the unexpected negative results we received for our U.S. based Phase 3 trial at the outset of last year, I am happy to report that we stand today on solid ground with many opportunities through which we seek to increase shareholder value.\n\n**Oramed’s Chinese Partner, HTIT, Successfully Completed Phase 3 Trial and Advances Production Facilities:**\n\nHefei Tianhui Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (“HTIT”), a strategic partner of Oramed, achieved a noteworthy milestone by successfully completing its Phase 3 trials of oral insulin for type 2 diabetes in China, currently in the final stages of regulatory approval.\n\nIn addition, HTIT has made substantial investments in facilities to enable commercial-scale production of the oral insulin capsule. This development underscores our belief in HTIT’s commitment to advancing the accessibility of innovative oral insulin solutions for patients in China and potentially beyond, as evidenced by the proposed Joint Venture described below.\n\n**Phase 3 Oral Insulin Program:**\n\nIn January 2023, Oramed announced that its U.S.-based, Phase 3 oral insulin trial for the treatment of type 2 diabetes did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Oramed has since completed an in-depth review of the trial data and the analysis found that subpopulations of patients with specific parameters, such as body mass index (BMI), baseline HbA1c, and age responded well to oral insulin. These subsets exhibited an over 1% placebo adjusted, statistically significant, reduction in HbA1c and closely approximate the patient population in the HTIT trials.\n\nWe are encouraged by the results of our analysis and have begun discussions with the FDA. We intend to initiate a Phase 3 oral insulin trial in the U.S. under a differentiated protocol that aligns with this positive data later this year.\n\n**Oramed and HTIT Joint Venture:**\n\nIn January 2024, Oramed entered into a definitive agreement with HTIT, marking a milestone in the creation of a joint venture (“JV”), centered around Oramed’s cutting-edge oral drug delivery technology. The JV is poised to be a dynamic force, focusing on the development, marketing, and global commercialization of innovative products derived from Oramed’s oral insulin and POD™ (Protein Oral Delivery) pipeline. This strategic partnership will harness HTIT’s advanced manufacturing capabilities and technologies.\n\nThe joint venture will receive a significant capital infusion, with HTIT committing a notable $70 million investment, supplemented by a $20 million investment from Oramed (comprised of $10 million in cash and $10 million in shares of Oramed common stock). This robust financial foundation is intended to help with the completion of clinical trials in the United States and to support various clinical and business activities crucial to the venture’s overall success. Additionally, we are exploring further strategies with HTIT to leverage their top-of-the-line production capabilities and capitalize on the expected launch of oral insulin sales in China. While there are evident synergies and logical collaborations on many levels, the proposed transactions contemplated by the JV are intricate and are still in process. There is no certainty that we will be able to close some or all of these transactions. We will keep you informed as we make progress in this regard.\n\n**Scilex Senior Secured Note:**\n\nIn September 2023, Scilex Holding Company (“Scilex”) issued an 18-month Senior Secured Promissory Note to Oramed (the “Note”), carrying an initial principal balance of $101,875,000 and an interest rate of SOFR plus 8.5% (currently ~13.8%). Oramed secured a senior lien on nearly all assets of Scilex and its subsidiaries as collateral for the Note. Concurrently, Scilex granted Oramed new warrants for up to 13 million shares of Scilex common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, subject to vesting as well as certain ownership and other restrictions. Repayment of the principal balance began on December 21, 2023, with fixed increments due every three months thereafter. In addition, a failure to fully repay the Note by March 21, 2024, triggers an exit fee of $3,056,250 upon full repayment.\n\n**Peritech Asset Acquisition and Strategic Out-Licensing:**\n\nIn December 2023, Oramed executed and completed an agreement with PeriTech Pharma Ltd. (“PeriTech”), acquiring the rights to their cutting-edge film-forming technology tailored for the delivery of topical/dermatology agents. This includes a once-daily over-the-counter treatment for hemorrhoids, surpassing existing market alternatives. The PeriTech pipeline extends its potential applications to include indications such as pruritus ani, anal warts, anal fissures and herpes labialis.\n\nIn emphasizing the potential benefits of this acquisition, Oramed has entered into an exclusive Licensing Agreement with an international consumer product and pharmaceutical group, pursuant to which Oramed granted the development and commercialization rights to the PeriTech pipeline in exchange for a royalty based on net sales.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)\n\nOramed Pharmaceuticals has posted encouraging phase 2 results for its oral insulin candidate designed to treat diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The company now awaits phase 3 readouts for the candidate that holds potential to become the first commercial oral insulin capsule for treating diabetes. \n\nThe double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the safety and efficacy of Oramed’s candidate—dubbed ORMD-0801—among 30 patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH, according to a Sept. 13 [release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oramed-reports-positive-top-line-results-from-phase-2-nash-trial-with-its-ormd-0801-oral-insulin-candidate-301623054.html). The 12-week trial results found ORMD-0801 to be safe and well tolerated at an 8 mg twice daily dosing, achieving the trial’s main target with no difference in adverse events for ORMD-0801 compared to placebo.\n\nThe trial also found several independent measures demonstrated a “consistent clinically meaningful trend” that favored ORMD-0801 for reducing liver fat content.\n\n“These results paint an exciting picture for the potential of our oral insulin candidate to treat patients with both diabetes and NASH, a very serious condition with few treatment options,” said Oramed CEO Nadav Kidron.\n\n### RELATED\n\n[The NASH curse strikes again. Pfizer dumps early-stage asset for liver condition](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/nash-curse-strikes-again-pfizer-dumps-early-stage-asset-liver-condition)\n\nThe New York-based company now awaits top-line readouts from two pivotal phase 3 trials assessing ORMD-0801, one of which is anticipated for January 2023, according to Kidron. \n\nIn addition to its lead candidate ORMD-0801, Oramed is also developing an oral GLP-1 analog capsule called ORMD-0901 that is in a phase 1 trial for diabetes.\n\nThe NASH landscape is a bleak one, with several big names hitting roadblocks in recent months. In July, Pfizer [dumped](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/nash-curse-strikes-again-pfizer-dumps-early-stage-asset-liver-condition) its early-stage asset danuglipron, a GLP-1 agonist also known as PF-06882961.\n\n​Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has been working to bring semaglutide—the GLP-1 molecule behind the company’s leading marketed trio of Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy—into the world of NASH. However, the Danish big pharma revealed in June that the drug failed to match placebo in a phase 2 study. Nevertheless, the company stands behind it, awaiting results from a separate phase 3 trial targeting NASH patients who’ve already advanced beyond the disease’s non-fibrotic stages.\n\n### RELATED\n\n[Oramed hits midstage target in oral insulin trial](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/oramed-hits-midstage-target-oral-insulin-trial)\n\nIn August, Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen [told Fierce Pharma](https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/once-and-future-glp-1-king-novo-nordisk-ceo-talks-wegovy-manufacturing-and-alzheimers) that while the ambitions are among Novo’s “most risky” R&D endeavors, the payoff for patients could be “tremendous.”\n\n“NASH is not an easy place to go,” Jørgensen acknowledged. “Honestly, not a lot of it has come out positive,” the CEO said of other industry efforts.\n\n[PrevPreviousBenzinga: This Company Says Its Developing a COVID-19 Vaccine That Can be Taken Orally ](https://oramed.com/benzinga-this-company-says-its-developing-a-covid-19-vaccine-that-can-be-taken-orally/)\n\n[NextSeeking Alpha: Oramed oral COVID vaccine shows promise in phase 1 trialNext](https://oramed.com/seeking-alpha-oramed-oral-covid-vaccine-shows-promise-in-phase-1-trial/)\n\n### You may also be interested\n\n##### [Stock News Now (video): Oramed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. – Developing Platform Technology for Oral Delivery of Drugs with Focus on Diabetes](https://oramed.com/stock-news-now-video-oramed-pharmaceuticals-inc-developing-platform-technology-for-oral-delivery-of-drugs-with-focus-on-diabetes/)\n\n  * [ November 11, 2015 ](https://oramed.com/2015/11/11/)\n\n\n\n[In the News](https://oramed.com/category/in-the-news/)\n\n[ ](https://oramed.com/stock-news-now-video-oramed-pharmaceuticals-inc-developing-platform-technology-for-oral-delivery-of-drugs-with-focus-on-diabetes/)\n\n##### [Seeking Alpha: $50 Million Plus Royalties Deal Indicates Bright Future For Oramed’s Oral Insulin](https://oramed.com/seeking-alpha-50-million-plus-royalties-deal-indicates-bright-future-for-orameds-oral-insulin/)\n\n  * [ December 22, 2015 ](https://oramed.com/2015/12/22/)\n\n\n\n[In the News](https://oramed.com/category/in-the-news/)\n\n[ ](https://oramed.com/seeking-alpha-50-million-plus-royalties-deal-indicates-bright-future-for-orameds-oral-insulin/)\n\n##### [CEO Nadav Kidron on the TD Ameritrade Network](https://oramed.com/ceo-nadav-kidron-on-the-td-ameritrade-network/)\n\n  * [ April 7, 2021 ](https://oramed.com/2021/04/07/)\n\n\n\n[In the News](https://oramed.com/category/in-the-news/)\n\n[ ](https://oramed.com/ceo-nadav-kidron-on-the-td-ameritrade-network/)\n\n  * [ +1-844-9-ORAMED ](tel:+18449ORAMED)\n  * office@oramed.com\n  * [ 1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036 USA ](https://www.google.com/maps?q=1185+Avenue+of+the+Americas,+3rd+Floor+-+New+York,+NY+10036+USA&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7-Y-MsdT3AhVHhf0HHVIhDzEQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw)\n\n\n\n[ Linkedin-in ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oramed-pharmaceuticals-inc./) [ Facebook-f ](https://www.facebook.com/oramed.pharmaceuticals) [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/OramedPharma) [ Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/c/OramedPharmaceuticals)\n\nCopyright © 2022 Oramed. | [Terms & Conditions](https://oramed.com/web-site-terms-and-conditions/) | [Privacy Statement](https://oramed.com/privacy-statement/) | [Cookie Policy](https://oramed.com/cookie-policy/)\n"
