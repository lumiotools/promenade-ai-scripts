(NASDAQ: CGON), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a potential backbone bladder-sparing therapeutic for patients with bladder cancer, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided business updates.\n\n“This quarter, we’ve continued to make significant advancements across our pipeline to bring forward a potential backbone bladder-sparing therapy for patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC),” said Arthur Kuan, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer at CG Oncology. “As we reported earlier this year at the AUA and ASCO annual meetings, cretostimogene has the ability to induce a sustained and durable complete response in bladder cancer patients with a strong safety and tolerability profile. We believe that cretostimogene’s unique product profile differentiates it from current and investigational NMIBC treatments, and we look forward to sharing updated results from our BOND-003 registrational study at SUO.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, were $540.7 million, compared with $552.9 million as of June 30, 2024. Based on current operating plans, the Company expects its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund operations through 2027.\n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses**: R&D expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $19.6 million compared with $11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses, including CMC costs, and an increase in compensation costs due to increased headcount.\n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses**: G&A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $8.7 million compared with $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in personnel-related expenses, including compensation costs from increased headcount, an increase in professional and consultant fees related to legal, accounting and consulting fees, and an increase in insurance and marketing-related costs.\n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $20.4 million, or ($0.30) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $17.5 million, or ($4.00) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec** Cretostimogene is an investigational, intravesically delivered oncolytic immunotherapy being evaluated in BOND-003, a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) who are unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy.

(NASDAQ: CGON), a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a potential backbone bladder-sparing therapeutic for patients with bladder cancer, today announced the publication in _Nature Medicine_ of Phase 1b investigator-sponsored study results evaluating intravesical cretostimogene grenadenorepvec in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab, in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The publication is now [available online](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=RpbqPIwEtOX8NggeT3h-v7yeeNZt8mlG1c-nStti9QWLqoPgc6G7gHHDbuint42R0RdvTvN2nP7zZnKX6KYN3vUmQ5BWCWBndBpyg55Ef68808y-iTKBstZsR-QmGqA1) and will be in a future print edition of _Nature Medicine_. The results were also presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 2024 by Dr. Roger Li, M.D., urologic oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\nThis is the second publication in _Nature Medicine_ evaluating the safety and efficacy of cretostimogene grenadenorepvec this year. In June 2024, _Nature Medicine_ published the [final results from CORE-001, a phase 2 study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2_CJkBHdWyW1qMRzMD1cxngfSqWmMkWpR_VM9RhG8mFlVJmQzJLK7wIc-U4sW75Ai-GMHB0xfIJqpB9FlFwqSKVk2YvCH9FT6LGm1mTKmh1gA24SQVOVMJ9C0vIKGQK8Rla26HChlWfp_UclIdelKKfjKbDpynL5CJGWN2dCxY4JUCBqzK0dqXqoT3166A1vnfvlanKxrA1c_uGIaJHOJpae-URoz6nHigVnOgeGb7Qdp7VDOzuG_-_v4wv-KtJO) of cretostimogene grenadenorepvec in combination with another checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab, in high-risk Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).\n\n“The recent _Nature Medicine_ publications underscore cretostimogene’s compelling safety profile and provide preliminary evidence supporting the potential use as a combination therapy for patients with different types of bladder cancer,” said Vijay Kasturi, MD, Chief Medical Officer, CG Oncology. “Cretostimogene’s dual mechanism of action positions it to potentially work well as either a monotherapy or in combination because it selectively replicates and destroys cancer cells while simultaneously amplifying the immune response against bladder tumors. Cretostimogene targets bladder cancer cells, without harming normal cells in the bladder. We are encouraged by cretostimogene’s strong body of clinical evidence to date, and we look forward to sharing topline results from our BOND-003 registrational study in High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer later this year.”\n\n**About the Phase 1b Study** The Phase 1b study examined the safety and efficacy of combining cretostimogene grenadenorepvec with nivolumab in patients with MIBC who were ineligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. Of the 21 patients enrolled and treated, there were no dose-limiting toxicity and no grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). Early indications of efficacy for the combination treatment include a pathologic complete response rate of 42.1%, which is significantly higher than what has been reported in the literature with nivolumab monotherapy, and 1-year recurrence free survival of 70.4%. Together, these results highlight the potential of cretostimogene grenadenorepvec in a combination for cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC.\n\nIn December 2023, the Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for cretostimogene in the same patient population supported by data from the Phase 3 BOND-003 trial. Data to-date shows a 75.2% complete response rate at any time with durable responses sustained over 12 months. Topline data from BOND-003 is expected by the end of 2024.\n\n**About Cretostimogene Grenadenorepvec** Cretostimogene is an investigational, intravesically delivered oncolytic immunotherapy being evaluated in BOND-003, a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with high-risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) who are unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy. Cretostimogene is also being evaluated in a Phase 3 monotherapy clinical trial (PIVOT-006) in patients with intermediate-risk NMIBC. In addition, cretostimogene is being evaluated in an investigator-sponsored clinical trial in combination with nivolumab for the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer.\n\nCretostimogene is an investigational, intravesically delivered oncolytic immunotherapy candidate, and its safety and efficacy have not been established by the FDA or any other health authority.\n\n**About CG Oncology** CG Oncology is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a potential backbone bladder-sparing therapeutic for patients afflicted with bladder cancer.
