(NASDAQ and TASE: ZOOZ), the leading provider of Flywheel-based power boosting and\npower management solutions enabling ultra-fast multi ports EV charging, today announced financial results for the six months ended June 30,\n2024 and provided a corporate update.\n“ZOOZ continues to penetrate as a prime solution for power boosting and management of multi-port ultra-fast EV charging where grid power is\ninsufficient”, said Avi Cohen, Executive Chairman and Interim CEO.\nMr. Cohen continued, “our ZOOZTER™-100 is now installed at major Charge Point Operators (CPOs) in Europe and Israel, enabling a\nsubstantial increase in the number of cars charged daily, reducing charging times, and significantly boosting the total power sold by CPOs. In\nparallel we continue to invest in improving our operational efficiency targeting a reduced cost platform and full manufacturing outsourcing.”\nOperational Highlights for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024\n● Successful completion of business combination\nOn July 30, 2023, ZOOZ and its wholly-owned subsidiary entered into a Business Combination Agreement and related agreements with Keyarch\nAcquisition Corporation and the other parties thereto (the “Business Combination Agreement” and the “Business Combination”, respectively).\nThe Business Combination and other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, as amended, closed on April 4, 2024.\nFollowing this completion, ZOOZ began trading on NASDAQ.\n● Enhancing Sales and Marketing efforts\nZOOZ strategically focuses on enhancing its sales and marketing efforts and has recruited a dedicated sales team tailored to key geographic\nmarkets. This initiative aims to drive growth by targeting scalable customers needing to increase the number of EVs charged per day where grid\npower is insufficient. As a result, ZOOZ strengthens its market presence and its engagement with high-potential regions and customer bases.\n● Enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness\nFollowing the successful market introduction and performance of the ZOOZTER™-100, ZOOZ started implementing a new version of\nthe product during the six months ended June 30, 2024. This new version employes the same technology as the current product but focuses on\nreducing production costs, including the bill of materials, assembly and integration time. The new version represents a strategic transition from\nproduct market fit to mass production, positioning the company for enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n● Collaboration with Dor-Alon and Afcon Electric Transportation\nIn May and June 2024, ZOOZ successfully deployed two of its Flywheel-based power boosting and management solution, delivering a significant\nupgrade to two ‘‘ON’ charging sites without requiring a grid upgrade. These sites are located at Dor-Alon stations on Route 6, the Cross-Israel\nHighway, one of the busiest transportation corridors in Israel. The ‘ON’ charging network is a strategic collaboration between Dor-Alon, a leading\ngas-station network operator, and Afcon Electric Transportation, a prominent CPO in Israel. The installation of the ZOOZ solution has\nsignificantly improved the number of EV charged in this station daily. These two systems were not yet recognized as revenues in the six months\nended June 30, 2024.\n● First Entry into the UK market\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, ZOOZ achieved a key milestone by entering the UK market through a collaboration with Osprey\nCharging, one of the top three CPOs in the UK with over 150 high-powered charging hubs across the UK. ZOOZ successfully installed its\nZOOZTER™-100 system at an Osprey-owned site, facilitating an upgrade to ultra-fast charging capabilities. Additionally, this site serves as a\ndemonstration platform for showcasing ZOOZ’s technology to potential customers and partners across the UK. This system has not been yet\nrecognized as revenues.\n● Memorandum of understanding with Arko Corp.\nIn June 2024, Arko Corp., together with ZOOZ, decided to terminate the joint pilot of ZOOZ’s solution at the Arko site and as a result terminated\nthe memorandum of understanding with ZOOZ in accordance with its terms.\nFinancial Highlights for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024\nCash: As of June 30, 2024, ZOOZ had approximately $11,228 thousand in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposit, compared with\napproximately $6,672 thousand as of December 31, 2023. Since ZOOZ has just started commercial sales of its products and considering ZOOZ’s\nexpected cash usage, early this year ZOOZ has initiated certain measures designed to reduce its operation cost, such as adjustments in its\nworkforce where it deemed appropriate and has continued its sales and marketing efforts. In addition, ZOOZ expects that it will need to obtain\nadditional funding in 2025 in connection with its continuing operations.\nRevenue: ZOOZ reported approximately $543 thousand in revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The revenue reported reflects sale of\nZOOZTER™-100 systems.\nCost of revenues: Cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were approximately $751 thousand.\nResearch and Development Expenses, Net: Research and development expenses, net for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were\napproximately $2,429 thousand, compared with approximately $2,652 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nSales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were approximately $830 thousand,\ncompared with approximately $1,331 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2024, were approximately\n$1,792 thousand, compared with approximately $1,528 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nNet loss: Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was approximately $5,237 thousand, or $0.59 per basic and diluted share, compared\nwith a net loss of approximately $5,402 thousand, or $0.91 per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nFull financial tables are included below.\nAbout ZOOZ Power\nZOOZ is the leading provider of Flywheel-based power boosting and power management solutions enabling widespread deployment of ultra-fast\nmulti ports charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EV), while overcoming existing grid limitations.\nZOOZ pioneers its unique Flywheel-based power boosting technology, enabling efficient utilization and power management of a power-limited\ngrid at an EV charging site.

The merger was\nnot within the scope of ASC 805 (“Business Combinations”) because Keyarch did not meet the definition of a business in accordance\nwith ASC 805. The merger was accounted for as a recapitalization; as such, any difference between the fair value of ZOOZ ordinary\nshares issued and the fair value of Keyarch’s identifiable net assets should be recorded as additional paid-in capital.\nAt the Closing Date and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, and in accordance with\nthe Cayman Act, Keyarch and Merger Sub consummated the Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub was merged with and into Keyarch,\nwith Keyarch being the surviving Company, following which the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub ceased and Keyarch\ncontinued as the surviving Company Pursuant to the Closing Date , Keyarch became a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.\nOn February 9, 2024, Keyarch and the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (hereinafter - “subscription\nagreements”). Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, the PIPE Investors agreed to subscribe for and purchase, an aggregate of\n1,300,000 Keyarch Class A ordinary shares for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $13,000,000.\nOn March 21, 2024, the extraordinary general meeting of the Company’s shareholders approved a reverse share split of the Company’s\nordinary Shares, effective as of March 25, 2024, at a conversion ratio of 11.43720665.\nThe Company accounted for the Reverse Stock Splits on a retroactive basis pursuant to ASC 260. As a result, all common stock,\nwarrants, and options outstanding and exercisable for common stock, exercise prices and loss per share amounts have been adjusted, on a\nretroactive basis, for all periods presented in these financial statements and the applicable disclosures, to reflect such Reverse Stock Split.\nOn April 4, 2024, ZOOZ issued promissory notes in favor of Keyarch and EarlyBirdCapital (hereinafter EBC underwriters in Keyarch’s\ninitial public offering), for the principal amount of $2,030,000 and $840,000 respectively. The Notes mature on April 4, 2026 and accrues\ninterest at an annual rate of 8%, which interest increases to 15% if the Note is not paid when due. In addition, ZOOZ is required to make\nmandatory cash prepayments on the Note from time to time in amounts equal to 25% of the gross proceeds less sales commissions\nreceived by ZOOZ from equity or equity-linked financings.\nFurther, at any time, EBC may elect to have any amount of outstanding principal and/or accrued interest of the EBC Note by the transfer\nof Sponsor Earnout Shares then remaining in the Escrow Account (as defined below) to EBC, with the price per Sponsor Earnout Share\nfor purposes of determining the amount of the obligations satisfied under the EBC Note for such prepayment being equal to ninety\npercent (90%) of the volume weighted average price of an ordinary share of ZOOZ on the principal U.S. securities exchange on which\nZOOZ’s ordinary shares then trade for the five trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the Sponsor’s and\nZOOZ’s receipt of the applicable prepayment notice from EBC .\n8\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Sponsor Earnout Shares were deposited in an escrow account (the “Escrow Account”) at the Closing pursuant to an escrow\nagreement, dated April 4, 2024 (the “Escrow Agreement”), which Escrow Agreement governs the release of such Sponsor Earnout\nShares in accordance with the Sponsor Letter Agreement, Sponsor Note and EBC Note.\nThe Company’s shareholders are entitled to additional contingent consideration of up to 4 million ordinary shares upon the Company’s\nachievement of the applicable earnout milestones (hereinafter - “the Earnout Rights”), During five years commencing at the end of the\nfull fiscal quarter following the Closing date. In the event the volume-weighted average price of ZOOZ ordinary shares (“VWAP”)\nexceeds $12, for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period during such period, then 1 million\nEarnout Shares will be issuable (constituting 25% of the Earnout Shares). In addition, in the event the VWAP exceeds $16 for the Trading\nPeriod, then 1,400,000 Earnout Shares are issuable (constituting 35% of the Earnout Shares), and additionally, in the event VWAP\nexceeds $23 for the Trading Period, then 1,600,000 Earnout Shares are issuable (constituting 40% of the Earnout Shares) as set forth in\nthe Business Combination Agreement, in the form of non-tradable, non-assignable rights, that were issued by the Company pro rata to the\nPre-Closing Company Shareholders on April 4, 2024. The earnout are indexed to the Company’s own stock and, accordingly, the earnout\nis now classified within equity.\nIn connection to the Closing date of the Business Combination, the Company’s ordinary shares and public warrants began trading on the\nNasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbols “ZOOZ” and “ZOOZW”, respectively, on April 5, 2024, and became a dual Company.\nFollowing the Issuance of Earnout rights in April 2024, the Company’s options and warrants conversion ratio has been adjusted, so each\noption or warrant will be exercisable to 1.18961 common shares.\nAs part of the transaction Keyarch’s warrants at an amount of 6,022,050 with a total fair value of $0.3 million were converted to the\nCompany’s warrants and were recorded in the consolidated financial statements, measured in accordance with the fair market value, as\ndetermined in accordance with the closing market price at the closing date. Changes in fair value are recognized through finance income\nor expense in the statement of operations. For more information see Note 7.\nThe net proceeds received by the Company as part of the Merger Agreement Closing and the PIPE Financing totaled to $10.875 million;\nissuance costs of $ 148 thousand were recorded as a reduction to Shareholders’ Equity.\nCurrent impact of Swords of Iron War\nOn October 7, 2023, following a surprise attack by the terrorist organization, Hamas, from the Gaza Strip, the Israeli government\ndeclared the “Swords of Iron” War. Following the attack from the Gaza Strip, an attack was also launched towards northern Israel by the\nterrorist organization, Hezbollah, from Lebanon and tensions in other sectors increased. As of the date of approval of the financial\nstatements, the security situation in both the southern sector and the northern sector remained tense, and the uncertainty regarding the\nreturn to normalcy remains.\nThe Company’s factory is located in the city of Lod. The Company’s facilities were not damaged during the war. In accordance with the\nguidelines of the National Emergency Authority, there is no denial of access or any restriction in the activity of the Company’s facilities.\nAs of the date of approval of the financial statements, the Company operates normally. As of the date of publication of the financial\nstatements, there is no material impact on the Company’s supply chain. However, if the security situation continues for an extended\nperiod of time, the Company’s production capacity and even marketing and advertising activities outside of Israel may be affected. At\nthis stage, the Company cannot reasonably assess the consequences of the continuation of the Swords of Iron War on the level of its\nactivity and the results of this activity. These consequences depend, among other things, on the duration and scope of the war, on its\neconomic effects on the entire economy in Israel and on the ability to raise capital from foreign and local investors and the industry in\nwhich the Company operates.\n9\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe Company continues regularly to monitor the development of events and considers the implications for its business activity and the\nmeasures it will take accordingly.\nLiquidity\nThe Company has net losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 in the amounts of $5,237 thousand $5,402\nthousands and negative cash flows from operating activities in the amounts of $6,040 thousand and $5,808 thousand, respectively.\nThe Company has historically financed its operations over the years by raising funds from investors. On April 4, 2024, the Company\nfinalized a merger deal with a SPAC. As part of the merger 10.875 million USD, was invested in the company. Since the Company has\njust started commercial sales of its products and considering the Company’s expected cash usage, the Company’s cash balance as of June\n30, 2024, and as of the date of approval of the financial statements is not sufficient to continue the Company’s operations for at least 12\nmonths from the date of approval of the financial statements. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue the Company’s operations, including research and development and sales and marketing, the Company is looking to\nsecure financing from various sources, including additional investment funding. There is no assurance that the Company will be\nsuccessful in obtaining the level of financing necessary to finance its operation.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. ZOOZ’s management believes that the estimates,\njudgments, and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments\nand assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates, and such differences may have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. As applicable to these financial\nstatements, the most significant estimates relate to inventory net realizable value and share-based compensation.\nBasis of presentation of financial statements\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) for interim financial reporting.\nCertain prior-period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been\ncondensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the information contained herein reflects all\nadjustments necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and shareholders’ equity. All such\nadjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.\n10\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 shown in these financial statements are not necessary indicative of the\nresults to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024. The unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThere have been no material changes in our significant accounting policies as described in our financial statements for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe carrying value of cash, other current assets and accounts payables, other payables and accrued expenses (included in the condensed\nbalance sheets) approximates their fair value because of their generally short maturities. The promissory notes bear annual interest at\nrates close to the prevailing market rates.\nThe fair value of restricted bank deposits approximates the carrying value since they bear interest at rates close to the prevailing market\nrates.\nThe Company’s financial instruments which are considered as a Level 3 measurement are the warrants liability and the share-based\npayment liability. For more information see Note 7 and Note 8, respectively.\nConcentration of credit risks\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and restricted bank deposits.\nThe Company’s cash and restricted bank deposits are invested in banks domiciled in Israel. Accordingly, management believes that these\nrestricted bank deposits have minimal credit risk.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements:\nAccounting Pronouncements effective in future periods\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The ASU improves the transparency\nof income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation\nand (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of\nincome tax disclosures. The ASU is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The Company\nis evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this Update should be\napplied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures. The ASU improves reportable segments disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about\nsignificant segment expenses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of this\nguidance on its Segment disclosure. A public entity should apply the amendments in this Update retrospectively to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements.\n11\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 3 - CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED BANK DEPOSITS:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits reported on the balance sheets that\nsum to the same total amount as shown in the statements of cash flows:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars\nin thousands\nCash and cash equivalents 7,721 6,672\nRestricted bank deposits 219 224\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted bank deposits shown in the\nstatement of cash flows 7,940 6,896\nNOTE 4 - INVENTORY:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars\nin thousands\nRaw materials 882 955\nWork in process 518 425\nFinished goods 1,070 1,468\n2,470 2,848\nThe Company recorded an inventory write-off of $185 thousands during the six months period ended June 30, 2024, which is presented\nwithin cost of revenue in the statement of operations. Inventory write-offs were recorded to reflect anticipated net realizable value on\ndisposition of existing inventory assets.\nNOTE 5 - OTHER PAYABLES AND ACCRUED EXPENSES:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars\nin thousands\nAccrued expenses 498 1,045\nGrants in advance 368 267\nOthers 46 75\n912 1,387\nNOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nThe total amount of grants received from, the BIRD Foundation and from NYPA during the period of six months ended June 30, 2024, is\n$278 thousand. An amount of $18 thousand and $70 thousands were deducted from research and development expenses for the periods\nended on June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. An amount of $180 thousand was deducted from Sales and Marketing expenses for the\nperiod ended on June 30, 2024 (the amount deducted was received during 2023 and was recorded as liability as of December 31, 2023).\nFollowing to the Company’s commitment to pay royalties to the IIA and to other governmental institutions, and the sales incurred during\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision of $59 thousand for royalties to the IIA and other governmental\ninstitutions. Total contingent obligation as of June 30, 2024 amounts to $2.3 million\n12\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 7 - WARRANTS LIABILTY:\nAs part of the transaction mentioned in note 1, Keyarch’s warrants were converted to the Company’s warrants and recorded in the\nconsolidated financial statements. The exercise price of the warrants is $11.5 and they will expire within five years following the Closing\nDate, July 2019. Since the warrants’ exercise price is denominated in a currency other than the Company’s functional currency, the\nwarrants are not considered indexed to the Company’s own stock and thus meet the definition of a financial liability. Accordingly, until\ntheir exercise, the warrants are measured at fair value each reporting period, and changes in their fair value are recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of operations as part of financial income, net.\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in\norder to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in\nwhich transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an\nongoing basis.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for\nsimilar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset\nor liability.\nThe table below sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the warrants liability classified as Level 1:\nJune 30,\n2024\nU.S. dollars\nin thousands\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 -\nInitial recognition 306\nChanges in fair value (125)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 181\n13\nNOTE 8 - SHARE BASED COMPENSATION:\nEquity classified awards.\nThe value of benefit is measured on the grant date by reference to the fair value of the granted equity instruments, as described above.\nThe fair value is calculated using the Black and Scholes formula, with the following assumptions:\nJune 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nDividend yield 0% 0%\nExpected volatility* 55%-89% 74%-76%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.3%-5.8% 3.3%-3.9%\nExpected term (years) 2-7 years 4-7 years\nExercise price (USD) 3.32-15.45 3.32-11.78\n* Volatility is based on the historical fluctuation in share prices of peer companies over similar periods to the expected life of the\noption until exercise date.\nThe following is summary information of equity classified options in 2023:\nSix months ended\nJune 30, 2024\nWeighted average\nWeighted average remaining Aggregate\nexercise price contractual life Intrinsic\nNumber USD years Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023 428,457 7.55 8.9 -\nForfeited (64,672) 10.5 6.9 -\nReclassification of liability classified\nshare-based compensation awards to equity 401,794 9.32 5.7 -\nOutstanding as of June 30, 2024 765,579 8.31 7.1 -\nExercisable as of June 30, 2024 528,031 8.80 6.5 -\n14\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following is information regarding exercise prices and remaining contractual lives of outstanding options as of June 30, 2024:\nJune 30, 2024\noutstanding Exercisable\nWeighted Weighted\nNumber of average Number of average\noptions Exercise price remaining options Exercise price remaining\noutstanding range (USD) contractual life Exercisable range (USD) contractual life\n40,654 3.22 9.1 - - -\n37594 4.23 8.7 11,751 4.23 8.7\n9,617 4.63 8.5 3,525 4.63 8.5\n13,115 4.71 8.6 4,099 4.71 8.6\n48,222 5.74 8.0 24,863 5.74 8.0\n85,247 7.12 8.2 39,346 7.12 8.2\n75,309 7.57 3.5 75,309 7.57 3.5\n46,048 7.61 8.8 46,048 7.61 8.8\n238,340 7.82 6.3 238,340 7.82 6.3\n36,931 8.73 8.8 - - -\n36,931 11.35 8.8 - - -\n78,336 15.63 6.3 68,793 15.63 6.3\n19,235 17.47 7.3 15,957 17.47 7.3\n765,579 8.14 7.8 528,031 8.25 9.37\nAs of June 30, 2024, there is an unrecognized share-based compensation expense of $223 thousand to be recognized over the\naverage remaining vesting period of 2.26 years.\nLiability classified awards\nThe options were classified as liabilities in accordance with ASC 718, as the exercise price is denominated in USD, that is not the\nCompany’s functional currency and not the employees’ salary currency or the currency in which the employees are paid.\nAccordingly, the options were measured at fair value each reporting period, and changes in their fair value were recognized in the\nstatements of operations. The fair value of the options as of the closing date, April 4, 2024, was evaluated using the Black-Scholes\nOption Pricing Model. Following the merger in April 2024, as detailed in note 1, given that the currency of the market in which the\nCompany’s equity securities are traded, these awards were reclassified to equity. For the various scenarios modeled, volatility is\nbased on companies in the industry by statistical analysis of a daily share pricing model. The risk-free interest rate assumption is\nbased on observed interest rates appropriate for the period until the options expiration date.\nThe table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the options:\nNumber of options Fair value (U.S.\nmeasured at fair Dollars in\nvalue thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 405,714 232\nEffect of change in exchange rate - (4)\nChanges in fair value - 74\nReclassification of liability classified share-based compensation awards to\nequity (401,794) (302)\nBalance as of June 30, 2024 - -\n15\nZOOZ POWER LTD\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes assumptions used as of December 31, 2023:\nDecember 31,\n2023\nExpected dividend 0%\nExpected volatility 79.6%-95.7%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.68%-5.27%\nExpected life 1.5-5\nExercise price (USD) 0.40-1.37\nThe table below presents the expense (income) recognized in the financial statements of the Company in respect to share-based payment:\nSix months ended June 30\n2024 2023\nEquity classified Liability Equity classified Liability Total\nawards classified awards Total expense awards classified awards expense\nCost of\nrevenue - - - (19) (5) (24)\nResearch and\ndevelopment\nexpenses\n(income) 67 41 108 103 (116) (13)\nSales and\nmarketing\nexpenses\n(income) 51 20 71 46 (21) 25\nGeneral and\nAdministrative\nexpenses 72 13 85 150 3 153\n190 74 264 280 (139) 141\nNOTE 9 - RELATED PARTIES TRANSACTIONS:\nSix months ended June 30\n2024 2023\nU.S. dollars\nin thousands\nBalances With Related Parties:\nPromissory note 2,069 -\nTransactions with Related Parties:\nFinance expenses:\nInterest expense related to Promissory note 39 -\nShare based compensation:\nResearch and development income, net 20 (22)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 81 95\nOn June 1, 2024, the CEO ceased his service.

This discussion should\nbe read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the notes thereto which are included in this Report of\nForeign Private Issuer on Form 6-K. In addition, this information should also be read in conjunction with the information contained in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form-20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on April 30, 2024, or the 2023 Annual Report,\nincluding the audited consolidated annual financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes\nincluded therein.\nAs a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements,” ZOOZ’s actual results\ncould differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and\nanalysis. Throughout this section, unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, “we,” “us,” “our,” “ZOOZ” and the “Company”\nrefer to ZOOZ Power Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiary, and in references to monetary amounts, “dollars” and “$” refer to U.S. Dollars, and\n“NIS” refers to New Israeli Shekels.\nCertain figures, including interest rates and other percentages included in this section, have been rounded for ease of presentation.\nPercentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such\namounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same\ncalculations using the figures in ZOOZ’s condensed consolidated interim financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that\nappear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nOverview\nZOOZ develops, produces, markets and sells Flywheel-based power boosting and power management solutions for ultra-fast multi-ports\nEV (Electrical Vehicles) charging. The system is based on kinetic storage using flywheels. ZOOZ has developed proprietary flywheel technology\nfor storing kinetic energy and as of the date of this Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K, has introduced two generations of Kinetic\nStorage Systems – the KPB50, which was ZOOZ’s first-generation product and was introduced in 2018 as proof-of-concept and for market\nintroduction, and the ZOOZTER™-100, ZOOZ’s second-generation product, which was introduced in 2022.\nAs of the date of this Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K, ZOOZ operates in the market of charging infrastructure for EVs and\nprimarily in the field of ultra-fast charging for EVs. Based on its technology, ZOOZ develops systems comprised of an array of flywheels and\nsupporting sub-systems, which get charged from the electricity grid. This energy, when discharged, is added to the power from the grid, which\ntogether constitute power levels that are twice to three times the power that is supplied from the grid, thus enabling high-power charging of the EV\neven in areas where the electricity grid has limited power. ZOOZ refers to these systems as power boosters.\nRecent Developments\n● Successful completion of business combination\nOn July 30, 2023, ZOOZ and its wholly owned subsidiary entered into a Business Combination Agreement and related agreements with Keyarch\nAcquisition Corporation and the other parties thereto (the “Business Combination Agreement” and the “Business Combination”, respectively).\nThe Business Combination and other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, as amended, closed on April 4, 2024,\nfollowing this, ZOOZ began trading on NASDAQ.\n● Collaboration with Dor-Alon and Afcon Electric Transportation\nIn May and June 2024, ZOOZ successfully deployed its Flywheel-based power boosting and management solution, delivering a significant\nupgrade to two ‘ON’ charging sites without requiring a grid upgrade. These sites are located at Dor-Alon stations on Route 6, the Cross-Israel\nHighway, one of the busiest transportation corridors in Israel. The ‘ON’ charging network is a strategic collaboration between Dor-Alon, a leading\ngas-station network operator, and Afcon Electric Transportation, a prominent Charge Point Operator (CPO) in Israel. Although these two systems\nwere not yet recognized as revenues in H2, their installation has significantly improved business results.\n● First Entry into the UK market\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, ZOOZ achieved a key milestone by entering the UK market through Osprey Charging, one of the top\nthree Charge Point Operators (CPOs) in the UK with over 150 high-powered charging hubs across the UK. ZOOZ successfully installed its\nZOOZTER™-100 system at an Osprey-owned site, facilitating an upgrade to ultra-fast charging capabilities. Additionally, this site serves as a\ndemonstration platform for showcasing ZOOZ’s technology to potential customers and partners across the UK. This system has not been yet\nrecognized as revenues.\n● Memorandum of understanding with Arko Corp.\nIn June 2024, Arko Corp. together with ZOOZ decided to terminate the trial of the ZOOZ solution at the Arko site and as a result terminated the\nmemorandum of understanding with ZOOZ in accordance with its terms.\n● Enhancing Sales and Marketing efforts\nThe company strategically focuses on enhancing its sales and marketing efforts and has recruited a dedicated sales team tailored to key geographic\nmarkets. This initiative aims to drive growth by targeting scalable customers needing to increase the number of cars charged per day where grid\npower is insufficient. As a result, ZOOZ strengthens its market presence and optimizes engagement with high-potential regions and customer\nbases.\n● Enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness\nFollowing the successful market introduction and performance of the ZOOZTER™-100, ZOOZ started implementing a new design\nduring the six months ended June 30, 2024. This redesign employes the same technology as the current design but focuses on reducing production\ncosts, including the bill of materials, assembly and integration time. The updated version represents a strategic transition from product market fit\nto mass production, positioning the company for enhanced operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\nComparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2023\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations data for the periods presented:\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nUS dollars in thousands (unaudited)\nRevenues 543 784\nCost of revenue 751 981\nGross loss (208) (197)\nResearch and development, net 2,429 2,652\nSales and marketing 830 1,331\nGeneral and administrative 1,792 1,528\nOperating loss (5,259) (5,708)\nFinance income, net 22 306\nNet loss (5,237) (5,402)\nNet loss per ordinary share attributable to shareholders - basic and diluted* (0.59) (0.91)\nWeighted average ordinary shares outstanding – basic and diluted* 8,854 5,912\n* All share and per share information retroactively reflects reverse stock split.\nCost of Sale\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nUS dollars in thousands (unaudited)\nCost of Sales 751 981\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, cost of revenue primarily consisted of: cost of goods\nsold and inventory fair value adjustment.\nOperating Expenses\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nUS dollars in thousands (unaudited)\nResearch and development, net 2,429 2,652\nSales and marketing, net 830 1,331\nGeneral and administrative 1,792 1,528\nTotal operating expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses, Net\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, research and development expenses, net, decreased by $223 thousands, from $2,652 thousands\nfor the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $2,429 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, grants from government and others, in the amounts of $18 thousand and $70\nthousand, respectively, were deducted from research and development expenses.\nThe research and development activities during the six months ended June 30,2024, is primarily related to new design of\nZOOZTER™-100 supporting production cost reduction (Bill of material, assembly & integration time). The design reflects the transition from\nproduct market fit units to mass production design. The design is based on current flywheel technology but includes flywheel assembly process\nimprovement, enhanced drivers and inverters.\nThe decrease in research and development expenses, net for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was mainly due to the completion of\nnew motor development and adjustments in headcount aligned with the company’s focus on cost reduction and reliability enhancement. The\ncompany anticipates an increase in research and development activities in the second half of 2024.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $501 thousands, from $1,331 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $830\nthousands for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended June\n30, 2023 is primarily due to a reduction in headcount and the termination of certain service providers as part of cost-saving measures. The strategy\nalso involves reallocating resources to establish a focused sales team for key geographic markets, set to commence in the second half of 2024.\nZOOZ anticipates an increase in sales and marketing expenses in the second half of 2024 due to such reallocation of resources.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, grants from NYPA in the amounts of $180 thousand, were deducted from Sales and Marketing\nExpenses. No grants were deducted from Sale and Marketing expenses in the six months ended in June 30,2023.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $264 thousands, from $1,528 thousands on for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to\n$1,792 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the six months ended\nJune 30, 2023, is mainly attributed to the higher premium of the D&O insurance that we, as a company listed for trading on the NASDAQ are\nrequired to maintain following the closing of the Business combination.\nFinancial Income (expenses), Net\nFinancial income, net, decreased by $284 thousands from $306 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to $22 thousands for\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in financial income, net, in the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the six months\nended June 30, 2023, is primarily attributed to foreign exchange rate and interest on bank deposits. This decrease is primarily due to fluctuations in\nforeign exchange rates and a reduction in income from interest on bank deposits, resulting from shorter deposit durations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nZOOZ has historically funded its operations primarily from private placements of its equity securities and public offerings of its securities\nfollowing its initial public offering on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange, as well as the Business Combination and Merger between ZOOZ, Keyarch\nAcquisition Corporation and the other parties thereto, which consummated on April 4, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, ZOOZ had $7,721 thousand in\ncash and cash equivalents and $3,507 thousand in short term deposits.\nThe table below presents our cash flows for the periods indicated.\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nUS dollars in thousands (unaudited)\nNet cash used in operating activities (6,040) (5,808)\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,538) (583)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 10,727 -\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows used in operating activities increased by $232 thousands from $5,808 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to\n$6,040 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributed to D&O insurance premium paid following the\nmerger.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities increased by $2,955 thousands, from $583 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2023, to\n$3,538 thousands for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributed to investment in short term deposit.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities increased by $10,727 thousands. The cash flow from financing activity is attributed to the\nproceeds received by the Company as part of the merger agreement closing.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nobligations, income and expenses during the reporting periods. A comprehensive discussion of our critical accounting estimates is included under\nNote 2 to the financial statements included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Israeli Securities Law,\n1968 and the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, with respect to the business, financial condition and\nresults of operations of the Company. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions. Forward-\nlooking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “will,” “may,” “assume,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “could,” “project,”\n“estimate,” “possible,” “potential,” “believe,” “suggest,” and “intend,” and similar expressions that are intended to identify forward-looking\nstatements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements involve known and\nunknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,\nperformance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements represent our views only\nas of the date hereof and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. We do not assume any obligation to update\nany forward-looking statements unless required by law.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results, developments, and business decisions to differ materially from those anticipated in these\nforward-looking statements include, among other things:\n● Our limited operating history and evolving business model may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business and future\nprospects.\n● We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and if we are unable to remediate these\nmaterial weaknesses or identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of\ninternal control over financial reporting, this may impair our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations.\n● Our management has determined that substantial doubt exists about the continued existence of ZOOZ as a “going concern”. The\nreport of ZOOZ’s independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2023, includes a going concern\nqualification.\n● Changes to fuel economy standards or changes to governments’ regulations and policies in relation to environment or the success of\nalternative fuels may negatively impact the electric cars (“EVs” or “electric vehicles”) market and thus the demand for our products.\n● Delays in deployment of public ultra-fast charging infrastructure may limit the need and urgency for our products.\n● Market education regarding the concept and value of power boosters is still in process and may not materialize as anticipated by us,\nor at all.\n● Our market penetration is partially related to government and other public incentive plans supporting charging infrastructure,\nchanges or reductions on those, which are in turn subject to political, economic, and environmental factors which are beyond our\ncontrol.\n● We have gained limited experience in a small number of territories, which include Israel, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. If we fail\nto expand our geographic footprint and to build scalable and robust processes, our prospects for growth and profitability could be\nharmed, and we may never successfully do so or achieve or sustain profitability.\n● We face risks related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business, including worldwide or regional economic\nconditions, exchange rate fluctuations, adverse changes in EV and/or power booster market conditions and the competitiveness of the\nmarket.\n● We may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations, as we need to continue to improve our\noperational, financial and management controls, compliance programs and reporting systems, including our compliance programs,\nprivacy, cybersecurity and anti-corruption and financial controls, and we may not be successful in doing so.\n● We currently face competition from a number of companies, mainly specialized platform providers for residential or commercial and\nindustrial applications and expect to face significant competition in the future as the market for the EV high power charging\ninfrastructure further develops.\n● We rely on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for our products, some of which provide us with custom-designed\ncomponents and sub-systems. A loss of any of these key suppliers and manufacturers could negatively affect our business.\n● Increases in costs, disruption of supply, or shortage of materials, have harmed and could harm our business again in the future.\n● Our business is subject to risks associated with permitting, construction, cost overruns and delays, and other contingencies that may\narise in the course of completing installations, and such risks may increase in the future.\n● Expanding our operations internationally is likely to expose us to additional tax, compliance, market and other risks.\n● The EV and energy storage market currently benefits from the availability of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives from\ngovernments, utilities and others to offset the purchase or operating cost of EVs, EV charging stations and flywheel-based storage\nsystems. The reduction, modification, or elimination of such benefits, or any delay in payment could cause reduced demand for our\nproducts or delay their purchase or production, which would adversely affect our financial results.\n● We are dependent on several key employees; the loss of their services and our failure to hire additional qualified key personnel could\nharm our business.\n● Failures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of\njurisdictions in which we operate may adversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain and may\nrequire improvements in, or changes to, our policies and operations.\n● We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or\nreverse engineering our technology or products. Our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and prevent third\nparties from violating our rights may be costly.\n● In addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how, which\nwe may not be able to protect.\n● Technology failures or cyberattacks on our technology systems or our ineffective response to technology failures or cyberattacks\ncould disrupt our operations and negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n● Interruption, interference with or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to\neffectively offer our products, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\n● We may be exposed to liability if we fail to comply with the provisions of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and\nforeign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, privacy, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations.\n● Geo-political conditions in the Middle East and in Israel, including the current conflicts in Gaza and in the Northern part of Israel\nthat started in the fourth quarter of 2023, may adversely affect our operations.\n● If U.S. securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about ZOOZ, its business, or its market,\nor if they change their recommendations regarding the ZOOZ ordinary shares adversely, then the price and trading volume of the\nZOOZ ordinary shares on the Nasdaq could decline.\n● The U.S. market price for the ZOOZ ordinary shares may be depressed by the terms of any financing which is likely to result in\nsignificant dilution or by our failure to obtain necessary financing.\n● The future exercise of registration rights and sale by our shareholders of their ZOOZ ordinary shares, including shares by\nshareholders subject to lock-ups upon expiration of their lock-ups, may adversely affect the market price of ZOOZ ordinary shares\non the Nasdaq.\n● In case ZOOZ will not be successful to reach its cost reduction targets during the next couple of years, this may prejudice ZOOZ’s\nprofitability and market penetration."

          "content": "CODE OF ETHICS\nFOR SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS\nEffective as of April 4, 2024\nThis Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers (the “Code of Ethics”) applies to the\nChief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Director of Finance, Controller, Assistant\nController and persons performing similar functions (collectively, the “Senior Financial Officers”)\nof ZOOZ Power Ltd. or its subsidiary (together, “ZOOZ Power” or the “Company”). Its purpose is\nto promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with the law, particularly as related to the\nmaintenance of the Company’s financial records and the preparation of financial statements filed\nwith or submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The obligations\nof this Code supplement, but do not replace, the Code of Business Conduct applicable to all ZOOZ\nPower employees.\n1. Senior Financial Officers are expected to carry out their responsibilities honestly and with\nintegrity, exercising at all times their best independent judgment.\n2. Senior Financial Officers should avoid, to the extent possible, situations in which their own\ninterests, conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the interest of the Company. Conflicts of interest\nare sometimes unavoidable, however.

Furthermore, the Company is committed to complying with the tracking and disclosure requirements\nwith regard to transfers of value to healthcare professionals under all U.S. or any foreign law or regulation,\nincluding the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, when applicable. Thus, all reportable payments and\ntransfers of value must be captured by Company Personnel and reported to the Company finance\ndepartment, including all compensation and honoraria payments, travel expenses, meal expenses, gifts, and\nother expenses and benefits received by the healthcare professional service provider, if applicable.\nAny concerns regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters should\nbe directed to the Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Audit\nCommittee”), on either an anonymous or non-anonymous basis by following the procedures set forth in\nParagraph 20 below.\n8. Avoid Conflicts of Interest.\nAll Company Personnel (including their family members) must avoid conflict of interest situations between\ntheir personal interests, direct or indirect, and the interests of the Company. While it is not possible to\ndescribe every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise, Company Personnel must never use or\nattempt to use their position with the Company to obtain improper personal benefits, directly or indirectly,\nfor themselves, family members or friends. The following situations are examples of a potential conflict of\ninterest:\n• provide services to or own more than 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital (or stock\noptions) in business entities which are competitors, partners, collaborators or suppliers of the\nCompany;\n• cause the Company to engage in business transactions with family members or friends;\n• use information of the Company, a collaborator, customer or supplier for your own personal\ngain, or the personal gain of family members or friends;\n• have a financial interest in the Company’s customers, suppliers or competitors which is not\nderived solely from holdings of up to 4.99% of the issued and outstanding share capital of such\nentity; or\n• compete with the Company while still engaged by the Company.\nAny Company Personnel who is involved in or is aware of a conflict of interest, or is concerned that a\nconflict of interest might reasonably develop, must notify his or her direct supervisor immediately or follow\nthe reporting procedures set forth in Paragraph 20 below. If such notification is to the direct supervisor, the\ndirect supervisor will advise the Head of HR, who in turn will consult with the CEO to provide a considered\nand confidential response.\n9. Corporate Opportunities.\nCompany Personnel owe a duty to advance the legitimate interests of the Company when opportunities\narise. Company Personnel may not take for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through\nthe use of corporate property, information or position. Participation in an investment or outside business\nopportunity that is directly related to the Company’s lines of business must be pre-approved by the CEO.\nPage 4 of 9\n10. Honest and Fair Dealing.\nCompany Personnel must endeavor to deal honestly, ethically and fairly with the Company’s partners,\nsuppliers, competitors and employees. No Company Personnel should take unfair advantage of anyone\nthrough manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts,\nor any other unfair dealing practice. Honest conduct is considered to be conduct that is free from fraud or\ndeception.

No Side Agreements.\nNo Company Personnel may enter into a side letter with a partner or a prospective partner regarding the\nsale or transfer of the Company’s products or into any similar arrangement, whether written or not, that\nresults in the actual terms of a sale or transfer being different from those included in the relevant license,\nmanufacture, or purchase agreement with a partner or purchase orders received from a partner. For\nexample, side agreements include not only separate hard copy letters or agreements but also may include\nverbal obligations or promises as well as obligations set out in email communication with third parties.\nCompany Personnel may not make any such side agreement obligations in email communications which\nmay bind the Company.\n13.

Computers and Emails.\nAll Company Personnel should read and be familiar with the Company’s IT Policy, available on\nSharepoint. Company Personnel are strictly prohibited from sending email or other communication of a\ndiscriminatory, harassing, inciting, intimidating, pornographic, sexually explicit or otherwise offensive\nnature. Company Personnel encountering or receiving such material, or other improper email or other\ncommunication, shall immediately report such email or other communication to either their direct\nsupervisor or the Chief Financial Officer.\n16. Social Media, Public Discussions and Political Activity.\nThe Company respects the right of Company Personnel to use websites, web logs, and other forms of social\nmedia as a medium for self-expression. However, whether or not Company Personnel chooses to identify\nhim/herself as such, he or she should write in the first person and make it clear that the views expressed\nare his or hers alone and in no event shall refer to the Company and any information related thereto. Each\nCompany Personnel assumes full responsibility and liability for his/her use of social media and should\nabide by all ZOOZ Power policies including the Company’s policies on insider trading, disclosure and\nconfidentiality.\nKeeping ZOOZ Power confidential information confidential is a keystone of our business. Many Company\nPersonnel know things about the Company which are not known to the public, and which if disclosed,\ncould affect ZOOZ Power’s business operations and financial condition. It is essential to safeguard ZOOZ\nPower information, especially on the internet. Any Company information that is confidential and\nproprietary and which has not been released to the public (whether of a financial, technical, legal, or\nbusiness nature) must not be disclosed on any social media forum. Moreover, since information published\non such social media forums is accessible by the general public, the Company expects no comments with\nrespect to the Company, its employees, customers, partners, affiliates and others (including competitors).\nWhile Company Personnel are free to associate with any political activity and to donate their money and\nfree time to such activity, they may not create the impression that they are speaking or acting for or on\nbehalf of the Company. It is clarified that the Company Personnel may not use the Company’s resources\n(e.g., money, Company’s facilities, supplies, letterhead, corporate names, logos or working time) to support\nany such political activity.\nPage 6 of 9\n17. Insider Trading Prohibited.\nNo Company Personnel is permitted to buy or sell shares or other securities of the Company or other\ncompanies, or give advice thereon, if he or she has access to any material, non-public information relating\nto the Company or such other company, including a collaboration partner, customer or supplier that has a\nbusiness relationship with the Company. Trading by Company Personnel of the Company’s securities,\nincluding the exercise of options and sale of the underlying shares, is permitted only in accordance with\nthe Company’s Insider Trading Policy, which is incorporated into the Internal Compliance Plan.\n18. Protection of Intellectual Property.\nIntellectual property rights and proprietary confidential information (collectively “IP”) are key components\nof the Company’s assets. Therefore, Company Personnel shall take appropriate action to preserve and\nenhance the Company’s IP and respect the IP rights of other persons and entities. The Company’s IP\nincludes, but is not limited to, its intellectual property rights in its scientific and technological know-how,\ninformation about ZOOZ Power’s business strategies and intentions, information about current and\npotential industry partnerships or licensing arrangements, information regarding plans for research or\nfuture research, internal databases, customer lists, confidential technical data, organizational charts,\nemployee directories and compensation information. Company Personnel are contractually bound to keep\nin confidence ZOOZ Power’s assets under the terms and conditions of ZOOZ Power’s Employee\nProprietary Information and Inventions Agreement.\nAccordingly, ZOOZ Power’s IP must be kept confidential and must not be disclosed, verbally, in writing,\nor electronically (e.g. via the internet) or in any other way, unless specifically and expressly authorized by\na manager responsible for the information being disclosed and, then, only subject to the provisions of a\nnon-disclosure agreement. When speaking with third parties, it is important to avoid unauthorized\ndisclosure of any of the Company’s IP. Company Personnel must also ensure that confidential discussions\nare not overheard by others or disclosed by careless transmission of information, for example by use of\nelectronic mail. Any documents containing proprietary information which are being disposed of, should be\nshredded. The Company stores a great deal of information on computer drivers and other storage devices.\nIf any such equipment (such as a computer, mobile phone, storage device or hard copy) is lost or stolen, it\nis imperative that employees report this loss immediately to their manager and the IT department.\n19. Non-Disclosure Requirements.\nThe written employment (including signed offers of employment) and engagement agreements with all\nCompany Personnel contain provisions regarding the non-disclosure and non-use of proprietary and/or\nconfidential information received by such Company Personnel during the term of the relationship with the\nCompany. Compliance with these provisions is mandatory. No Company Personnel entrusted with or\notherwise knowledgeable about information of a confidential or proprietary nature shall disclose that\ninformation outside the Company, either during or after employment or other service to the Company,\nwithout written Company authorization to do so. Such disclosure could be harmful to the Company or\nhelpful to a competitor. The Company’s Disclosure Policy, forming part of the Internal Compliance Plan,\nsets detailed guidelines and procedures with respect to any disclosure to a third party.\nNothing in this Code of Conduct prohibits Company Personnel from reporting possible violations of U.S.\nfederal law, Israeli law or any other foreign laws or regulations to any governmental agency or entity,\nincluding but not limited to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nrelevant Israeli authorities such as the Israeli Securities Authority, or making other disclosures that are\nprotected under the whistleblower provisions of U.S. federal or any foreign law or regulation.\n20. Reporting Channels.\nIf you suspect a colleague is violating the law or ZOOZ Power’s policies, or if you have been asked to\nengage in an illegal or unethical activity, or a question has arisen with regard to the legality of an action or\nPage 7 of 9\nfailure to act in a given situation, you must immediately report any such event. If you do not feel\ncomfortable speaking with your manager, you should turn to the Compliance Officer or the Chairman of\nthe Audit Committee on an anonymous or non-anonymous basis:\nCompliance Officer: the Company’s Chief Financial Officer\nYou should not worry about discrimination or retaliation as a result of coming forward. ZOOZ Power will\nnot tolerate discrimination or retaliation against any employee for raising a business practices issue in good\nfaith, if an employee has reported concerns in good faith, or provided information in an investigation.\nMoreover, no Company Personnel may threaten in any manner whatsoever or discourage any other\nCompany Personnel who, in good faith, makes, or intends to make, such reports. If you or others have\nexperienced an act of intimidation or retaliation you must report this behavior to the Compliance Officer\nimmediately.

This Code of Conduct addresses conduct that is particularly important to proper dealings with the\npeople and entities with which the Company interacts. From time to time the Company may adopt\nadditional policies and procedures with which Company Personnel are expected to comply.

(the “Company”) is an Israeli company whose ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). The Company is subject to the\nrequirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as a “foreign private issuer,” as such\nterm is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and various U.S. securities laws (“U.S. Securities\nLaws”) and to the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 5728-1968 (the “Israeli Securities Law”), as\na “dual listed” company, as such term is defined in the Israeli Securities Law. The following policies and\nprocedures of the Company are designed to ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of both the\nU.S. Securities Laws and Israeli Securities Laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Israeli Securities Authority (“ISA”), as well as the corporate\ngovernance requirements that apply to the Company pursuant to the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 and\nthe regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Companies Law”), the rules and regulations of Nasdaq (the\n“Nasdaq Listing Rules”) and applicable provisions of the TASE bylaws. Israeli Securities Law and U.S.\nSecurities Laws are referred to collectively as “Securities Laws” and all of these are referred to herein as\n“Applicable Law.”\nThe Company is committed to complying with Applicable Law and the requirements of the SEC and ISA. As\nmeans for internalizing and enforcing such compliance within the organization, the Company’s Board of\nDirectors resolved to establish, implement and enforce this Internal Compliance Plan (this “Compliance\nPlan”), as detailed herein. All directors, officers, employees, and full-time consultants of the Company and\nits subsidiary (“Company Personnel”) must be informed of and comply with this Compliance Plan. This\nCompliance Plan is intended, inter alia:\na. To explain the main provisions of Applicable Law and the implications and consequences of\nviolations thereof;\nb. To help Company Personnel in identifying situations and issues which could be problematic\nfrom the perspective of Applicable Law and to advise how to act in such situations;\nc. To set procedures designed to minimize potential violations of Applicable Law;\nd. To ensure implementation of the provisions of this Compliance Plan;\ne. To reduce the exposure of the Company Personnel to criminal, administrative and civil\nactions; and\nf. To provide methods that will enable the Company to identify and properly investigate an\nevent of non-compliance and take the appropriate measures for ensuring non-recurrence\nthereof.\nFor the purpose of preparing this Compliance Plan, and in connection with its annual review, an examination\nwas, and shall be, made consisting of a review of the requirements of all Applicable Law as well as analysis\nof the Company’s current procedures for Company Personnel who have the potential to result in a violation\nof such Applicable Law.\nOversight by Audit Committee\nThe Board of Directors has authorized and directed its Audit Committee (the “Committee”) to oversee this\nCompliance Plan. The Committee will monitor the Company’s efforts to implement this Compliance Plan,\nwill receive periodic updates, as necessary, from the Compliance Officer (as defined below) and will discuss\nsuch updates and assess the steps taken or that should be taken in response to matters that may arise from\ntime to time in connection with this Compliance Plan.\nPage | 3\nImplementation and Enforcement\nGeneral\nThe Company expects the strictest compliance with the policies and procedures forming this Compliance\nPlan by all Company Personnel, to the extent applicable. Failure to do so could result in embarrassment of\nthe Company, serious legal sanctions for individuals and/or the Company and loss of shareholder value. Such\nsanctions could include significant monetary penalties, a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public\ncompany and/or imprisonment. Accordingly, all Company Personnel are required to confirm in writing that\nthey have read and understood the policies that apply to them, as applicable (the Code of Business Conduct,\nDisclosure Policy and the Insider Trading Policy) and agree that they will comply with such policies.\nIt is the responsibility of the management of the Company to ensure implementation and enforcement of the\nCompliance Plan. The Committee, which has the general oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal\nand regulatory requirements, may initiate any compliance investigation as it deems appropriate.\nCompliance with the policies and procedures of this Compliance Plan is a condition of continued employment\nand/or engagement with the Company. Any Company Personnel who violates any aspect of this Compliance\nPlan may be subject to disciplinary action imposed by the Company, which may include dismissal for cause.\nA violation of a Company policy is not necessarily the same as a violation of law. The Company reserves the\nright to determine, in its own discretion and on the basis of the information available to it, whether its policy\nhas been violated, regardless of whether that specific conduct also violates the law. Accordingly, it is not\nnecessary for the Company to wait for the filing or conclusion of an administrative, civil or criminal action\nagainst the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\nThe Compliance Officer\nAppointment of a Compliance Officer\nThe Board of Directors has appointed a Compliance Officer, being the [Chief Financial Officer] of the\nCompany, who will be responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this Compliance Plan and the\nupdating thereof as necessary. In doing so, the Compliance Officer will act in coordination with the\nCompany’s Board of Directors, the Committee and management. The Compliance Officer will guide and\nadvise Company Personnel as will be necessary in order to promote compliance with all Applicable Law\nrelevant to their activity. Additionally, the Compliance Officer will be responsible for ensuring that violations\nare handled in accordance with the terms of this Compliance Plan.\nThe Compliance Officer is granted extensive powers, including access to all of the Company’s documents as\nwell as any Company Personnel’s records, in order to ensure adherence to this Compliance Plan and\ncompliance with Applicable Law.\nThe Board of Directors may remove from office or replace such appointed Compliance Officer in accordance\nwith applicable law.\nResponsibilities of the Compliance Officer\nThe general responsibilities of the Compliance Officer will be as follows (such responsibilities will be\ndescribed in further detail in the Compliance Plan Procedure):\n• Supervising dissemination of this Compliance Plan and monitoring its implementation and\nintegration;\n• Conducting periodic training sessions for Company Personnel;\nPage | 4\n• Ensuring signatures of employees and management of required procedures as well as ensuring\nparticipation in trainings;\n• Training of new Company Personnel;\n• Management of a special whistleblower hotline;\n• Reviewing and updating this Compliance Plan;\n• Management of violations of this Compliance Plan as detailed below;\n• Reporting timely to the Committee of any major issues raised through the\nwhistleblower hotline or otherwise revealed; and\n• Report at least annually to the Board of Directors.\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, the Compliance Officer will:\n• have access to all books and records of the Company and its subsidiary as she or he deems necessary\nto fulfill her or his duties under this Compliance Plan;\n• have the authority to instruct other Company Personnel, directly or indirectly through the manager of\nsuch employees, to take any action or refrain from taking any action which, in her or his judgment,\ncould result in a violation of this Compliance Plan;\n• routinely assess the effectiveness of this Compliance Plan and recommend to the Board of Directors\nany modifications that she or he sees fit based on, among other things, legal and regulatory\ndevelopments, changes within the Company that affect its risk profile and lessons learned from\nexperience;\n• maintain records for at least seven years of all documents relating to this Compliance Plan, including\nbut not limited to, copies of this Compliance Plan and all amendments thereto, notices from Company\nPersonnel regarding alleged violations, records of assessments of this Compliance Plan and\ninvestigations of alleged violations of Applicable Law or this Compliance Plan;\n• request the Committee to enlist the assistance of the Company’s internal auditor if she or he believes\nsuch assistance is warranted; and\n• be authorized to engage the assistance of outside advisors for questions that may arise in connection\nwith this Compliance Plan.\nHandling of Violations\nReceipt of Anonymous Reports\nThe Company’s management ascribes great importance to Company Personnel’s involvement in achieving\ncompliance with this Compliance Plan and its implementation. In order for the Company to ensure that this\nCompliance Plan and its procedures are fully implemented, and in order to identify and prevent potential\nviolations of the Company policies and procedures, the Company has initiated an efficient and effective\nmechanism for Company Personnel to report to the Compliance Officer and/or to the Chairman of the\nCommittee.\nAny Company Personnel who suspects or identifies a violation of the provisions of this Compliance Plan or\nany Company policies and procedures, has a duty to immediately report such suspected violation. The\nCompany undertakes that any Company Personnel who in good faith reports a violation of the provisions of\nthe law and its regulations, or a suspicion thereof, will not be discriminated or retaliated against as a result of\ncoming forward even if at the end of the investigation process it is discovered that no violation in fact was\ncommitted. The Company will not tolerate discrimination or retaliation against any person for raising a\nsuspected violation in good faith, or for providing information in an investigation. Moreover, no employee\nmay threaten in any manner whatsoever or discourage any other employee who, in good faith, makes such\nreports. If any Company Personnel or others have experienced an act of intimidation or retaliation each\nCompany Personnel must report this behavior to the Compliance Officer or to the Chairman of the Committee\nimmediately.\nPage | 5\nAn omission to report a violation when possessing knowledge thereof is a violation of this Compliance Plan\nand may result in disciplinary action against such non-reporting person.\nA report regarding a violation or a suspicion of a violation can be made anonymously, in accordance with the\nCompany’s Whistleblower’s Procedure (see Part II), however, a non-anonymous notification to the\nCompliance Officer is preferable since it would enable the Compliance Officer to obtain additional details\nand therefore handle the matter more effectively. The Company undertakes that in the event that any Company\nPersonnel approaches the Compliance Officer in a non-anonymous manner, his or her identity will be kept in\nconfidence by the Company, subject to the requirement of a competent authority such as a court of law or\nother governmental authority.\nAll reports will be handled in accordance with the Compliance Plan Procedure.\nIf, following an investigation, it is determined that a violation has indeed occurred, the Company will take\nsuch administrative, disciplinary and/or other actions against the violator as it deems appropriate.\nSummary\nThis Compliance Plan provides guidelines for dealing with concerns and difficulties in the corporate and\nsecurities fields which Company Personnel may encounter during their ongoing activities. All Company\nPersonnel are required to review carefully the principles specified in this Compliance Plan and act in\naccordance therewith.\nThe Company’s management views violations of Applicable Law severely and will investigate and handle\nany suspicion of any violation.\nIn any event of doubt, Company Personnel are encouraged to approach the Compliance Officer with any\nquestions they may have.\nFor the removal of any doubt, this Compliance Plan is an internal Company document, which does not have\nthe power to prevail over or change the provisions of law or to impose duties or obligations upon the Company\ntowards any third party whatsoever or to grant rights to any third party.\n* * * * *\nPage | 6\nPART II\nSECURITIES AND CORPORATE COMPLIANCE - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Policy\nThe Board of Directors has adopted and oversees the Company’s Disclosure Policy, set forth below, to\nprevent the selective or improper disclosure of material non-public information. This Disclosure Policy\nconstitutes a part of the Compliance Plan.\nPurpose\nZOOZ Power is a publicly listed company whose shares are held by a large base of investors, and which are\nlisted on the Nasdaq and TASE. As ZOOZ Power Personnel (for purposes of this Disclosure Policy, as defined\nbelow), we must ensure that we do not disclose any information regarding the Company that would unfairly\nor erroneously affect our business or the market price of ZOOZ Power shares. We are under a legal and moral\nobligation not to provide information to anyone outside the Company including financial analysts, trade\nanalysts, investors, potential investors or the press on a selective basis because such information could give\nan unfair advantage in buying or selling shares or other securities, if any, in advance, or in absence, of a public\nannouncement. We are also under a legal and moral obligation not to provide false or misleading information\nto the public, which could mislead investors in the buying or selling of our shares or other securities. Even\ncomments made casually “off the record” or on a “non-attribution” basis can cause major problems for the\nCompany.\nThis Disclosure Policy covers material disclosure in all documents and statements communicated in writing,\norally or electronically with analysts, investors, journalists, market professionals and the public.\nThe objective of this Disclosure Policy is to ensure that disclosure of relevant information regarding the\nCompany, including public communications about material events or developments concerning ZOOZ\nPower, are timely, accurate and disseminated in accordance with the Securities Laws and regulatory\nrequirements.\nSince ZOOZ Power’s securities are traded both on the Nasdaq and on the TASE, the Company aims to\ndisclose material information in such a way so that substantially the same disclosure is given in both markets\ncontemporaneously and such disclosure complies with the applicable rules of each market.\nThis Disclosure Policy should be considered together with ZOOZ Power’s Insider Trading Policy.\nWhom Does This Policy Cover\nThis Disclosure Policy applies to all directors, officers, employees (including part-time employees) and full-\ntime consultants of ZOOZ Power, and those authorized to speak on ZOOZ Power’s behalf (“ZOOZ Power\nPersonnel”). It will be posted on the Company’s sharepoint for access by all employees. All ZOOZ Power\nPersonnel will be expected to review and acknowledge understanding of this Disclosure Policy, and\ncommitment to comply therewith, when they join ZOOZ Power and thereafter on an annual basis.\nThis Disclosure Policy prohibits all ZOOZ Power Personnel from discussing material, non-public information\nwith anyone outside the Company (including family members, relatives or friends), except as permitted by\nthis Disclosure Policy. Even within the Company, material non-public information should be shared only on\na need-to-know basis.\nPage | 7\nViolation of the Policy\nAny ZOOZ Power Personnel who violates this Disclosure Policy may face disciplinary action, including\ntermination of his or her employment or engagement with ZOOZ Power. The violation of this Disclosure\nPolicy may also violate certain Securities Laws. If it appears that any ZOOZ Power Personnel has violated\nsuch Securities Laws, ZOOZ Power may refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory authorities or other\nlaw enforcement authorities.\nAvoid Illegal Disclosure\nAll ZOOZ Power Personnel, and in particular senior management, may be approached by financial and\nsecurities analysts, investors, reporters or Nasdaq or TASE representatives. The contact may be made\ninformally, whether verbally or in writing (including by email or via social media channels).\nFinancial and securities analysts, investors and reporters may be digging for, and may benefit from,\ninformation that has not been publicly or widely communicated. There is a distinct advantage in the market\nof being the first to get hold of and/or publicize any new information, including the utilization of material\nnon-public information for trading purposes.\nTo avoid the possibility of improper or illegal disclosure, no ZOOZ Power Personnel other than the Chairman\nof the Board (Chairman), the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and\nany other person specifically authorized by the foregoing in writing (the “Authorized Spokesperson(s)”),\nare permitted to speak to media, market professionals (e.g., securities analysts, institutional investors,\ninvestment advisors and brokers-dealers), security holders, Nasdaq and TASE representatives, or participate\nin IR-related seminars and conferences as a Company spokesperson.\nSimilarly, no electronic bulletin board posting, social media engagement, chat wire participation, or otherwise\nplacing of Company information, including potentially sensitive or confidential information on the internet,\nis permitted, unless specifically authorized in writing by an Authorized Spokesperson.\nZOOZ Power Personnel must not discuss confidential or material non-public information where it may be\noverheard, such as in airplanes, restaurants, elevators, restrooms and other public places. ZOOZ Power\nPersonnel should be aware that cellular phone conversations are often overheard, and that voice mail and e-\nmail messages may be retrieved by persons other than their intended recipients, if not carefully addressed.\nFurther, it is prohibited to induce or attempt to induce a person to purchase or sell securities by way of a false\nor misleading statement, promise or forecast, when the person delivering the information knows or ought to\nknow that the statement, promise or forecast is false or misleading.\nIt is also prohibited to induce or attempt to induce a person to purchase or sell securities by concealing material\nfacts.\nPublic Disclosure of Material Information\nAny time an Authorized Spokesperson determines to disclose or discuss Company information with anyone,\nparticularly any securities analyst, investment advisor, broker-dealer, investor or journalist, there must be a\ndetermination made whether the information is material.\nInformation is “material” for the purposes of the U.S. Securities Laws if such information, if publicly known,\nwould likely affect either the market price of the Company’s securities or a person’s decision to buy, sell or\nhold the Company’s securities. Under Israeli Securities Law, “inside information” includes information that\nis not known to the public and, if it were known to the public, would likely cause a significant change in the\nprice of the Company’s securities. Either positive or negative information may be material. Determination as\nto the materiality of the information will be made by the CFO and the Compliance Officer in consultation\nwith the CEO.\nPage | 8\nPossible material information or events related to the Company include, but are not limited to:\n• status (positive or negative) of existing material collaborations;\n• potential new material collaborations;\n• significant regulatory developments;\n• significant new products, product developments or discoveries;\n• the results, favorable or not, of litigation;\n• the gain or loss of a material contract, customer, license or collaboration;\n• a financing transaction;\n• quarterly or annual earnings results;\n• projections of future results or sales;\n• earnings or losses;\n• a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, joint venture or tender offer;\n• changes in dividend policies, a share split or anticipated public or private offerings of Company\nsecurities;\n• changes in senior management or control of the Company; and\n• impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems.\nIf a determination is made that the information that is going to be disclosed is material, unless provided\npursuant to a confidentially agreement, a press release or SEC filing, as well as TASE filing, must be issued\nbefore or at the same time that the information is disclosed to any third party, including analyst, broker-dealer\nor investor. The SEC filing, press release and TASE filing may either disclose the material information or, if\nit is issued prior to disclosure to any third party, may disclose that a conference call or webcast will be held\nto disclose the information. Any conference call or webcast must be given as much advance notice as\npracticable. On an ad hoc basis, the Compliance Officer may determine that certain information be disclosed\nas a report on Form 6-K in lieu of a press release.\nIf any ZOOZ Power Personnel who is not an Authorized Spokesperson believes that he or she may have\ndisclosed material nonpublic information to a person outside of the Company, such person must immediately\nnotify an Authorized Spokesperson of the information disclosed, the person(s) to whom the information was\ndisclosed, and any other pertinent information regarding the disclosure. Upon notification, the Authorized\nSpokesperson(s) will then determine, after consultation with the CFO and the Compliance Officer, whether\nthe information is material and, if so, disclose the information in the manner prescribed in this Disclosure\nPolicy.\nEarning Calls\nAdvance public notice of at least several days will normally be given of all quarterly earnings conference\ncalls or webcasts. Notice will include a press release issued to all major news wires and a posting on the\nCompany’s website with relevant information, including the date, time and telephone number for the earnings\ncall (pursuant to Nasdaq disclosure requirements). The press release will also state where a replay can be\naccessed and for how long, and this information will also be available on the Company’s website.\nAll communications by the Company during the course of the conference call shall be consistent with the\npress release that accompanied the conference call and/or with other prior public disclosures made by the\nCompany. The Company will not selectively disseminate any additional material nonpublic information after\na conference call and will only disclose new information on a conference call if the conference call is held in\ncompliance with applicable Securities Laws, which may include Regulation FD.\nPage | 9\nThe quarterly earnings conference call and/or webcast will be open to the public and generally scheduled on\na day which is a business day both in the United States and in Israel. The Chairman, the CEO and the CFO\nmay determine how many and which callers will be heard on the call and may further determine that only\ncertain financial analysts and institutional investors will be allowed to submit questions. Web replay will be\navailable within few days after the conference call and will be available for at least 90 days after the\nconference call.\nResponding to Market Rumors or Speculation – “NO COMMENT”\nIt is the policy of the Company not to comment on or respond to inquiries or rumors concerning prospective\ncorporate developments or transactions, future financial performance or unusual market activity in its\nsecurities. No ZOOZ Power Personnel may comment or substantively respond to any inquiry, market rumors\nor speculation. ZOOZ Power Personnel must immediately report such rumors to the CFO or Compliance\nOfficer. Rumors about the Company that are posted on internet chat rooms, message boards, social media\nnetworks or other media outlets are included in this Disclosure Policy.\nCompany Personnel will respond to any inquiry or rumor only with a statement to the effect that it is the\npolicy of the Company (i) not to comment on or respond to inquiries or rumors concerning prospective\ncorporate developments or transactions and shall refer the matter to an Authorized Spokesperson and (ii) not\nto reaffirm, other than through appropriate public disclosure, previous statements or guidance about future\nfinancial performance.\nIt is important for all Company Personnel and representatives to recognize that a statement to the effect that\nthey are “not aware of any information” or a denial that any development or transaction exists is not the same\nas the above statement. An acceptable reply requires a statement to the effect that “It is the policy of the\nCompany not to comment on or respond to inquiries or rumors concerning prospective corporate\ndevelopments or transactions or future financial performance.” A denial or statement of absence of knowledge\nwill undercut the ongoing effectiveness of the Company’s no comment policy, and if inaccurate, could result\nin liability as a false and misleading statement.\nIf the source of the rumor is found to be internal, the Compliance Officer should be consulted to determine\nthe appropriate response.\nResponsibility of Managers and Spokespersons\nManagers have the responsibility to inform all staff of their obligations and liabilities under this Disclosure\nPolicy.\nIt is the responsibility of the Authorized Spokespersons to be fully informed on all material activities, such\nas corporate operations, activity, strategy, new discoveries, market trends and company finances, to the extent\nthat such are relevant to the matters about which they are authorized to speak.\nAuthorized Spokespersons will be responsible for coordinating all press meetings and other interactions with\nthe press, industry media and analysts, including visits or scheduled phone calls with analysts, financial\nprofessionals or security holders. Any such scheduled communications may be conducted with a single\nAuthorized Spokesperson participating.\nAll written communications and presentations to analysts, financial professionals or security holders must be\napproved by an Authorized Spokesperson prior to dissemination of those materials. All scripts relating to\nconference calls involving analysts, financial professionals or security holders must be reviewed in advance\nby an Authorized Spokesperson.\nAuthorized Spokespersons may review financial analyst reports or projections and securities analyst reports\nsent to ZOOZ Power for comment. The Authorized Spokesperson reviewing the securities analyst reports\nPage | 10\nmay comment only on errors in the report or model that are based on publicly available historical facts and\nmay comment only when assumptions have been made on the basis of incorrect data that render unrealistic\nconclusions. Authorized Spokespersons may not comment on analysts’ forward-looking projections.\nNeither the Authorized Spokespersons, nor other ZOOZ Power Personnel, will distribute reports of securities\nanalysts to investors or the press, unless approved by the CEO or CFO, as distribution of analyst reports can\nbe interpreted as endorsing the forward-looking projections set out by the analysts in their reports. The\nCompany may make available on the Company’s website, a list, which may be distributed by ZOOZ Power\nPersonnel, of all analysts who cover the Company together with a link to each analyst’s website. If the\nCompany chooses to make such information regarding analysts available on its website, it must not selectively\ninclude information with respect to certain analysts only. Such information with respect to all analysts known\nto the Company to publish reports on the Company’s securities must be included.\nPress Release Disclosure Policy\nThe Company will issue a press release containing its results of operations for the last fiscal quarter or for the\nlast full year, promptly after the approval by the Board of Directors of such results. The Company will\nendeavor to issue such press releases prior to the open of the Nasdaq on the trading day following such\napproval.\nIn addition, the Company will issue a press release regarding new material developments, unless the CEO or\nthe CFO and Compliance Officer determine that such developments should remain confidential for the time\nbeing and appropriate control of that information is instituted along with ensuring that insider trading on such\ninformation is prevented. On an ad hoc basis, the Compliance Officer may determine that certain information\nbe disclosed on a Form 6-K in lieu of a press release.\nPress releases will be sent to Nasdaq in accordance with their applicable rules and disseminated through a\nnews wire service that provides widespread distribution and will be posted on the Company website promptly\nafter their release over the wire (pursuant to Nasdaq disclosure requirements). Press releases shall also be\npublished on the TASE in accordance with applicable Israeli Securities Law and its regulations.\nFor all material press releases, ZOOZ Power’s CFO and legal counsels shall submit such applicable periodic\nor current report filings or other applicable regulatory filings as required under the Securities Law and in\naccordance therewith.\nThe legal counsels should review all press releases and Reports on Form 6-K before they are distributed or\nfiled, especially earnings releases and any releases involving forward-looking statements.\nIf projections or other forward-looking statements will be made, they must be approved by the CEO, CFO\nand Compliance Officer. Care should be taken that such statements are reasonable and made in good faith.\nForward-looking statements should be identified as such and accompanied by a safe harbor paragraph with\nappropriate risk factors and a disclaimer against any duty to update.\nNo ZOOZ Power Personnel should confirm or modify a prior projection on a selective basis. If an Authorized\nSpokesperson wishes to refer back to a prior projection without implicitly confirming it, he or she should\nmake clear that the prior projection was as of the date it was given and is not being updated as of the time of\nthe subsequent statement.\nIf any ZOOZ Power Personnel learns of information that causes them to believe that a disclosure may have\nbeen misleading or inaccurate when made or may no longer be true, they should immediately report that\ninformation to the Compliance Officer or CFO.\nScientific Conferences and Panels – Designation of a “Designated Spokesperson”\nPage | 11\nVice presidents, principle scientists and other individuals with expert knowledge in a particular area may be\ndesignated by the CEO to present at scientific conferences and panels as necessary or appropriate (the\n“Designated Spokespersons”). When speaking to analysts, investors, and journalists, it is important to have\na broad picture of the Company. Thus, before speaking with analysts, investors or the press, the Designated\nSpokesperson must be fully briefed by the CEO or the CFO, or such other person as they may determine, on\ncorporate developments and the appropriate answer to expected questions.\nDesignated Spokespersons will not respond to financial and/or forward-looking statements/questions and will\nnot make any comment regarding non-public issues.\nContact with Financial Market Analysts and Investors\nThe Designated Spokespersons may engage in “one-on-one” communications with financial market analysts\nand investors solely for the purpose of clarifying previously disclosed information. In no event shall any\nmaterial nonpublic information be disclosed (including by way of updating), nor shall any previous financial\nguidance or forecasts be confirmed under facts and circumstances that make the confirmation itself material,\nunless such information, update or confirmation is contemporaneously made available to the public in a\nmanner consistent with this Disclosure Policy.\nIn the course of any “one-on-one” or “limited-access” conversation, any Designated Spokesperson may\neducate financial market analysts and investors about the Company using previously disclosed historical\nfactual information or facts that are generally known to the public. The Spokesperson may not, however,\ndisclose estimates of the Company’s share price.\nExceptions\nExceptions to this Disclosure Policy may be made only with the prior approval of the CEO, CFO or\nCompliance Officer. However, and except as set out below, Company Personnel and representatives may\ndiscuss internal Company matters with, or disseminate internal Company information to, third parties in the\nordinary course of business as required in the performance of their Company duties or as approved by the\napplicable supervisor.\nNotwithstanding the preceding, Company Personnel and representatives will not disclose non-public\ninformation to other Company Personnel nor to anyone outside of the Company who has not executed\nappropriate confidentiality arrangements.\nRecords of Disclosure Documents\nAll documents relating to the disclosure of information about ZOOZ Power’s operations, activities and\nfinances will be kept on file (either in soft or hard copy) by the offices of the CEO, CFO or Compliance\nOfficer for a period of seven years. The file of disclosure documents should include the following items:\npress releases, management speeches and logs of analyst calls.\nQuestions on Disclosure Policy\nZOOZ Power Personnel are encouraged to direct any questions on disclosure issues, including the\nimplementation of this Disclosure Policy or the relevant regulations of the SEC or ISA to the CFO or\nthe Compliance Officer, as appropriate.\nPage | 12\nZOOZ POWER LTD.\nDISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nI. Objective and Scope\nThis document describes the Disclosure Controls and Procedures (as defined in 17 CFR 240.13a-15(e) or 240.15d-\n15(e)) (“Disclosure Controls”) established by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer\n(“CFO”), with the assistance of the Compliance Officer. The CFO and Compliance Officer oversee the Disclosure\nControls to ensure that material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company and/or its\nsubsidiary is fully and accurately disclosed in the United States and Israel on a timely basis and broadly\ndisseminated, all in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nThese Disclosure Controls cover disclosure in all documents and statements communicated by the Company in\nwriting, orally or electronically to analysts, broker-dealers, investors and the public and constitute a part of the\nCompliance Plan.\nSince the Company’s securities are traded both on the Nasdaq and on TASE, the Company aims to disclose material\ninformation in such a way so that substantially the same disclosure is given in both markets contemporaneously and\nsuch disclosure complies with the applicable rules of each market.\nII. Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls\nFrom time to time, but at least annually, the CEO and the CFO, with the assistance of the Compliance Officer, will\nreview these Disclosure Controls to evaluate and confirm their effectiveness and, if and to the extent they deem fit,\namend them.\nIII. Annual Reports\nIn preparing the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F (the “Annual Report”), the Company will comply with\nthe following controls and procedures, as may be modified by the CEO and the CFO (and in accordance with\napplicable law), with the assistance of the Compliance Officer from time to time, as they deem fit:\n1. Supervision: The CFO and the Compliance Officer will oversee, supervise and coordinate the process;\n2. Filing Date: In order to allow enough time to prepare a full and accurate disclosure document, the CFO and\nthe Compliance Officer will ensure that the process of preparing the Annual Report allows sufficient time for the\nCEO, CFO and other applicable management personnel of the Company to review the draft Annual Report;\n3. Timeline: Within no more than thirty (30) calendar days following the end of each fiscal year of the\nCompany, the CFO and the Compliance Officer will prepare a timeline briefly setting forth (i) the principal action\nitems for the preparation of the Annual Report, (ii) the projected date of each such action item, and (iii) the officers\nand employees, as well as outside parties, such as independent auditors and outside counsel(s), who are responsible\nfor performing each such action item;\n4. Allocation of Responsibilities: The CFO and the Compliance Officer will designate, direct and assign,\nwhere he or she deems appropriate, individuals or entities, internal or external, as applicable, to prepare and/or\nreview specific sections or items of the Annual Report, taking into account the position, experience and/or expertise\nof such individual or entity (the “Reviewers”);\nPage | 13\n5. Collection and Flow of Information: Each Reviewer will collect the information (under the responsibility\nof such Reviewer) to be disclosed in the Annual Report by way of communicating with appropriate employees and\nadvisors as he or she deems fit. This information (or comments to the disclosure of such information) will be\nfurnished by such Reviewer by providing written comments to the draft Annual Report (or portion thereof) presented\nto such Reviewer, or as otherwise directed by the CFO or the Compliance Officer;\n6. Risk Assessment: As part of the CFO’s and the Compliance Officer’s review of the draft Annual Report,\nthey will specifically discuss and identify the key risk areas of the Company. In doing so, the CFO and the\nCompliance Officer will review and evaluate the “Risk Factors” section of the Annual Report, and make updates or\namendments thereto, as they deem fit;\n7. Materiality of Information: The CFO and the Compliance Officer will determine the materiality of the\ninformation gathered by the Reviewers for the purpose of disclosure in the Annual Report, subject to Applicable\nLaw. In order to ensure that material information is collected and furnished to the CFO and the Compliance Officer\non a consistent and timely basis and throughout the fiscal year preceding each Annual Report, the CFO and the\nCompliance Officer have adopted the Disclosure Policy; and\n8. External Advisors: In order to ensure accurate disclosure and compliance with all applicable laws, the\npreparation of the Annual Report will be supported by the Company’s independent auditors, outside legal counsel(s)\nand such additional service providers as the CFO and the Compliance Officer deem fit. The scope of such support\nwill be as determined and directed by the CFO or the Compliance Officer, as relevant.\nIV. Other Reports and Disclosure Documents\nIn preparing the Company’s other reports and disclosure documents (including its proxy statements and\nprospectuses), the Company will comply with the relevant controls and procedures set forth in Article III above,\nsubject to applicable modifications appropriate under the circumstances, as the CFO and the Compliance Officer\ndeem fit. The Company’s procedures and controls with respect to issuing press releases are set forth in the Disclosure\nPolicy and the 6-K, Magna and Press Release Procedure.\nV. Disclosure Policy\nAs an integral part of these Disclosure Controls, the Board of Directors has adopted a Disclosure Policy, which will\nbe disseminated to the Company’s directors, officers and employees and other individuals as more fully set forth in\nthe Internal Compliance Plan. As part of the CEO’s, the CFO’s and the Compliance Officer’s periodic review of\nthese Disclosure Controls, they will also evaluate the Disclosure Policy and, to the extent they deem fit, will\nrecommend to the Board of Directors how to amend them.\nVI. Securities Laws Filings\nThe Compliance Officer will select and oversee the financial printer that serves as the Company’s EDGAR filing\nagent with respect to SEC filings. With respect to each press release issued to the public by the Company, the\nCompliance Officer, together with the CFO and/or the CEO, will determine whether and, if so, when, such press\nrelease will be submitted to the SEC on a Form 6-K and to what extent any portion thereof will be incorporated by\nreference into the Company’s then effective registration statements.\nAny document submitted or filed by the Company with the SEC will be filed contemporaneously in Israel via the\nMAGNA filing system. The Company will maintain at least two employees who are trained to effect MAGNA\nfilings. Press releases shall also be published on the TASE in accordance with applicable Israeli Securities Law and\nits regulations.\nAny document filed with the SEC by a shareholder of the Company on Schedule 13D or Schedule 13G will, upon\nthe Company becoming aware of such filings, be promptly filed by the Company in Israel via the MAGNA filing\nsystem.\nPage | 14\nVII. Enforcement\nAny employee who violates or refuses to comply with these Disclosure Controls may face disciplinary action,\nincluding, but not limited to, termination of his or her employment with the Company. The violation of these\nDisclosure Controls may also violate certain Securities Laws. If it appears that an employee may have violated such\nSecurities Laws, the Company may refer the matter to the appropriate regulatory or other law enforcement\nauthorities.\n* * *\nPage | 15\nZOOZ POWER LTD.\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nEffective as of April 4, 2024\nThis Insider Trading Policy (this “Policy”) provides guidelines to all personnel, including directors, officers,\nemployees and consultants (“Company Personnel”), of ZOOZ Power Ltd. and its subsidiary (“ZOOZ Power” or\nthe “Company”), for transactions* in the Company’s securities** and the handling of confidential information about\nthe Company and others with which it does business.\nAll Company Personnel should read this Policy very carefully. Failure to observe the prohibitions and\nprocedures set forth below could result in serious legal enforcement actions, both civil and criminal, for you\nand possibly the Company under both United States and Israeli Law. In addition, failure to comply with this\nPolicy may subject you to Company-imposed sanctions, including dismissal, regardless of whether or not\nsuch failure to comply with this Policy results in a violation of law.\nPOLICY\nAs a public entity, whose ordinary shares are listed on Nasdaq and the TASE, ZOOZ Power is subject to certain\nprovisions of United States federal securities laws and regulations, as well as Israeli securities laws and regulations.\nPursuant to these laws and regulations, “insider trading”, which is the use of material information about the\nCompany that is not known to the investing public, and, if it were known to the public, would likely cause a\nsignificant change in the price of the Company’s securities (such information is referred to in this Policy as\n“material non-public information,” and is more fully explained in Section 3 of the Guidelines below (the\n“Guidelines”)), including, for example, for personal benefit or for the benefit of others or to “tip” others who might\nmake an investment decision on the basis of such information, is illegal. You can be held liable both for your own\ntransactions and for transactions effected by a tippee, or even a tippee of a tippee. Furthermore, it is important that\nthe appearance of insider trading in securities be avoided. It is the policy of the Company to comply with all insider\ntrading laws and regulations.\nRESPONSIBILITY\nCompany Personnel may create, use or have access to material non-public information. Each individual has an\nimportant ethical and legal obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information, not to engage in any\ntransactions in the Company’s securities while in possession of material non-public information and not to provide\nsuch information or an opinion on any security of the Company while in possession of material non-public\ninformation to any person who – the person delivering such information knows or has reasonable grounds to believe\n– will make use of the such information or will utilize the opinion for purposes of a transaction or will pass it on to\nanother. Company Personnel or Related Parties (as defined in Section 2 of the Guidelines) may, from time to time,\nhave to forego a proposed transaction in the Company’s securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction\nbefore the Company Personnel learned of the material non-public information and even though he or she may suffer\nan economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting. Trading in securities in violation of these requirements or\nproviding others with material non-public information (whether or not you derive any benefit from such actions or\nwere aware of the intent by such persons to trade), may subject you to severe civil and criminal penalties, in addition\nto disciplinary action by the Company as more fully set out in Section 14 of the Guidelines.\nThe Chief Financial Officer is our Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer is responsible for the\nadministration of this Policy. If you have any questions about specific information or proposed transactions, or as\nto the applicability or interpretation of this Policy or the propriety of any desired action, you are encouraged to\ncontact the Compliance Officer. Do not try to resolve uncertainties on your own.\n* “transaction” may also include the exercise of options (see Section 7 of the Guidelines) and a commitment to do\nany transaction in the securities of the Company, whether the person making any of the foregoing is acting on its\nown behalf or on the behalf of another person or through an agent or a trustee.\nPage | 16\n** All types of “securities” are covered by this policy, including ordinary shares, partnership interests, futures,\noptions and all forms of debt securities (e.g., bonds, notes, debentures), whether or not convertible or exchangeable.\nRemember, however, the ultimate responsibility for complying with this Policy and avoiding improper transactions\nrests with you. In this regard, it is imperative that you use your best judgment.\nA claim of lack of understanding of the Company’s policies or of governing legal standards in this sensitive area\nwill not excuse any non-compliance.\nGUIDELINES\n1. Prohibition. In general, United States and Israeli securities laws and/or this Policy prohibit Company\nPersonnel from:\na) buying, selling or otherwise trading (including for the benefit of another) in the Company’s securities\nwhile in possession of material non-public (or “inside”) information;\nb) communicating (or “tipping”) such information to third parties, including family members, friends,\nsocial acquaintances and anyone who lives in your household;\nc) recommending any transaction in the Company’s securities while in the possession of material\ninformation that has not been publicly disclosed by the Company (under Israeli law, an actual trade\nis not required);\nd) assisting anyone engaged in any of the above activities; and\ne) answering questions or providing material non-public information about the Company and its affairs\nto Company outsiders unless you are specifically authorized to do so or it is a regular part of your\nposition, as further detailed under the Company Disclosure Policy.\nThis prohibition also applies to material, non-public information about, and the securities of, other\ncompanies (e.g., collaboration partners, customers or suppliers, or companies with whom ZOOZ Power has a\nbusiness relationship) with which the Company has a relationship.\nThere are no exceptions to this Policy other than those described in Section 7 of the Guidelines. For\nexample, if you possess material non-public information, you are prohibited to engage in transactions in the\nCompany’s securities even if such transactions are otherwise necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such\nas personal financial commitments or the need to raise money for a personal emergency expenditure).\n2. Transactions by Family Members; Entities Controlled by You. The prohibitions outlined in this\nPolicy also apply to your family members, others living in your household and any entities under your or your\nfamily member’s control (“Related Parties”). Company Personnel are expected to be responsible for the\ncompliance of all Related Parties to this Policy.\n3. Material Non-Public Information.\nMaterial Information. Information is “material” for the purposes of the United States securities laws and this Policy\nif such information, if publicly known, would likely affect either the market price of the Company’s securities, for\nbetter or for worse, or a person’s decision to buy, sell or hold the Company’s securities. Certainly, if the information\nmakes you want to trade, it would probably have the same effect on others. If you possess material (and non-public)\ninformation, you may not trade in a company’s share, advise anyone else to do so or communicate the information\nto anyone else until you know that the information has been publicly disseminated. Under Israeli law, “inside\ninformation” includes information that is not known to the public and, if it were known to the public, would likely\ncause a significant change in the price of the Company’s securities.\nNon-public Information. Non-public information is any information that has not been disclosed effectively to the\ninvesting public. Disclosure by press release or in the Company’s reports that it files with the SEC and ISA is\nnecessary to make the information public. For information to be considered public, it must not only be disclosed\npublicly, but there also should be sufficient time for the investing public to absorb and evaluate the information\nbefore you trade in the Company’s securities. Although timing may vary depending upon the circumstances and\nPage | 17\njurisdiction, a good rule of thumb is that information is considered non-public until one full trading day has passed\nafter public disclosure. If the information released is complex, such as a prospective major financing or other\ntransaction, it may be necessary to allow additional time for the information to be absorbed by the investing public.\nIn such circumstances, you will be notified by the Compliance Officer regarding a suitable waiting period before\ntrading in the event it differs from the Company’s standard policy.\nEither positive or negative information may be material. No simple “bright line” test exists to determine when\ninformation is material; assessments of materiality involve a highly fact-specific inquiry and will be more often\nthan not determined in hindsight based by the impact on the share price. For this reason, you should direct any\nquestions about whether information is material to the Compliance Officer. Although it is not possible to list all\ntypes of material information, the following are a few examples of information that is particularly sensitive and\nshould be treated as material:\n• the status (positive of negative) of material existing collaborations;\n• potential new material collaborations;\n• significant regulatory developments;\n• significant new products, product development or discoveries;\n• the results, favorable or not, of litigation;\n• the gain or loss of a material contract, customer, license or collaboration;\n• a financing transaction;\n• quarterly or annual earnings results;\n• projections of future results or sales;\n• earnings or losses;\n• a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, joint venture or tender offer;\n• changes in dividend policies, a stock split or the offering of additional securities;\n• changes in senior management; and\n• impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems.\nThe Company emphasizes that this list is merely illustrative. If you have any question as to whether particular\ninformation is material or non-public, you should not trade or communicate the information to anyone without prior\napproval by the Compliance Officer. Remember, however, the ultimate responsibility for complying with this\nPolicy and avoiding improper transactions rests with you.\n4. “Tipping.” Company Personnel also are prohibited from recommending or suggesting to anyone\nelse (including Related Parties or friends) to buy, sell or hold the securities of any company, including those of the\nCompany, while they are in the possession of material non-public information of the Company or other companies,\nas relevant. In fact, Company Personnel should not recommend to any other person that they buy, sell or hold\nsecurities of the Company, even when not in possession of material non-public information, because such a\nrecommendation could be imputed to the Company and could be misleading if such Company Personnel is not\naware of all relevant information. It is the Company’s policy to prohibit the disclosure of non-public information\nto any person, whether inside or outside the Company, unless the person receiving such information has a legitimate\nneed to know such information and is subject to a confidentiality agreement.\n5. Short-term, Speculative Transactions. The Company has determined that there is a substantial\nlikelihood for the appearance of improper conduct by Company Personnel when they engage in short-term or\nspeculative securities transactions. Therefore, Company Personnel are prohibited from engaging in any of the\nfollowing activities involving the Company’s securities, except with the prior written consent of the Compliance\nOfficer:\na) purchasing the Company’s securities on margin (borrowing money from a stock broker to fund the\nsecurities purchase);\nb) pledging Company securities;\nc) short sales (selling short is a practice of selling more securities than you own, a technique used to speculate\non a decline in the securities price);\nPage | 18\nd) buying or selling puts or calls (a put is a right to sell at a specified price a specified number of securities\nby a certain date and is utilized in anticipation of a decline in the security price. A call is a right to buy at\na specified price a specified number of securities by a certain date and is utilized in anticipation of a rise\nin the security price). The only equity securities of the Company that may generally be purchased or sold\nby Company Personnel are the Company’s ordinary shares; and\ne) engaging in derivative transactions relating to the Company’s securities (e.g., exchange traded options\netc.).\nThis prohibition is not intended to apply to transactions that may involve one or more of the foregoing activities if\nthose transactions are entered into solely for the purpose of deferring the effective date of a sale for tax or other\nnon-speculative purposes. Thus, entering into so-called costless collars or forward sale transactions in which the\neconomic terms of the transaction are not subject to the future control of Company Personnel and are established\nat the time the transaction is entered into do not require the prior consent of the Compliance Officer. Please note,\nhowever, that entering into any such transaction must be done at a time when trading in the Company’s securities\nis permitted. Where because of the unique nature of the proposed transaction or its complexity it is not clear whether\nthere is a substantial likelihood for the appearance of improper conduct, Company Personnel should seek the\nconsent of the Compliance Officer before entering into it.\n6. Influencing a Security’s Price. It is prohibited to fraudulently influence the price of securities (such\nas by placing fictitious purchase or sale orders to create an impression of large demand or supply thereby intending\nto cause an increase or decrease in the price of the security). Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, the person committing such a fraudulent act may be subject, for each such fraudulent act, to fines of not\nmore than $5,000,000 or imprisonment of not more than 20 years, or both, except that when such person is a person\nother than a natural person, a fine not exceeding $25,000,000 may be imposed. In addition, the person committing\nthe fraudulent act may also expose him/herself to a civil action by the party who suffered damages as a result of the\nfraudulent acts. Therefore, Company Personnel are strictly prohibited from committing any acts or omissions which\nconstitute or could constitute such manipulation of the Company’s securities and the Compliance Officer must be\nupdated without delay in any event of a suspicion that such an act was committed.\n7. Certain Exceptions. The exercise of options for the purchase of securities under any Company option\nplan is exempt from this Policy, because the other party to the transaction is the Company itself and the price does\nnot vary with the market but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement or the plan. Nevertheless, based on recent\nlegal bulletin of the ISA, the exercise of options for the purchase of securities under any Company option plan is\nexempt only if, among others, the exercise price of the option is below the market price of the share at the time of\nexercise and if the exercise is made immediately prior to the expiration of the option. However, the securities so\nacquired may not be sold, except in accordance with this Policy.\n8. Blackout Periods.\nCompany Personnel and Related Parties are restricted from trading in Company securities at certain times\nthroughout the year as described below (“Blackout Period/s”).\nCompany Personnel and Related Parties may not buy, sell or otherwise trade (including for the benefit of another)\nin Company securities during the period commencing fourteen (14) days before the end of each fiscal quarter and\nending at the close of two full trading day in the U.S. after the Company publicly discloses its results for the\npreceding fiscal period.\nIt should be noted that even during permitted trading periods (“Trading Windows”), any Company Personnel or\nRelated Party possessing material non-public information concerning the Company shall not engage in any\ntransactions in the Company’s securities until such information has been known publicly for at least one full trading\nday. Furthermore, there are times when the management of the Company may be aware of a material non-public\ndevelopment but at its discretion does not disclose it to all Company Personnel. Although you may not know the\nspecifics of the development, if you engage in a trade before such development is resolved or disclosed to the public\nyou might expose yourself and the Company to a charge of insider trading that could be costly and difficult to\nrefute. In addition, a trade by you during such time could result in adverse publicity for the Company. Therefore,\nPage | 19\nthe Company may from time to time prohibit any transactions in Company securities for specified periods, even\nduring Trading Windows. This notice may be given to all Company Personnel or to Company Personnel involved\nwith specific matters. In the event you are informed of any such Blackout Period, you should treat such notification\nin itself as material non-public information and it should not be disclosed to any third party.\nEach person is individually responsible at all times for compliance with the prohibitions against insider trading.\nTrading in the Company’s securities during Trading Windows should not be considered as “safe harbor,” and all\nCompany Personnel should use good judgment at all times.\nSpecific exceptions may be made, with prior approval, in special situations when the Company Personnel does not\npossess material non-public information or the exception would not otherwise contravene the law or the purposes\nof this Policy. Any request for an exception will be directed to the Company’s Compliance Officer.\n9. Trading Plans. The restrictions set forth above will not apply to sales made pursuant to a Qualified\nSelling Plan. For purposes of this exception, a “Qualified Selling Plan” is a written plan, contract or instruction for\nselling the Company’s shares which meets each of the following requirements:\n(1) the plan is adopted by the Company Personnel during a period when sales are permitted\npursuant to this Policy;\n(2) the plan is adopted during a period when the Company Personnel adopting the plan is not in\npossession of material non-public information;\n(3) the plan is adhered to strictly by the Company Personnel;\n(4) the plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or\ndelegate discretion on these matters to an independent third party;\n(5) at the time it is adopted the plan conforms to all other requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the\nU.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as then in effect;\n(6) the plan provides that the sales be effected on Nasdaq or any other stock market located outside\nIsrael; and\n(7) the plan provides that the sales be effected via a non-Israeli broker (although coordination with\nan Israeli affiliate, branch or agent of such broker will be permitted).\nOnce the Qualified Selling Plan is adopted, (i) Company Personnel may not exercise any influence over the amount\nof securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the dates of the trade and (ii) such plan may be\nterminated or altered only during a period that complies with the description in each of subsections (1), (2) and (5)\nabove.\n10. Confidentiality Guidelines. To provide more effective protection against the inadvertent disclosure of\nmaterial non-public information about the Company or others with which the Company does business, the Company\nhas adopted the following guidelines in addition to the prohibitions above. These guidelines are not intended to be\nexhaustive and should be read together with the Company’s Disclosure Policy. Additional measures to secure the\nconfidentiality of information should be undertaken as deemed necessary under the circumstances. If you have any\ndoubt as to your responsibilities with respect to confidential information, please seek clarification and guidance\nfrom the Compliance Officer before you act.\nThe following guidelines establish procedures with which Company Personnel should comply in order to maximize\nthe security of confidential information:\nPage | 20\na) do not discuss internal Company matters or developments with anyone outside the Company or even with\nother Company Personnel, except as required in the performance of your regular duties and provided the\nrecipient is subject to a confidentiality agreement;\nb) do not discuss any Company matter in public places, such as airplanes, elevators, hallways, restrooms or\neating facilities, where conversations might be overheard;\nc) use passwords to restrict access to the information on computers; and\nd) limit access of others to particular locations or physical areas where material non-public information is\nlikely to be documented or discussed.\n11. Authorized Disclosure of Material Non-Public Information. If any Company Personnel receives\ninquiries about the Company from securities analysts, reporters or others, he or she should decline comment and\ndirect them to the Company’s CEO, CFO or other authorized spokesperson of the Company, as further detailed in\nthe Company’s Disclosure Policy.\n12. Presumption of Insider Trading Under Israeli Law. Under Israeli law, if a director or other office\nholder, treasurer or internal auditor of the Company, any other person assuming the responsibilities of the foregoing\npersons under a different title, any shareholder holding at least 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding share\ncapital or voting rights or having the right to appoint at least one director, or a family member or entity controlled\nby any of the them, purchases securities of the Company within three months of the date that he or she sold securities\nof the Company (or sells securities of the Company within three months of the date that he or she purchased\nsecurities of the Company), it would be presumed that such person used inside information, and such person would\nhave the burden to prove that he or she did not use inside information. Therefore, although this Policy does not\nprohibit purchases and sales by such individuals within a three-month period, this Policy strongly discourages such\npractice.\n13. Reporting Violations. If you know or have reason to believe that this Policy or the special trading\nprocedures described above have been or are about to be violated, you should immediately bring the actual or\npotential violation to the attention of the Compliance Officer. Such information may be conveyed on an anonymous\nbasis pursuant to the Company’s Whistleblower Procedures, but sufficient details should be given to enable a proper\ninvestigation.\n14. Penalties for Violations.\nUnder United States securities laws, an individual may be subject to criminal fines of up to $5,000,000 and up to\ntwenty years of imprisonment for violating the securities laws by engaging in transactions in securities at a time\nwhen they are in possession of material non-public information. In addition, the SEC may seek the imposition of a\ncivil penalty of up to three times the profits made, or losses avoided from the trading. Insider traders must also\ndisgorge any profits made and are often subjected to an injunction against future violations. Violators can also be\nbarred from serving as officers or directors of public companies. Finally, under some circumstances, individuals\nmay be subjected to civil liability in private lawsuits. In addition, under Israeli law, individuals may be subject to\ncriminal penalties of up to NIS 1,130,000 and up to five years of imprisonment as well as administrative sanctions\nof up to NIS 2,000,000 and corporations may be subject to criminal penalties of up to NIS 5,650,000.

The Act also requires employers to set up procedures allowing\nemployees to report, confidentially and anonymously, concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing\nmatters, including any circumstances where it is believed that fraud or other irregularities may be occurring within\nthe company. ZOOZ Power owes it to its shareholders and employees to ensure fair and accurate financial reporting\nand to report any issues that might hinder that objective.\nAccordingly, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) of the Company will receive and\nact on complaints and concerns (“Complaint/s”) regarding, but not limited to, the following matters:\n(a) questionable activities, practices or policies relating to accounting matters, audits of financial statements\nor internal control over financial reporting, including fraud practices;\n(b) non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n(c) other irregularities or deficiencies in the management of the Company’s business or violations or potential\nviolations of any of the Company’s policies and procedures; and\n(d) retaliation against employees who make Complaints (a “Retaliatory Act”).\nComplaints should be reported to and handled by the Committee. Employees should not discuss these matters with\nany other employee other than, at such employee’s discretion, his/her immediate supervisor or the Compliance\nOfficer, nor should employees attempt to verify the matter of their own accord.\nIn the discretion of the Committee and its Chairperson, any responsibilities of the Committee created by these\nprocedures may be delegated to its Chairperson.\nProcedures for Making a Complaint\nComplaints regarding any of the above categories can be mailed in a sealed envelope addressed to “Audit Committee\n- Complaints” and placed in a second envelope addressed to Compliance Officer, or Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee, on an anonymous or non-anonymous basis:\nCompliance Officer:\nChief Financial Officer\nThe Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors:\nMrs. Naama Zeldis\nAlternatively, you may report such events to the anonymous Whistleblower Compliance Hotline (the “Hotline”).\nThe Hotline is operated by a third-party service provider, which the Company has retained to receive such reports,\nthe contact details for which are below. You may make such reports on a completely anonymous and\nconfidential basis by contacting the Hotline. Reports made to the Hotline will, in turn, be provided directly to the\nCommittee and the internal auditor on an anonymous and confidential basis. The Hotline may be reached 24 hours\na day, 7 days a week at the following toll-free number and internet address:\nContact Information for the Whistleblower Compliance Hotline:\nPage | 23\nToll-Free Telephone Number [-----]\nHotline Internet Address [-----]\nProcedures for Receiving a Complaint\nEach Complaint received by the Committee, whether forwarded to the Committee by the Compliance Officer, its\nChairman or management or made directly to the Committee, whether openly, confidentially or anonymously, will\nbe reviewed by the Committee, who may, in its discretion, consult with any member of management, the Company’s\nadvisers and/or advisers engaged for this purpose. The Committee will then determine whether an investigation is\nwarranted and, if so, whether the Committee itself or management should investigate the Complaint, taking into\naccount the specific circumstances and nature of the Complaint.\nIf the Committee determines that the Complaint should be investigated, it will notify the Company’s Compliance\nOfficer and/or CEO, of that conclusion. Management or such other party, as authorized by the Committee, will\nthereafter promptly investigate the Complaint and will report the results of its investigation to the Committee. The\nCommittee, or management, pursuant to authorization by the Committee, may engage the Company’s outside\ncounsel, internal auditor and/or external auditor and/or special counsel, accountants and/or other experts to assist in\nthe investigation and in the analysis of results, provided that the engagement of the Company’s external auditor will\nbe subject to the Committee’s pre-approval policy.\nWho Should Investigate a Complaint\nIn determining whether management or the Committee should investigate a Complaint, the Committee will consider,\namong any other factors that are appropriate under the circumstances, the following:\n1. Who is the alleged wrongdoer? If an executive officer, senior financial officer or other high management\nofficial is alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing, that factor alone may militate in favor of the Committee,\nor a party authorized by it, conducting the investigation.\n2. How serious is the alleged wrongdoing? The more serious the alleged wrongdoing, the more appropriate that\nthe Committee should undertake or supervise the investigation. If the alleged wrongdoing would constitute a\ncrime involving the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, that factor alone may militate in\nfavor of the Committee conducting or supervising the investigation.\n3. How credible is the allegation of wrongdoing? The more credible the allegation, the more appropriate that\nthe Committee should undertake or supervise the investigation. In assessing credibility, the Committee should\nconsider all facts surrounding the allegation, including but not limited to whether similar allegations have\nbeen made in the press or by analysts or other third parties.\nProtection of Whistleblowers\nConsistent with Company policy and applicable law, the Committee will not retaliate, and will not tolerate any\nintimidation or retaliation by management or any other person or group, directly or indirectly, against anyone who,\nin good faith, makes, or intends to make, a Complaint, reports a Retaliatory Act or provides assistance to the\nCommittee, management or any other person or group, including any governmental, regulatory or law enforcement\nbody, investigating a Complaint. The Committee will not, unless compelled by judicial or other legal process, reveal\nthe identity of any Company Personnel who makes a Complaint and who asks that his or her identity, as the person\nwho made such Complaint, remain confidential and will not make any effort, or tolerate any effort made by any\nother person or group, to ascertain the identity of any person who makes a Complaint anonymously.\nRecords\nPage | 24\nThe Committee will retain all records relating to any Complaint or report of a Retaliatory Act and to any\ninvestigation of any such report for a period of seven years.\n* * *\nPage | 25\nZOOZ POWER LTD.\nThe Work of the Board of Directors and its Committees\nThis guideline is intended to regulate and assist the ongoing conduct of the Company’s Board of Directors and its\ncommittees, with the intention of ensuring efficient conduct in managing the meetings and the decision-making\nprocesses.\nBoard of Directors\n• The Board is authorized to design the Company’s policies and supervise the performance of the Chief Executive\nOfficer of the Company (the “CEO”)1. Among its duties, the Board:\no approves the Company’s financial needs and determines its credit needs;\no approves the Company’s business plan;\no approves the Company’s financial statements;\no reports to the shareholders about the Company’s operations and results;\no appoints and dismisses the CEO;\no approves transactions as per the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 and the regulations promulgated\nthereunder (the “Companies Law”), the provisions or the Company’s Articles of Association; and\no decides on distributions to shareholders.\n• Such powers of the Board may not be delegated to the CEO2.\n• The Board will consist of up to 14 directors but no less than five (5) directors unless otherwise determined by\nthe annual general meeting of the Company’s shareholders.\nChairman of the Board\n• The Board may from time to time elect one of its members to be the Chairman of the Board, remove such\nChairman from office and appoint another in his place.\n• The Chairman of the Board will preside at every meeting of the Board, but if there is no such Chairman, or if\nat any meeting he is not present within 15 minutes of the time fixed for the meeting, or if he is unwilling to\ntake the chair, the Directors present will choose from among themselves one person to be the chairman of such\nmeeting3.\nBoard Meetings\n• The Board will convene meetings as required to fulfill its duties and the needs of the Company, but in any\nevent shall convene at least one meeting in every three-month period and may meet and adjourn its meetings\nand otherwise will regulate its meetings and proceedings as the Board thinks fit4.\n• The Chairman of the Board may, at any time, convene a Board meeting, provided that a notice will be given to\nall other directors a reasonable time prior to the applicable meeting. Notwithstanding, the Board may convene\nwithout prior notice in urgent cases only if the majority of the directors has approved to do so5.\n1 Section 92(a) to the Companies Law\n2 Section 92(b) to the Companies Law\n3 Article 52 to the Company’s Articles of Association\n4 Article 50(a) to the Company’s Articles of Association\n5 Section 98 to the Companies Law\nPage | 26\n• Any director, who is not the Chairman of the Board or the CEO, may at any time request the Chairman to\nconvene a meeting of the Board, provided that a notice will be given to all directors not less than twenty-four\n(24) hours before any meeting unless such notice is waived.\nBoard Committees\n• The Board, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, may delegate any or all of its powers, to\ncommittees, each consisting of two or more persons (all of whom must be directors).\n• If a committee is assigned one or more powers of the Board, then it must include at least one external director6\n- to the extent that the Board has external directors.\n• Unless otherwise expressly provided by the Board in delegating powers to a committee, such committee may\nnot be empowered to further delegate such powers.\n• The Board may not delegate the following powers to a committee7:\no determining general policies of the Company;\no distributions to shareholders, except for repurchases of shares within a framework set by the Board;\no determining the position of the Board on a matter that requires shareholder approval or an opinion on a\nspecial tender offer pursuant to Section 329 of the Companies Law;\no the appointment of directors, to the extent the Board is entitled to appoint directors;\no the issuance of shares or convertible securities or debentures, with a limited exception for employee\ncompensation;\no the approval of financial statements; and\no the approval of transactions and actions requiring Board approval pursuant to Sections 255 and 268-275\nof the Companies Law.\n• Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to applicable law, the Board may establish committees for advisory\npurposes only with respect to any of the foregoing matters, which may also include members who are not\nmembers of the Board and in which an external director will not be required to be a member (to the extent that\nthe Board has external directors).\nAudit Committee under the Companies Law\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an audit committee, the\nfunctions of which should be8:\n• to examine deficiencies in the management of the Company’s business, including in consultation with the\nCompany’s internal auditor and/or the Company’s external auditor, and to recommend remedial measures to\nthe Board. If it finds any such deficiencies that are material, the Audit Committee will conduct at least one\nmeeting on the matter in the presence of the internal auditor or external auditor and excluding office holders\nwho are not members of the Audit Committee, other than if they are requested to be present in order to a\nintroduce their position in a matter which is under their responsibility;\n• to decide for specified reasons whether actions pursuant to Section 255 of the Companies Law are material or\nnot, and to decide whether transactions as set forth in Section 270(1), (4) and (4A) of the Companies Law are\n“extraordinary transactions” or not, and it may take such decision with respect to certain types of transactions\nin accordance with predetermined standards to be approved annually;\n6 Section 243 to the Companies Law\n7 Section 112(a) to the Companies Law; however, a Board committee may make recommendations to the\nBoard with respect to those matters (section 112(c))\n8 Section 117 to the Companies Law\nPage | 27\n• to decide whether transactions set forth in Section 270(4) or (4A) of the Companies Law, even if not\n“extraordinary transactions”, need to undergo a competitive process under the supervision of the Audit\nCommittee or any other party determined thereby based on certain criteria or any other processes that the Audit\nCommittee shall determine prior to the approval of these transactions;\n• to review and, when appropriate, approve certain related party actions and transactions in accordance with\nSections 255 and 268 through 275 of the Companies Law;\n• to determine the manner by which “non-negligible” transactions are approved, including setting those\ntransactions that will nevertheless be subject to the Audit Committee approval and determining the relevant\ncriteria for such transactions once a year if the Audit Committee so elects;\n• where the internal auditor’s work plan is required to be approved by the Board, to examine such work plan\nprior to its presentation to the Board and to propose amendments thereto;\n• to examine the internal audit system of the Company and the performance of the internal auditor, and to ensure\nthat the internal auditor has the necessary resources and tools at his disposal to perform his duties, based on the\nCompany’s special needs and size;\n• to examine the scope of work and fees of the external auditor of the Company and to make recommendations\nin connection thereto; and\n• to make arrangements for “whistleblower” procedures in the Company which will allow Company Personnel\nto make complaints regarding deficiencies in the management of the Company’s business and to provide\nprotection for “whistleblowers”.\nThe Audit Committee composition requirements referred to under the Companies Law are not applicable to the\nCompany as the Board of Directors, as part of its decision to take relief from the requirement under the Companies\nLaw to appoint external directors, also adopted reliefs from such composition requirements on the basis that the\nCompany complies and will be required to continue to comply with the Nasdaq majority board independence\nrequirement and with US Securities Law and Nasdaq Rules concerning the composition of the Audit Committee\n(see below).\nAudit Committee under U.S. Securities Law and Nasdaq Rules\nThe Rules and regulations promulgated by Nasdaq (the “Nasdaq Rules”) specify that the Company must have an\nAudit Committee comprised of at least three members, each of whom must:\n• be independent9;\n• meet the further independence criteria established under U.S. Securities Law for Audit Committee members\n(see below);\n• not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary\nduring the past three years; and\n• be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee must have at least one member who has past employment experience in finance\nor accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or any other comparable experience or background\nwhich results in the individual’s financial sophistication, including being or having been a CEO, CFO or other senior\nofficer with financial oversight responsibilities. Furthermore, U.S. Securities Law has adopted rules which impose\nadditional, more stringent independence requirements applicable to Audit Committee membership. Under the Rule\n10A-3 of the Exchange Act, in order to be considered independent, an Audit Committee member may not, other\nthan in his or her capacity as a member of the board or any committee thereof, (i) accept, directly or indirectly, any\nconsulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the company or any subsidiary or (ii) be an affiliate of the\ncompany or any subsidiary thereof.\n9 As defined in Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2).\nPage | 28\nThe roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are also set forth in U.S. Securities Law and the Nasdaq Rules.\nUnder the Nasdaq Rules, the Audit Committee’s purpose is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting\nprocesses of the Company and the audits of its financial statements. Specific responsibilities are set forth in U.S.\nSecurities Law and Nasdaq Rules, and include:\n• responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent auditors10;\n• ensuring the receipt from the auditors of a formal written statement delineating all relationships between the\nauditor and the company;\n• actively engaging in dialogue with the auditor with respect to any disclosed relationships that may impact the\nauditor’s objectivity or independence;\n• taking, or recommending that the board take, appropriate action to oversee the independence of the outside\nauditor;\n• approving all related party transactions11; and\n• establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the company\nregarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters and the confidential anonymous\nsubmission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\nNasdaq Rules also specify that the responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to be set forth in a written charter.\nThe Audit Committee is to review and reassess the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis.\nCompensation Committee under Israeli Law\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of any Israeli company whose shares are publicly traded must\nappoint a compensation committee (“Compensation Committee”), which is responsible for12:\n• making recommendations to the board of directors with respect to the approval of the compensation policy (see\nbelow) and any extensions thereof;\n• periodically reviewing the implementation of the compensation policy and providing the board of directors\nwith recommendations with respect to any amendments or updates thereto;\n• reviewing and resolving whether or not to approve (subject to approval of the board of directors, and, in certain\ncases, the approval of company’s shareholders) arrangements with respect to the terms of office and\nemployment of “office holders”13; and\n• determining whether or not to exempt a transaction with a candidate for CEO from shareholder approval.\nThe terms of office and employment of office holders (other than directors and the CEO) require the approval of\nthe Compensation Committee and the board of directors, provided such terms are in accordance with the company’s\n10 As the Companies Law empowers the shareholders to appoint and remove the external auditor in practice, the\nappointment and removal of the external auditor should be recommended by the Audit Committee and then approved\nby the Board and then the shareholders.\n11 Such transactions may also be approved by another independent body of the board.\n12 Section 118B to the Companies Law\n13 Pursuant to the Companies Law, the term “office holder” includes the CEO, general manager, deputy chief executive\nofficer, vice president and any other person fulfilling or assuming any of the foregoing positions without regard to such\nperson’s title, as well as a director or manger directly subordinated to the CEO.\nPage | 29\ncompensation policy. Shareholder approval is also required if the compensation of such officer is not in accordance\nwith such policy. However, in special circumstances the Compensation Committee and then the board of directors\nmay nonetheless approve such compensation even if such compensation was not approved by the shareholders,\nfollowing a further discussion and for detailed reasoning.\nIn addition, amendment of existing terms of office and employment of office holders who are not directors requires\nthe approval of the Compensation Committee only, if it determines that such amendment is not material.\nThe terms of office and employment of directors and the CEO should be approved by the Compensation Committee,\nboard of directors and shareholders, by a special majority (except for approval of terms of office and employment\nof directors which are consistent with the company’s compensation policy and require approval by a regular\nmajority). Such special majority should include (i) at least a majority of the shareholders who are not controlling\nshareholders and who do not have a personal interest in the matter, present and voting, or (ii) the non-controlling\nshareholders and shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the matter who were present and voted against\nthe matter hold two percent or less of the voting power of the company. Notwithstanding the above, in special\ncircumstances the Compensation Committee and then the board of directors may nonetheless approve compensation\nfor the CEO, even if such compensation was not approved by the shareholders, following a further discussion and\nfor detailed reasoning.\nAs with the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee composition requirements referred to under the\nCompanies Law are not applicable to the Company as the Board of Directors adopted relief from such requirements,\non the basis that the Company complies, and will be required to continue to comply, with the Nasdaq majority board\nindependence requirement and with US Securities Law and Nasdaq Rules concerning the composition of the\nCompensation Committee (see below).\nCompensation Committee under Nasdaq Rules\nThe Nasdaq Rules specify that each listed company must have a Compensation Committee comprised of at least\ntwo members, each of whom must:\n• be independent (as defined above); and\n• not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the company or any\nsubsidiary thereof.2\nIn determining whether a director is eligible to serve on the Compensation Committee, Nasdaq rules also require\nthe board of directors to determine whether the director is affiliated with the Company or an affiliate thereof and to\ndetermine whether such affiliation would impair the director’s judgment as a member of the Compensation\nCommittee.\nUnder the Nasdaq Rules, the compensation of the CEO and all other executive officers14 must be determined, or\nrecommended to the full board for determination, by a Compensation Committee comprised solely of independent\ndirectors. Furthermore, the CEO may not be present during the voting or deliberations with respect to his or her\ncompensation arrangements.\nNasdaq Rules also specify that the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are to be set forth in a written\ncharter. The Compensation Committee is to review and reassess the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis.\n2“Executive officer” is used in the Nasdaq Rules as defined in the Exchange Act and the SEC rules.\nPage | 30\nNomination and Corporate Governance Committee under Nasdaq Rules\nThe Nasdaq Rules specify that director nomination decisions are to be made by a majority of the independent\ndirectors in a vote in which only independent directors participate, or by a committee comprised solely of\nindependent directors.\nThe purposes of the Company’s Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee are to:\n• oversee the Company’s corporate governance functions and provide recommendations to the Board regarding\ncorporate governance issues;\n• identify, evaluate and recommend to the Board candidates to serve as directors of the Company consistent with\nthe criteria approved by the Board; and\n• serve as a focal point for communication between director candidates, non-committee directors and the\nCompany’s management.\nThe full list of responsibilities of our Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee are set forth in a written\ncharter, as required under Nasdaq Rules.\nPage | 31\nCompliance Plan Procedure\nGoal:\nThis Compliance Plan Procedure sets forth the work plan of the Compliance Officer, the Company’s management\nand Human Resources department, in connection with the implementation and enforcement of the Compliance Plan,\nand the handling of violations, including, guidelines, supervision procedures and detailed reporting procedures.\nResponsibilities of the Compliance Officer:\nCirculation of Materials:\nOnce a year, the following documents will be circulated to all employees: The Compliance Plan and the Code of\nBusiness Conduct.

It provides kinetic energy storage systems - flywheels - to enable ultra-fast EV charging. \n\nAs EV adoption grows, the demand for ultra-fast charging is increasing. However, the higher power levels required for ultra-fast charging are expected to exceed the capacity of today's grid transmission and distribution systems in many areas.\n\n\"At ZOOZ Power we are solving the bottleneck between growing ultra-fast charging needs and limited grid capabilities by providing our bridging solution that maximises existing grid capacities until full grid enhancements can be implemented,\" Udi Tzuri, ZOOZ Power's Head of Product, tells Auto Futures.\n\nIts flagship product is a flywheel-based power booster, the ZOOZTER-100, which enables continuous ultra-fast electric vehicle (EV) charging without grid upgrades.\n\n\"It supplements the grid's power with bursts of stored kinetic energy. This allows ultra-fast EV chargers to operate at their full charging speeds using a combination of grid power and the ZOOZTER's added power boost - circumventing the need for immediate grid upgrades to enable ultra-fast charging,\" he explains.\n\nThe ZOOZTER 100 works by storing kinetic energy in a high-speed steel flywheel rotating at 17,000 rpm inside a sealed vacuum chamber. The vacuum environment and magnetic bearings minimise friction and energy losses, providing up to 200,000 high-power charge/discharge cycles over a 15-year lifespan.\n\nWhen it comes to power boosting and energy storage for EV charging, flywheels offer several advantages over chemical batteries.\n\n\"Unlike batteries that have a limited number of charge/discharge cycles (often less than 5,000) before needing replacement, flywheels can provide up to 200,000 high-power charge/discharge cycles over a 15-year lifespan,\" says Tzuri.\n\n\"This significantly reduces the need for frequent replacements, lowering operational costs and minimising environmental impact from battery disposal. Additionally, flywheels store energy mechanically as rotating kinetic energy, eliminating the use of toxic and flammable chemicals found in batteries.\"\n\nThe ZOOZTER 100 system is designed primarily for grid connection, but it is compatible with on-site electricity generation from wind and solar.\n\n![ZOOZ Power s Udi Tzuri](https://preview.thenewsmarket.com/Previews/ATFR/StillAssets/640x480/671811.JPG)\n\n## Supporting The Transition to EVs\n\nAt present, ZOOZTER 100 systems are operating in three sites in Israel, in partnership with Afcon and Dor-Alon – the country’s leading ultra-fast charging network operators. Previously the sites were limited due to the available grid power.\n\nThe technology is also used on four sites in Germany, in collaboration with Mer and Parkstrom.\n\n\"In the US we are soon starting pilots with New York Power Authority (NYPA) in upstate New York and with a big car rental company at LaGuardia airport. We have more projects in the pipeline with major CPOs (Charge Point Operators) and fleet operators, which we will announce once finalised. Stay tuned for more updates!\" says Tzuri.\n\nMoving forward the strategy is to partner with leading CPOs, fleets and energy companies in every region.\n\n\"The easily relocatable nature of our power boosters is a key selling point in our international expansion. This feature maximises value for our partners and accelerates charging infrastructure rollout, allowing us to quickly enter new markets and adapt to changing needs.\"\n\n\"By focusing on these strengths, we aim to position ourselves as a global leader in enabling rapid, flexible deployment of ultra-fast charging infrastructure, supporting the worldwide transition to electric vehicles,\" he adds.\n\n![ZOOZ Power s Udi Tzuri](https://preview.thenewsmarket.com/Previews/ATFR/StillAssets/640x480/671809.jpg)\n\n## Bridging The Charging Gap\n\nBy the end of the decade, ZOOZ envisions a transformed EV charging landscape with widespread networks of ultra-fast charging stations capable of delivering 150kW to 350kW or higher.\n\n\"This will support the growing number of EVs and make long-distance travel as convenient as with ICE vehicles,\" says Tzuri.\n\n\"However, a significant challenge remains in getting there - the mismatch between the power demands of these stations and existing grid capabilities. While grid enhancements will be ongoing, they require substantial time and investment. Power boosting technologies will play a crucial role in bridging this gap. By supplementing grid power with stored energy, they'll enable ultra-fast chargers to operate at full speed even in locations with grid constraints.\"\n\n\"By 2030, EV charging will be faster, more widely available, and more responsive to user needs, with power boosting technologies playing a key role in supporting this growth,\" concludes Tzuri.\n\nTags \n\n  * [ZOOZ Power](Tags?tags=ZOOZ Power)\n  * [Udi Tzuri](Tags?tags=Udi Tzuri)\n\n\n\n  * [ ](javascript:void\\(window.open\\('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=The+Israeli+Company+Boosting+Ultra-Fast+Charging+Infrastructure+With+Flywheel+Technology+-+ZOOZ+Power&url=https://www.autofutures.tv/news-features/the-israeli-company-boosting-ultra-fast-charging-infrastructure-with-flywheel-technology---zooz-powe/s/f764d034-ad4e-4996-b8ea-99a06a7e442b', width=800,height=600\\)\\))\n  * [ ](javascript:void\\(window.open\\('https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.autofutures.tv/news-features/the-israeli-company-boosting-ultra-fast-charging-infrastructure-with-flywheel-technology---zooz-powe/s/f764d034-ad4e-4996-b8ea-99a06a7e442b', width=800,height=600\\)\\))\n  * [ ](javascript:void\\(window.open\\('https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.autofutures.tv/news-features/the-israeli-company-boosting-ultra-fast-charging-infrastructure-with-flywheel-technology---zooz-powe/s/f764d034-ad4e-4996-b8ea-99a06a7e442b', width=800,height=600\\)\\))\n  * \n\n\nCopy link Copy\n\nPopular Categories\n\n[Autonomous Driving](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=autonomous%20driving)\n\n[Business](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=Business)\n\n[Connectivity](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=Connectivity)\n\n[Electrification](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=Electrification)\n\n[Startups](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=Startups)\n\n[Tech Innovation](https://www.autofutures.tv/Tags?tags=Tech%20Innovation)\n\n[SEE MORE](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n\nadding all to cart\n\nFalse 0\n\nFile added to media cart.\n"

The ZOOZTER-100 stores energy in a high-speed steel flywheel that spins at 17,000 rpm, housed in a vacuum chamber with magnetic bearings to minimize friction and energy loss. This setup allows the system to perform up to 200,000 charge/discharge cycles over a 15-year lifespan. During EV charging, the flywheel acts as a generator, providing additional energy that the grid cannot supply on its own, making it possible to install ultra-fast chargers in areas with weak grid infrastructure.\n\nThe deployment of ZOOZ Power’s technology at the Dor-Alon station exemplifies its effectiveness. Initially constrained by a grid capacity of 300 kW, Dor-Alon could only support one 150 kW ultra-fast charger and two 100 kW chargers. By integrating the ZOOZTER-100, the station upgraded to four 150 kW ultra-fast chargers, significantly enhancing its charging capacity and utilization. This upgrade not only increased the number of cars charged daily but also reduced charging times, demonstrating the practical benefits of ZOOZ Power’s solution.\n\nZOOZ Power’s Energy Management System (EMS) plays a crucial role in maximizing site revenue for Charge Point Operators (CPOs) by optimizing power loads, reducing peak power consumption, and increasing charging capacity. The EMS ensures faster charging times, which attract more customers and enable higher charger utilization. Additionally, it helps CPOs avoid higher demand charges by managing peak power consumption, thereby lowering operational costs and boosting profit margins.\n\nFlywheel technology offers several advantages over traditional chemical batteries for energy storage in EV charging. Unlike batteries that degrade after a limited number of cycles, flywheels can endure up to 200,000 high-power charge/discharge cycles, significantly reducing the need for replacements and minimizing environmental impact. Flywheels store energy mechanically, avoiding the use of toxic and flammable chemicals, making them a more sustainable and cost-effective solution.\n\nLooking ahead, ZOOZ Power is focused on perfecting its current products and scaling production for future growth.

As a publicly traded company, ZOOZ Power balances innovation with profitability, leveraging strategic partnerships to drive sustainable growth and deliver value to shareholders while pioneering the future of EV charging.\n\nAutomotive Industries interview with Udi Tzuri, VP Product, ZOOZ Power\n\nAutomotive Industries: Hi Udi, can you explain how ZOOZ Power’s flywheel-based power boosters work to enable ultra-fast EV charging despite grid limitations?\n\nTzuri: ZOOZ Power develops and markets revolutionary power boosters that supplement the grid with extra power to make it easier and faster to charge electric vehicles (EVs) and to deploy Ultra-fast charging anywhere. Our main product, the ZOOZTER-100, is a flywheel-based system that enables ultra-fast EV charging without needing costly upgrades to the power grid.\n\nHere’s how it works: The ZOOZTER-100 stores energy in a high-speed steel flywheel that spins at 17,000 rpm inside a vacuum chamber with magnetic bearing. This setup reduces friction and energy loss, allowing the system to perform up to 200,000 charge/discharge cycles over 15 years. When an EV is charging, the flywheel powers as a generator to provide extra energy, enabling rapid charging speeds that the grid alone can’t handle. It connects to a standard 3-phase grid connection, so it can be installed even in areas with weak grid infrastructure.\n\nAutomotive Industries: What were the main challenges encountered during the deployment of the Power Boosting solution at the Dor-Alon Station on Route 6, and how were they overcome?\n\nTzuri: Dor Alon is a great example of how our ZOOZTER technology can overcome grid limitations to maximize EV charging potential. Originally, they had a grid capacity of 300 kW, with one ultra-fast 150 kW charger and two 100 kW chargers. These chargers were almost always in use, but they couldn’t add more due to the grid’s capacity limits.\n\nBy integrating the ZOOZTER-100, we enabled Dor Alon to upgrade to four 150 kW ultra-fast chargers. This change significantly increased overall utilization, allowing more cars to charge each day and reduced charging times.\n\nThe initial challenge was proving our technology’s effectiveness. We set up a pilot site to demonstrate that the ZOOZTER system worked as promised. Once the customer saw the results and the technology risk was eliminated, they expanded our solution to two more sites on Route 6, one of Israel’s busiest roads, each handling over 100 charging sessions daily.\n\nAutomotive Industries: How does ZOOZ Power’s Energy Management System (EMS) contribute to maximizing site revenue for Charge Point Operators (CPOs) at ultra-fast charging sites?\n\nTzuri: ZOOZ Power’s Energy Management System optimizing the power load available for charging from both the grid and the ZOOZTER ,it boosts revenue for Charge Point Operators (CPOs) and enables fleet operators to save money at ultra-fast charging sites by:\n\nEnhanced Customer Experience and Revenue – Faster Charging: Reducing charge times from 45 minutes to 10-15 minutes attracts more customers or charge more fleet cars. This quick service maximizes charger use and encourages purchases at nearby businesses, increasing site revenue or cost saving.\n\nAvoiding Higher Demand Charges – Peak Shaving: the ZOOZTER reduces peak power consumption, lowering demand charges and cutting costs, which increases profit margins.\n\nIncreased Charging Capacity – More Chargers, More Revenue for CPO and less expanses for fleet: For example, Dor Alon increased its capacity from one ultra-fast charger and two slower ones to four ultra-fast chargers with the ZOOZTER-100, allowing more cars to be charged simultaneously and boosting overall revenue.\n\nBy managing power loads efficiently, ZOOZ Power’s booster and EMS enhances customer satisfaction, reduces costs, and increases charging capacity, significantly boosting revenue for CPOs. By integrating ZOOZ Power’s solution , CPOs can optimize energy usage, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately maximize revenue while minimizing operational and upgrade costs.\n\nAutomotive Industries: Could you elaborate on the specific benefits of using flywheel technology in your power boosters compared to other technologies available in the market?\n\nTzuri: When it comes to power booster or energy storage for EV charging, flywheels offer several advantages over alternatives such as chemical batteries. Unlike batteries that have a limited number of charge/discharge cycles (often less than 5,000) before needing replacement, flywheels can provide up to 200,000 high-power charge/discharge cycles over a 15-year life. A typical high utilization site regime leads to a large number of charging cycles in tens or even hundreds of vehicle charges per day, which will limit the life of the batteries to a single number of years: this significantly reduces the need for frequent replacements, lowering operational costs and minimizing environmental impact from battery disposal.\n\nAdditionally, flywheels store energy mechanically as rotating kinetic energy, eliminating the use of toxic and flammable chemicals found in batteries. Flywheels’ fast response time, longer lifetimes, lower environmental footprint, and potentially lower operational costs make them a more sustainable and cost-effective solution as power boosters in EV charging applications.\n\nAutomotive Industries: What are some key technological advancements or innovations that ZOOZ Power is currently focusing on to further improve its power boosting solutions?\n\nTzuri: ZOOZ is currently focused on perfecting our existing product and making its production scalable for future growth.
