That’s according to a new [report](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-homebuying-demand-thanksgiving/) from Redfin ([redfin.com](http://redfin.com)), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. \n\nOne reason for the outsized increase is that early-stage homebuying demand, including home tours, boomed in the two weeks following the presidential election. But another notable reason is that Redfin is comparing it to a period in 2023 that included Thanksgiving, a time of year when home sales are typically very slow. \n\nRedfin will know in the next few weeks whether the increase in pending sales is a Thanksgiving mirage or a sign of sustained strength in the housing market. \n\nMortgage purchase applications are up 12% week over week, though home tours and other early-stage signals have tapered off. Redfin’s Homebuyer Demand Index—a measure of tours and other buying services from Redfin agents—fell to its lowest level in over two months during the week ending November 24, though it’s up 7% year over year. The recent dip in early-stage demand follows two weeks of big upswings; the demand index hit its highest level in nearly a year and a half in mid-November. \n\nOn the selling side, new listings are up 10.6% year over year, the biggest increase since April. That’s also due partly to the fact that Thanksgiving fell into last year’s comparable period. Like the surge in pending sales, Redfin will know more soon about whether the improvement in new listings is here to stay. \n\nFor Redfin economists’ takes on the housing market, please visit Redfin’s “[From Our Economists](https://www.redfin.com/news/from-our-economists/)” page. \n\n**Leading indicators**\n\n**Indicators of homebuying demand and activity**  \n---  \n**Value (if applicable)** |  **Recent change** |  **Year-over-year change** |  **Source**  \n**Daily average 30-year fixed mortgage rate** |  6.95% (Nov. 26)  |  Down from 7.08% one week earlier  |  Down from 7.3%  |  Mortgage News Daily   \n**Weekly average 30-year fixed mortgage rate** |  6.81% (week ending Nov. 27)  |  Highest level since July  |  Down from 7.29%  |  Freddie Mac   \n**Mortgage-purchase applications (seasonally adjusted)** |  Up 12% from a week earlier (as of week ending Nov. 22)  |  Up 52%  |  Mortgage Bankers Association   \n**Redfin Homebuyer Demand Index (seasonally adjusted)** |  Down 5% from a month earlier  (as of week ending Nov. 24)  |  Up 7%  |  Redfin Homebuyer Demand Index a measure of tours and other homebuying services from Redfin agents   \n**Touring activity** |  Down 8% from the start of the year (as of Nov. 25)  |  At this time last year, it was down 42% from the start of 2023  |  ShowingTime, a home touring technology company   \n**Google searches for “home for sale”** |  Unchanged from a month earlier (as of Nov. 25)  |  Unchanged  |  Google Trends   \n  \n**Key housing-market data**\n\n**U.S. highlights: Four weeks ending Nov. 24, 2024** _Redfin’s national metrics include data from 400+ U.S. metro areas, and is based on homes listed and/or sold during the period.

Nearly the same share (19%) say they have worked a job they hated to afford rent. \n\nOne in seven (14%) renters have used a cash gift from family to pay rent. Renters also report dipping into money that was earmarked for retirement to pay their housing costs. More than one in 10 (13%) pulled money out of retirement funds early, and 12% contributed less to retirement savings. \n\nWhile U.S. rents have [flattened out](https://www.redfin.com/news/rental-tracker-september-2024/) over the last year, rents are much higher than they were before the pandemic. Because rental prices have surged faster than wages, it’s more difficult than it used to be for Americans to afford rentals, [particularly](https://www.redfin.com/news/apartments-for-rent-under-1000/) lower-income Americans. Rental affordability may improve in the near future, with prices already showing signs of losing steam as more newly constructed apartments come on the market. \n\nEven though it’s difficult for many Americans to make their rent payments, renting is a popular choice because affordability has become even more strained for people looking to buy a home. A [separate Redfin analysis](https://www.redfin.com/news/renter-household-growth-q3-2024/) found that the number of renter households is growing three times faster than homeowner households, largely because the cost of buying has increased faster than the cost of renting. \n\nThis is according to a Redfin-commissioned survey conducted by Ipsos in September 2024, fielded to 1,802 U.S. residents aged 18-65. \n\nTo view the full report including a chart and additional methodology, please visit: <https://www.redfin.com/news/survey-how-renters-afford-housing>\n\n**About Redfin**\n\nRedfin ([www.redfin.com](https://www.redfin.com/)) is a technology-powered real estate company.

In Florida, investor purchases posted double-digit declines amid an ongoing climate and insurance crisis._\n\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NASDAQ: RDFN) — Real estate investors purchased 2.3% fewer homes in the third quarter than they did a year earlier, according to a new [report](https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-stabilize-q3-2024/) from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. The small size of the change is notable because it comes after four years of huge swings driven by the wild pandemic-era housing market. For instance, investor purchases surged as much as 144% year over year in 2021, then dropped as much as 47% last year. \n\nInvestor home purchases have settled near pre-pandemic levels of around 50,000 per quarter, with typical seasonal ups and downs. Investors bought 49,380 homes in the third quarter, compared with 50,535 last year. By comparison, investors were buying nearly 100,000 homes per quarter during the 2021 homebuying frenzy. \n\nIn dollar terms, investors purchased $38.8 billion worth of homes in the third quarter. That’s up 3.4% from a year earlier, similar to the increase in home-sale prices over the same period. \n\nIn September, 8.3% of home listings were from investors, down marginally from 8.7% a year earlier but up slightly from the pre-pandemic share. \n\n“Investors are finding a balance after several years of whiplash: They bought up homes at a frenzied pace in 2021 and the beginning of 2022, then quickly backed off when the housing market slowed as mortgage rates rose,” said Redfin Senior Economist Sheharyar Bokhari. “Now there’s a middle ground. It’s less appealing to buy homes to flip or rent out than it was at the start of the pandemic, when demand from both homebuyers and renters was robust. But it’s more appealing than it was last year, when soaring home prices and borrowing costs put a big damper on demand.” \n\nThere are a few key reasons investor activity is settling back to pre-pandemic levels: \n\n  * It’s harder for investors to buy homes, then sell them for a big profit than it was during the pandemic because home prices and loan costs are high. The typical home sold by an investor in October went for 55% more ($181,567) than the investor bought it for. That’s down from a 64% gain a year earlier. But interest rates are lower than a year ago and [homebuying demand](https://www.redfin.com/news/demand-bounces-back-after-election/) has improved a bit over the last few months. Investors who flip homes are still reaping bigger gains than they were before the pandemic, when homes bought by investors were selling for roughly 45% more. Just 7% of homes bought by investors sold for a loss in October; shortly before the pandemic, the norm was about 10%. \n  * A glut of new apartment supply hitting the market has put a lid on rent growth, meaning it’s less lucrative to buy a rental property than it was during the pandemic. But there is strong demand for rentals, largely becauseit’s hard for individuals to afford to buy a home. In fact, the number of renter households is growing [three times faster](https://www.redfin.com/news/renter-household-growth-q3-2024/) than that of homeowner households. Rents have stabilized over the last year, but they’re still [much higher](https://www.redfin.com/news/rental-tracker-october-2024/) than they were before the pandemic–and rents are rising quickly on the East Coast and in the Midwest. \n\n\n\n**Investors Bought 16% of Homes That Sold in the Third Quarter, the Lowest Share in 4 Years**\n\nReal estate investors purchased 15.9% of U.S. homes that sold in the third quarter. That’s the lowest share since the end of 2020, though it’s down just incrementally from 16.2% a year earlier. \n\nInvestors’ market share has fallen to near pre-pandemic levels: In the third quarters of both 2018 and 2019, investors bought roughly 14% of homes that sold. \n\nInvestor market share hit a record high of 20.9% at the start of 2022, when investors were taking advantage of low mortgage rates to buy up properties during the pandemic-driven moving boom. Market share is evening out now because the number of homes investors are buying has returned to around pre-pandemic levels. \n\n**Investor Purchases Are Falling Fast in Florida**\n\nWhile investor purchases are stabilizing nationwide, they are falling fast in some metros and rising quickly in others. \n\nInvestor purchases fellmost in Fort Lauderdale, FL, where they declined 23.8% year over year. Next come Newark, NJ and Miami, which each posted 19.4% declines. \n\nInvestors are backing off from buying homes in Florida for similar reasons individuals are [backing off](https://www.redfin.com/news/florida-home-sales-fall-2024/): Florida has become a less desirable place to live as the intensity and frequency of natural disasters increase. Additionally, home insurance and HOA fees are skyrocketing. \n\nIn Las Vegas, investor purchases rose 27.6% year over year in the third quarter–the biggest _increase_ of any metro in this analysis. Next come Seattle, where investor purchases rose 21.8%, and San Jose, CA, where they rose 19.5%. \n\n**Investor Purchases of Condos Fell 11.4% Year Over Year**\n\nInvestor purchases of condos fell 11.4% year over year during the third quarter, the biggest decline in a year. That’s compared to a 3.5% decline in purchases of townhouses, a 2.1% decline for multifamily properties, and a 0.5% uptickfor single-family homes. \n\nThe downturn in investor activity in Florida partly explains why investor purchases of condos have fallen nationwide. Miami, for example, typically has the most condo sales of any major U.S. metro. But investor purchases of Miami condos have fallen 23.1% year over year, largely because [demand for condos](https://www.redfin.com/news/condo-supply-rises-florida-texas-2024/) in Florida has fallen so much. \n\nInvestors bought far more single-family homes in the third quarter than any other property type. Single-family homes made up 69.9% of investor purchases, up from 68% a year earlier. Condos made up 18.2% of their purchases in the third quarter, down from 20.1% a year earlier. Townhouses made up 6.7% and multi-family properties made up 5.2%, both equal to the shares a year earlier. \n\nIn terms of market share, investors bought 16% of U.S. condos that sold in the third quarter, the lowest share in three years but down just marginally from 16.8% a year earlier. Investors bought 31.1% of multi-family properties that sold in the third quarter, 15.4% of single-family homes, and 14.9% of townhouses, all roughly unchanged year over year. \n\n**Other Metro-Level Highlights**\n\n**Investor Market Share: Q3 2024**\n\n  * In Miami, investors bought 28.2% of all homes that sold in the third quarter, the biggest share of any metro in this analysis. \n  * Investors bought 7.8% of homes that sold in Providence, RI in the third quarter, the smallest share of the metros in this analysis. \n  * Investor market share increased most in Anaheim, CA, rising to 24.3% from 22.2%. \n  * Even though investors still have the highest market share in Miami, it has fallen the most from a year ago, dropping to 28.2% from 31.2%. \n\n\n\n**Investor Capital Gains: October 2024**\n\n  * In Detroit, the typical home sold by an investor went for 135% more than they bought it for, the biggest gain among the metros in this analysis. \n  * The smallest capital gains were in Phoenix (32%), Las Vegas (34%) and Sacramento, CA (39%). \n  * In Milwaukee, the typical home sold by an investor went for 97% more than they bought it for, up from a 31% gain a year earlier. That’s the biggest gain among the metros Redfin analyzed. \n  * In roughly half of the metros in this analysis, investors’ median capital gain declined year over year. In Washington, D.C., the typical home sold by an investor went for a 45% premium, _down_ from a 74% premium. \n\n\n\nRedfin’s report is based on its analysis of county-level home purchase records across 39 of the most populous U.S. metropolitan areas going back through 2000. Redfin defines an investor as any institution or business that purchases residential real estate, meaning the report covers both institutional and mom-and-pop investors. \n\nTo view the full report, including charts, metro-level data and additional methodology, please visit: <https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-stabilize-q3-2024/>\n\n**About Redfin**\n\nRedfin ([www.redfin.com](https://www.redfin.com/)) is a technology-powered real estate company.

That’s according to a new [report](https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-homebuying-demand-jumps) from Redfin ([redfin.com](http://redfin.com)), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. \n\nThe number of people contacting Redfin agents for help buying and/or selling their home is up by double digits from a year ago. Redfin’s Homebuyer Demand Index–a seasonally adjusted measure of those contacts–rose 17% year over year to its highest level since August 2023, continuing an increase that started immediately after the election. That 17% increase is the biggest since January 2022. It’s worth noting that Redfin is comparing to a period in 2023 when high mortgage rates were pushing down demand. Today’s weekly average mortgage rate is 6.78%, compared to 7.44% a year ago. Mortgage-purchase applications are up 2% week over week, and pending home sales rose 4.5% year over year during the four weeks ending November 17, in line with the increases seen over the last month and a half. \n\n“The burst of buyers and sellers jumping into the market is the result of pent-up demand from people who were waiting for the election to pass, and for the Fed to cut interest rates a second time,” said Redfin Economic Research Lead Chen Zhao. “Even though mortgage rates have been rising since both of those things happened, house hunters who had pressed pause are jumping back in. Now we’re keeping a close eye on whether this is a short post-election boom, or if it translates into a steady improvement in pending sales.” \n\nNew listings rose marginally (0.4%) year over year, and the total number of homes for sale is up 11.8%. \n\n“The market is moving surprisingly quickly right now, given that rates are fairly high and we’re well into fall, when buyers and sellers are typically winding down for the holidays,” said [Meme Loggins](https://www.redfin.com/real-estate-agents/meme-loggins), a Redfin [Premier](https://www.redfin.com/premier) agent in Portland, OR. “Some homebuyers are still having trouble getting over the psychological barrier of high mortgage rates, but plenty others are accepting that rates aren’t coming down anytime soon and taking out conventional or FHA loans. I’m advising buyers who can afford today’s high costs to move forward because prices are lower in this area than they were a year ago, and they’re likely to shoot back up soon as competition heats up. And sellers should consider listing now, because there are serious buyers out there–especially for desirable homes.” \n\n_For Redfin economists’ takes on the housing market, please visit Redfin’s “_[ _From Our Economists_](https://www.redfin.com/news/from-our-economists/) _” page._\n\n**Indicators of homebuying demand and activity**  \n---  \n**Value (if applicable)** |  **Recent change** |  **Year-over-year change** |  **Source**  \n**Daily average 30-year fixed mortgage rate** |  7.05% (Nov. 20)  |  Near highest level since July, but down from 7.13% 2 weeks earlier  |  Down from 7.37%  |  Mortgage News Daily   \n**Weekly average 30-year fixed mortgage rate** |  6.78% (week ending Nov. 14)  |  Near highest level since July  |  Down from 7.44%  |  Freddie Mac   \n**Mortgage-purchase applications (seasonally adjusted)** |  Up 2% from a week earlier (as of week ending Nov. 15)  |  Down 1%  |  Mortgage Bankers Association   \n**Redfin Homebuyer Demand Index (seasonally adjusted)** |  Highest level since August 2023  (as of week ending Nov. 17)  |  Up 17%  Biggest increase in nearly 3 years  |  Redfin Homebuyer Demand Index a measure of tours and other homebuying services from Redfin agents   \n**Touring activity** |  Down 3% from the start of the year (as of Nov. 16)  |  At this time last year, it was down 19% from the start of 2023  |  ShowingTime, a home touring technology company   \n**Google searches for “home for sale”** |  Up 15% from a month earlier (as of Nov. 18)  |  Unchanged  |  Google Trends   \n  \n**Key housing-market data**\n\n**U.S. highlights: Four weeks ending Nov. 17, 2024** _Redfin’s national metrics include data from 400+ U.S. metro areas and is based on homes listed and/or sold during the period.

Gross profit was $101.9 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Real estate services gross profit was $48.7 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, and real estate services gross margin was 28%, compared to 30% in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nNet loss was $33.8 million, compared to a net loss of $19.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss attributable to common stock was $34.1 million. Net loss per share attributable to common stock, diluted, was $0.28, compared to net loss per share, diluted, of $0.17 in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.9 million, down from an adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n“Redfin’s third-quarter results were within our guidance range, and we’re now forecasting fourth-quarter growth in market share and revenues,” said Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman. “Already, shifting our real estate agents to a commissions-based model has improved close rates, with industry-leading attach rates for mortgage and title services. And now, the growth in our digital businesses and our reductions in headquarters costs will let us fund more demand-generation. With plans to hire hundreds of agents between now and next spring, we’re emerging from a year of record low U.S. home sales ready to go on the attack.” \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights**\n\n  * Thirdquarter market share was 0.76% of U.S. existing home sales by units, compared to 0.78% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Average lead agents of 1,757, up 1 percent compared to the third quarter of 2023 and marking Redfin’s second straight quarter of sequential agent growth. \n  * Achieved a 27% mortgage attach rate in the third quarter of 2024, up from 22% in the third quarter of 2023.1\n  * Maintained momentum in loyalty sales, with 37% of sales coming from loyalty customers compared to 36% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Announced the nationwide expansion of our Redfin Next agent pay plan and transitioned all existing agents to the plan on October 27. To date, Redfin has hired more than 500 agents to join the brokerage under Next. \n  * Launched Redfin Teams nationwide, helping teams of up to five agents formally partner to expand their business and grow their career to a new level. More than 180 agents have joined the program since it launched in September, including over 50 who are new to the brokerage. \n  * Extended Redfin Redesign’s reach by partnering with five additional multiple listing services. The AI-powered home design tool is now available on more than 355,000 for-sale listings across the U.S. and to any U.S. homeowner who has claimed their home on Redfin. \n  * Expanded Redfin’s rental tools nationwide, which was announced on October 15. Property managers across the country can now use Redfin to list rental homes for free, connect with renters across Redfin’s family of sites, and manage the application and renter screening process. \n  * Supported agents and customers through the National Association of Realtors settlement changes by integrating a consumer-friendly fee agreement into our tour scheduling process and giving customers who commit to Redfin early a better deal through Sign & Save. \n\n(1)  |  Attach rate reflects total closed loans for Redfin buy-side customers divided by Redfin buy-side transactions with a mortgage (excluding cash transactions) for the period. We previously reported only the inclusive attach rate (includes cash transactions in the denominator), which was 21% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 18% in the third quarter of 2023.   \n---|---  \n  \n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Redfin's expectations as of November 7, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. \n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024 we expect: \n\n  * Total revenue between $237 million and $247 million, representing a year-over-year growth between 9% and 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Included within total revenue are real estate services revenue between $144 million and $150 million, rentals revenue of $51 million, mortgage revenue between $28 million and $32 million and other revenue between $13 million and $14 million. \n  * Total net loss is expected to be between $32 million and $25 million, compared to net loss of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This guidance includes approximately $22 million in total marketing expenses, $18 million of stock-based compensation, $9 million in depreciation and amortization, and $7 million in net interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1 million and $8 million. Furthermore, we expect to pay a final dividend of 20,427 shares of common stock to our preferred stockholder. \n\n\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nRedfin will webcast a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. The webcast will be open to the public at <http://investors.redfin.com>. The webcast will remain available on the investor relations website for at least three months following the conference call. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including our future operating results, as described under _Business Outlook_. We believe our expectations related to these forward-looking statements are reasonable, but actual results may turn out to be materially different. For factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, please see the risks and uncertainties identified under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our quarterly report for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, each of which are available on our Investor Relations website at <http://investors.redfin.com> and on the SEC website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov). All forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements that are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we also compute and present adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors because it enhances period-to-period comparability of our financial statements on a consistent basis and provides investors with useful insight into the underlying trends of the business. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute of, or superior to, our financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from adjusted EBITDA or similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Our adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below, along with a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss. \n\n**About Redfin**\n\nRedfin ([www.redfin.com](http://www.redfin.com)) is a technology-powered real estate company.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nRedfin Reports Third Quarter 2024\nFinancial Results\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ: RDFN) today announced\nresults for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024\nThird quarter revenue was $278.0 million, an increase of 3% compared to the third quarter of\n2023. Gross profit was $101.9 million, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Real estate\nservices gross profit was $48.7 million, a decrease of 10% year-over-year, and real estate\nservices gross margin was 28%, compared to 30% in the third quarter of 2023.\nNet loss was $33.8 million, compared to a net loss of $19.0 million in the third quarter of\n2023. Net loss attributable to common stock was $34.1 million. Net loss per share\nattributable to common stock, diluted, was $0.28, compared to net loss per share, diluted, of\n$0.17 in the third quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.9 million, down from an adjusted EBITDA of $7.7 million in the\nthird quarter of 2023.\n“Redfin’s third-quarter results were within our guidance range, and we’re now forecasting\nfourth-quarter growth in market share and revenues,” said Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman.\n“Already, shifting our real estate agents to a commissions-based model has improved close\nrates, with industry-leading attach rates for mortgage and title services. And now, the growth\nin our digital businesses and our reductions in headquarters costs will let us fund more\ndemand-generation. With plans to hire hundreds of agents between now and next spring,\nwe’re emerging from a year of record low U.S. home sales ready to go on the attack.”\nThird Quarter Highlights\nThird quarter market share was 0.76% of U.S. existing home sales by units, compared\nto 0.78% in the third quarter of 2023.\nAverage lead agents of 1,757, up 1 percent compared to the third quarter of 2023 and\nmarking Redfin’s second straight quarter of sequential agent growth.\nAchieved a 27% mortgage attach rate in the third quarter of 2024, up from 22% in the\nthird quarter of 2023.1\nMaintained momentum in loyalty sales, with 37% of sales coming from loyalty\ncustomers compared to 36% in the third quarter of 2023.\nAnnounced the nationwide expansion of our Redfin Next agent pay plan and\ntransitioned all existing agents to the plan on October 27. To date, Redfin has hired\nmore than 500 agents to join the brokerage under Next.\nLaunched Redfin Teams nationwide, helping teams of up to five agents formally\npartner to expand their business and grow their career to a new level. More than 180\nagents have joined the program since it launched in September, including over 50 who\nare new to the brokerage.\nExtended Redfin Redesign’s reach by partnering with five additional multiple listing\nservices. The AI-powered home design tool is now available on more than 355,000 for-\nsale listings across the U.S. and to any U.S. homeowner who has claimed their home\non Redfin.\nExpanded Redfin’s rental tools nationwide, which was announced on October 15.\nProperty managers across the country can now use Redfin to list rental homes for free,\nconnect with renters across Redfin’s family of sites, and manage the application and\nrenter screening process.\nSupported agents and customers through the National Association of Realtors\nsettlement changes by integrating a consumer-friendly fee agreement into our tour\nscheduling process and giving customers who commit to Redfin early a better deal\nthrough Sign & Save.\n(1) Attach rate reflects total closed loans for Redfin buy-side customers divided by Redfin buy-side transactions with a mortgage\n(excluding cash transactions) for the period. We previously reported only the inclusive attach rate (includes cash transactions in the\ndenominator), which was 21% in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 18% in the third quarter of 2023.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Redfin's expectations as of November 7,\n2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024 we expect:\nTotal revenue between $237 million and $247 million, representing a year-over-year\ngrowth between 9% and 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Included within\ntotal revenue are real estate services revenue between $144 million and $150 million,\nrentals revenue of $51 million, mortgage revenue between $28 million and $32 million\nand other revenue between $13 million and $14 million.\nTotal net loss is expected to be between $32 million and $25 million, compared to net\nloss of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. This guidance includes approximately\n$22 million in total marketing expenses, $18 million of stock-based compensation, $9\nmillion in depreciation and amortization, and $7 million in net interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1 million and $8 million. Furthermore, we\nexpect to pay a final dividend of 20,427 shares of common stock to our preferred\nstockholder.\nConference Call\nRedfin will webcast a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today.\nThe webcast will be open to the public at http://investors.redfin.com. The webcast will remain\navailable on the investor relations website for at least three months following the conference\ncall.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal\nsecurities laws, including our future operating results, as described under Business Outlook.\nWe believe our expectations related to these forward-looking statements are reasonable, but\nactual results may turn out to be materially different. For factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, please\nsee the risks and uncertainties identified under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our annual\nreport for the year ended December 31, 2023, as supplemented by our quarterly report for\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2024, each of which are available on our Investor Relations\nwebsite at http://investors.redfin.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. All forward-\nlooking statements reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press\nrelease. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect future\nevents or circumstances.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements that are prepared and presented in\naccordance with GAAP, we also compute and present adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-\nGAAP financial measure. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors because it\nenhances period-to-period comparability of our financial statements on a consistent basis\nand provides investors with useful insight into the underlying trends of the business. The\npresentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a\nsubstitute of, or superior to, our financial information prepared and presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from adjusted EBITDA or\nsimilar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for\ncomparison purposes. Our adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below, along with a reconciliation of adjusted\nEBITDA to net loss.\nAbout Redfin\nRedfin (www.redfin.com) is a technology-powered real estate company.
