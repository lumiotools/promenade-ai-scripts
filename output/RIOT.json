During the month of October, our deployed hash rate increased to 29.4 EH/s, driven by new deployments of latest generation MicroBT miners at the Corsicana Facility. We are pleased with the positive operational momentum underway and look forward to continuing this progress.”\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Corsicana-11-4-24-1.png)\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility, Building B1](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Corsicana-11-4-24-2.png)\n\n**Corsicana Updates**\n\nRiot is nearing completion of Phase 1 (400 MW) of the Company’s Corsicana Facility, which, once fully developed, is expected to total 1 gigawatt (1,000 MW) in developed mining capacity.\n\nRiot has also announced commencement of the development of Phase 2 (600 MW) of the Company’s Corsicana Facility.

The accompanying presentation materials are available on Riot’s [website](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4290546-1&h=1217564435&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3D1jFoVMrNXFjtCBS7tAStQed7KKY7CPE7qCqKLUxAq4Dw6QOoZIoq3Hwy92IyMtwo48VT5iBjg9v2TvneVT9x2KzXjyW0OVyxGAh1C6nU9hY%3D&a=website).\n\n“I’m pleased to announce Riot’s results for the third quarter 2024, the first full quarter past the Bitcoin ‘halving’ event, during which Riot continued to achieve significant growth while maintaining industry-leading low power costs,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “Riot recorded $84.8 million in revenue this quarter, representing a 65% increase over the same quarter in 2023, driven by a 159% year-over-year increase in deployed hash rate to 28 EH/s at the end of the quarter. This significant increase in deployed hash rate allowed us to produce 1,104 Bitcoin this quarter, in-line with our Bitcoin production in the third quarter of 2023, despite the ‘halving’.\n\n“During the quarter, Riot once again demonstrated the benefits of our unique power strategy, achieving an industry-leading average all-in cost of power of 3.1 cents/kWh. Riot’s flexibility to utilize power at our Corsicana Facility when the market price for power in ERCOT is low, coupled with the long-term fixed price PPA at our Rockdale Facility, gives Riot tremendous optionality to optimize our power costs and represents a key competitive advantage for us.\n\n“Riot also ended the quarter having maintained our robust balance sheet strength, with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, restricted cash, marketable equity securities, and 10,427 Bitcoin held. Looking forward, I am incredibly excited about our future path, as our teams continue working to develop and deploy even more power capacity and hash rate across Texas and Kentucky, towards Riot’s next goal of achieving 100 EH/s in self-mining capacity.”\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Corsicana-Facility.png)\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\nKey financial and operational highlights for the third quarter include:\n\n  * Total revenue of $84.8 million, as compared to $51.9 million for the same three-month period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $36.3 million increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue.\n  * Produced 1,104 Bitcoin during the quarter, in-line with the 1,106 Bitcoin mined during the same three-month period in 2023 and despite the block subsidy ‘halving’ event which occurred in April 2024 and an increase in network difficulty.\n  * The average cost to mine Bitcoin, excluding depreciation, was $35,376 in the quarter, as compared to negative ($22,741) per Bitcoin for the same three-month period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in power credits received in Q3 2024 relative to power credits received in Q3 2023, the block subsidy ‘halving’ event, which occurred in April 2024, and a 59% increase in the average global network hash rate as compared to the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Generated $12.4 million in power credits during the quarter, as compared to $49.6 million in power credits generated for the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Bitcoin Mining revenue of $67.5 million for the quarter, as compared to $31.2 million for the same three-month period in 2023, primarily driven by higher average Bitcoin prices and an increase in operational hash rate, partially offset by an increase in network difficulty and the block subsidy ‘halving’ event.\n  * Engineering revenue of $12.6 million for the quarter, as compared to $15.5 million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Maintained industry-leading financial position, with $590.6 million in working capital, including $355.7 million in cash on hand and $190.1 million in marketable equity securities.\n  * Held 10,427 in unencumbered Bitcoin (equating to approximately $660.3 million based on a market price for one Bitcoin on September 30, 2024, of $63,330), all of which were produced by the Company’s self-mining operations, as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $84.8 million, and consisted of $67.5 million in Bitcoin Mining revenue and $12.6 million in Engineering revenue. Other revenue, attributable to third-party hosting, totaled $4.8 million.\n\nBitcoin Mining gross profit, excluding depreciation, for the quarter was $28.4 million (42% Bitcoin Mining margin), as compared to $56.4 million (181% Bitcoin Mining margin) for the same three-month period in 2023. Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue consists primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, and insurance, but excluding depreciation and amortization.\n\nEngineering gross loss, excluding depreciation, for the quarter was $(0.9) million, as compared to Engineering gross profit, excluding depreciation, of $2.3 million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n\nPower curtailment credits received totaled approximately $12.4 million for the quarter, as compared to $49.6 million during the same three-month period in 2023.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter totaled $66.9 million, an increase of $37.9 million relative to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by increases in stock-based compensation expenses of $13.5 million primarily related to new grants under our long-term incentive program, a $4.2 million increase in advisory expenses related to ongoing M&A activity and increased legal costs of $3.0 million primarily related to ongoing litigation.\n\nNet loss for the quarter was $(154.4) million, or $(0.54) per share, compared to a net loss of $(80.0) million, or $(0.44) per share, for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the quarter included an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $38.0 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $30.6 million, and depreciation and amortization of $60.0 million.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $(3.6) million, as compared to $(3.1) million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n\n**Hash Rate Growth**\n\nRiot currently anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 34.9 EH/s by the end of 2024, a decrease from prior guidance of 36.3 EH/s by the end of the year, primarily driven by slower than planned expansion in the recently acquired Kentucky facilities, which had previously been anticipated to come online this year and which are now expected to come online in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Riot now anticipates ending 2025 at 46.7 EH/s, lower than prior guidance of 56.6 EH/s. This reduction is driven by previous 2025 expansion plans in Kentucky now being pushed out into 2026, and longer than anticipated lead times for the next substation at the Corsicana Facility, which will result in two new buildings coming online in 2025 versus prior expectations for three buildings.\n\nRiot now expects to complete the full development of the Corsicana Facility in 2026 and, alongside expansion plans in the Kentucky Facilities, to achieve a hash rate capacity of 65.7 EH/s by the end of 2026.\n\n![Hash Rate Growth](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hashrate-103024.png)\n\n**ATM Offerings**\n\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into the August 2024 ATM Offering, under which it could offer and sell up to $750.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, replacing the Offering entered into in February 2024.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $730.8 million ($746.4 million of gross proceeds, net of $15.6 million in commissions and expenses) from the sale of 70,113,816 shares of its common stock at a weighted average fair value of $10.65 per share under its 2024 ATM Offerings and previous 2023 ATM Offering.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, and through October 28, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $62.1 million from the sale of 8,106,500 shares of its common stock at a weighted average fair value of $7.81 per share under its August 2024 ATM Offering.\n\nAs of October 30, 2024, the Company had 332,325,535 shares of its common stock outstanding.\n\n**About Riot Platforms, Inc.**\n\nRiot’s (NASDAQ: RIOT) vision is to be the world’s leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform.\n\nOur mission is to positively impact the sectors, networks and communities that we touch.

Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure defined as EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations, which management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company’s core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. We exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of Bitcoin from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric for share-based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, net income, the most comparable measure under GAAP for Adjusted EBITDA. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss) |  $ |  (154,362) |  $ |  (80,040) |  $ |  (27,034) |  $ |  (88,914)  \nInterest (income) expense |  (5,175) |  (2,318) |  (21,132) |  (3,331)  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) |  32 |  (157) |  65 |  (5,014)  \nDepreciation and amortization |  60,000 |  64,569 |  129,669 |  190,071  \nEBITDA |  (99,505) |  (17,946) |  81,568 |  92,812  \nAdjustments:  \nStock-based compensation expense |  30,567 |  13,519 |  94,702 |  14,652  \nAcquisition-related costs |  3,079 |  – |  3,079 |  –  \nChange in fair value of derivative asset |  24,318 |  (3,943) |  (23,398) |  (11,274)  \nUnrealized loss (gain) on marketable equity securities |  38,082 |  – |  13,620 |  –  \nLoss (gain) on sale/exchange of equipment |  – |  5,306 |  68 |  5,336  \nCasualty-related charges (recoveries), net |  – |  – |  (2,487) |  1,526  \nOther (income) expense |  (90) |  (31) |  (131) |  (96)  \nLicense fees |  (24) |  (24) |  (48) |  (48)  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  (3,573) |  $ |  (3,119) |  $ |  166,973 |  $ |  102,908  \n  \nThe Company defines Cost to Mine as the cost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation, as calculated in the table below.\n\nThree Months Ended |  Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, |  September 30,  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nCost of power for self-mining operations |  $ 41,864 |  $ 22,460 |  $ 96,326 |  $ 65,513  \nOther direct cost of revenue for self-mining operations(1)(2), excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  9,608 |  1,989 |  26,970 |  4,482  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  51,472 |  24,449 |  123,296 |  69,995  \nLess: power curtailment credits(3) |  (12,417) |  (49,601) |  (31,445) |  (66,146)  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, net of power curtailment credits, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  39,055 |  (25,152) |  91,851 |  3,849  \nBitcoin miner depreciation |  44,303 |  55,549 |  93,120 |  164,457  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, net of power curtailment credits, including Bitcoin miner depreciation |  $ 83,358 |  $ 30,397 |  $ 184,971 |  $ 168,306  \nQuantity of Bitcoin mined |  1,104 |  1,106 |  3,312 |  4,996  \nProduction value of one Bitcoin mined(4) |  $ 61,133 |  $ 28,228 |  $ 58,771 |  $ 25,818  \n**Cost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation** |  **$ 35,376** |  **$ (22,741)** |  **$ 27,733** |  **$ 770**  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation, as a % of production value of one Bitcoin mined |  57.9 % |  -80.6 % |  47.2 % |  3.0 %  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, including Bitcoin miner depreciation |  $ 75,506 |  $ 27,484 |  $ 55,849 |  $ 33,688  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, including Bitcoin miner depreciation, as a % of production value of one Bitcoin mined |  123.5 % |  97.4 % |  95.0 % |  130.5 %  \n  \n_(1) Other direct cost of revenue includes compensation, insurance, repairs, and ground lease rent and related property tax_  \n---  \n_(2) Costs to finance the purchase of miners were zero in all periods presented as the miners were paid for with cash from the Company’s cash balance.

Following the completion of our third 100 MW building, Building B1, at our Corsicana Facility during the month, we achieved a total deployed hash rate capacity of 28.2 EH/s. Building on this momentum, our teams continue to make rapid progress on the construction and deployment of the fourth 100 MW building at our Corsicana Facility, Building B2, which will deliver further increases in hash rate growth and operational efficiency.”\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DJI_0997-Enhanced-NR-scaled.jpg)\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility Phase 1](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DJI_0003-Enhanced-NR-scaled.jpg)\n\n**Riot’s Power Strategy Overview**\n\nRiot’s power strategy is based on being a flexible consumer of power. The Company typically consumes power when it is low-cost and abundant, as opposed to residential consumers, who typically increase power usage during peak periods of demand. When demand increases and/or supply decreases, causing prices to rise, the Company can either power down to reduce power costs, or bid competitively to provide the grid operator with visibility into, and control over, Riot’s power utilization. This control gives the grid operator the ability to either absorb excess power when supply is high or to curtail Riot’s operations in order to reduce demand when beneficial to the grid, and ultimately, to all consumers.\n\nDuring September, Riot continued its participation in ERCOT’s Four Coincident Peak Program (“4CP”). The 4CP program is an opportunity for users of power to curtail usage during periods of highest demand on the grid in each of the four summer months of the year. Riot curtailed operations in September during peak periods of demand. These periods of curtailment occur whenever total demand on the grid potentially reaches its peak point for each month, and does not depend on the current price for power, which fluctuates due to a variety of factors and may be lower or higher than anticipated. As part of Riot’s participation in this voluntary program, the Company can achieve substantial savings on future costs, and participation is a key part of the Company’s partnership-driven approach with the grid and all consumers of power in ERCOT.\n\n**Corsicana Updates**\n\nRiot is currently developing Phase 1 (400 MW) of the Company’s Corsicana Facility, which, once fully developed, is expected to total 1 gigawatt (1,000 MW) in developed mining capacity.\n\nRiot completed the development of the third 100 MW building, Building B1, in September, bringing power capacity at the Corsicana Facility to 300 MW. Development continues on the final 100 MW building of Phase 1, Building B2, which is expected to be completed and fully operational in November.\n\nDuring the first two days of October, the Corsicana Facility was powered down for planned maintenance on its substation. This maintenance was completed on October 2nd, and the facility has now resumed normal operations.\n\n**Estimated Hash Rate Growth**\n\n![Estimated Hash Rate Growth](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Hash-rate-Graph-10-3-24.png)\n\n**Investor Events**\n\n  * Bitcoin Amsterdam held in Amsterdam on October 9-10th\n  * AIM Summit in Dubai on October 21-22nd\n\n\n\n**Human Resources Update**\n\nRiot is currently recruiting for positions across the Company.

The accompanying presentation materials are available on Riot’s [website](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4290546-1&h=1217564435&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.globenewswire.com%2FTracker%3Fdata%3D1jFoVMrNXFjtCBS7tAStQed7KKY7CPE7qCqKLUxAq4Dw6QOoZIoq3Hwy92IyMtwo48VT5iBjg9v2TvneVT9x2KzXjyW0OVyxGAh1C6nU9hY%3D&a=website).\n\n“I’m pleased to announce Riot’s results for the third quarter 2024, the first full quarter past the Bitcoin ‘halving’ event, during which Riot continued to achieve significant growth while maintaining industry-leading low power costs,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “Riot recorded $84.8 million in revenue this quarter, representing a 65% increase over the same quarter in 2023, driven by a 159% year-over-year increase in deployed hash rate to 28 EH/s at the end of the quarter. This significant increase in deployed hash rate allowed us to produce 1,104 Bitcoin this quarter, in-line with our Bitcoin production in the third quarter of 2023, despite the ‘halving’.\n\n“During the quarter, Riot once again demonstrated the benefits of our unique power strategy, achieving an industry-leading average all-in cost of power of 3.1 cents/kWh. Riot’s flexibility to utilize power at our Corsicana Facility when the market price for power in ERCOT is low, coupled with the long-term fixed price PPA at our Rockdale Facility, gives Riot tremendous optionality to optimize our power costs and represents a key competitive advantage for us.\n\n“Riot also ended the quarter having maintained our robust balance sheet strength, with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, restricted cash, marketable equity securities, and 10,427 Bitcoin held. Looking forward, I am incredibly excited about our future path, as our teams continue working to develop and deploy even more power capacity and hash rate across Texas and Kentucky, towards Riot’s next goal of achieving 100 EH/s in self-mining capacity.”\n\n![Riot's Corsicana Facility](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Corsicana-Facility.png)\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights**\n\nKey financial and operational highlights for the third quarter include:\n\n  * Total revenue of $84.8 million, as compared to $51.9 million for the same three-month period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a $36.3 million increase in Bitcoin Mining revenue.\n  * Produced 1,104 Bitcoin during the quarter, in-line with the 1,106 Bitcoin mined during the same three-month period in 2023 and despite the block subsidy ‘halving’ event which occurred in April 2024 and an increase in network difficulty.\n  * The average cost to mine Bitcoin, excluding depreciation, was $35,376 in the quarter, as compared to negative ($22,741) per Bitcoin for the same three-month period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 75% decrease in power credits received in Q3 2024 relative to power credits received in Q3 2023, the block subsidy ‘halving’ event, which occurred in April 2024, and a 59% increase in the average global network hash rate as compared to the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Generated $12.4 million in power credits during the quarter, as compared to $49.6 million in power credits generated for the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Bitcoin Mining revenue of $67.5 million for the quarter, as compared to $31.2 million for the same three-month period in 2023, primarily driven by higher average Bitcoin prices and an increase in operational hash rate, partially offset by an increase in network difficulty and the block subsidy ‘halving’ event.\n  * Engineering revenue of $12.6 million for the quarter, as compared to $15.5 million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n  * Maintained industry-leading financial position, with $590.6 million in working capital, including $355.7 million in cash on hand and $190.1 million in marketable equity securities.\n  * Held 10,427 in unencumbered Bitcoin (equating to approximately $660.3 million based on a market price for one Bitcoin on September 30, 2024, of $63,330), all of which were produced by the Company’s self-mining operations, as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 was $84.8 million, and consisted of $67.5 million in Bitcoin Mining revenue and $12.6 million in Engineering revenue. Other revenue, attributable to third-party hosting, totaled $4.8 million.\n\nBitcoin Mining gross profit, excluding depreciation, for the quarter was $28.4 million (42% Bitcoin Mining margin), as compared to $56.4 million (181% Bitcoin Mining margin) for the same three-month period in 2023. Bitcoin Mining cost of revenue consists primarily of direct production costs of mining operations, including electricity, labor, and insurance, but excluding depreciation and amortization.\n\nEngineering gross loss, excluding depreciation, for the quarter was $(0.9) million, as compared to Engineering gross profit, excluding depreciation, of $2.3 million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n\nPower curtailment credits received totaled approximately $12.4 million for the quarter, as compared to $49.6 million during the same three-month period in 2023.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter totaled $66.9 million, an increase of $37.9 million relative to the same period in 2023. This increase was driven by increases in stock-based compensation expenses of $13.5 million primarily related to new grants under our long-term incentive program, a $4.2 million increase in advisory expenses related to ongoing M&A activity and increased legal costs of $3.0 million primarily related to ongoing litigation.\n\nNet loss for the quarter was $(154.4) million, or $(0.54) per share, compared to a net loss of $(80.0) million, or $(0.44) per share, for the same period in 2023. The net loss for the quarter included an unrealized loss on marketable equity securities of $38.0 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $30.6 million, and depreciation and amortization of $60.0 million.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $(3.6) million, as compared to $(3.1) million for the same three-month period in 2023.\n\n**Hash Rate Growth**\n\nRiot currently anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 34.9 EH/s by the end of 2024, a decrease from prior guidance of 36.3 EH/s by the end of the year, primarily driven by slower than planned expansion in the recently acquired Kentucky facilities, which had previously been anticipated to come online this year and which are now expected to come online in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Riot now anticipates ending 2025 at 46.7 EH/s, lower than prior guidance of 56.6 EH/s. This reduction is driven by previous 2025 expansion plans in Kentucky now being pushed out into 2026, and longer than anticipated lead times for the next substation at the Corsicana Facility, which will result in two new buildings coming online in 2025 versus prior expectations for three buildings.\n\nRiot now expects to complete the full development of the Corsicana Facility in 2026 and, alongside expansion plans in the Kentucky Facilities, to achieve a hash rate capacity of 65.7 EH/s by the end of 2026.\n\n![Hash Rate Growth](https://www.riotplatforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hashrate-103024.png)\n\n**ATM Offerings**\n\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into the August 2024 ATM Offering, under which it could offer and sell up to $750.0 million in shares of the Company’s common stock, replacing the Offering entered into in February 2024.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $730.8 million ($746.4 million of gross proceeds, net of $15.6 million in commissions and expenses) from the sale of 70,113,816 shares of its common stock at a weighted average fair value of $10.65 per share under its 2024 ATM Offerings and previous 2023 ATM Offering.\n\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, and through October 28, 2024, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $62.1 million from the sale of 8,106,500 shares of its common stock at a weighted average fair value of $7.81 per share under its August 2024 ATM Offering.\n\nAs of October 30, 2024, the Company had 332,325,535 shares of its common stock outstanding.\n\n**About Riot Platforms, Inc.**\n\nRiot’s (NASDAQ: RIOT) vision is to be the world’s leading Bitcoin-driven infrastructure platform.\n\nOur mission is to positively impact the sectors, networks and communities that we touch.

Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure defined as EBITDA, adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations, which management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the Company’s core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items. We exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of Bitcoin from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented.\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiency from period-to-period by making such adjustments. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric for share-based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, net income, the most comparable measure under GAAP for Adjusted EBITDA. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.\n\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure:\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30,** |  **September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (loss) |  $ |  (154,362) |  $ |  (80,040) |  $ |  (27,034) |  $ |  (88,914)  \nInterest (income) expense |  (5,175) |  (2,318) |  (21,132) |  (3,331)  \nIncome tax expense (benefit) |  32 |  (157) |  65 |  (5,014)  \nDepreciation and amortization |  60,000 |  64,569 |  129,669 |  190,071  \nEBITDA |  (99,505) |  (17,946) |  81,568 |  92,812  \nAdjustments:  \nStock-based compensation expense |  30,567 |  13,519 |  94,702 |  14,652  \nAcquisition-related costs |  3,079 |  – |  3,079 |  –  \nChange in fair value of derivative asset |  24,318 |  (3,943) |  (23,398) |  (11,274)  \nUnrealized loss (gain) on marketable equity securities |  38,082 |  – |  13,620 |  –  \nLoss (gain) on sale/exchange of equipment |  – |  5,306 |  68 |  5,336  \nCasualty-related charges (recoveries), net |  – |  – |  (2,487) |  1,526  \nOther (income) expense |  (90) |  (31) |  (131) |  (96)  \nLicense fees |  (24) |  (24) |  (48) |  (48)  \nAdjusted EBITDA |  $ |  (3,573) |  $ |  (3,119) |  $ |  166,973 |  $ |  102,908  \n  \nThe Company defines Cost to Mine as the cost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation, as calculated in the table below.\n\nThree Months Ended |  Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, |  September 30,  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nCost of power for self-mining operations |  $ 41,864 |  $ 22,460 |  $ 96,326 |  $ 65,513  \nOther direct cost of revenue for self-mining operations(1)(2), excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  9,608 |  1,989 |  26,970 |  4,482  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  51,472 |  24,449 |  123,296 |  69,995  \nLess: power curtailment credits(3) |  (12,417) |  (49,601) |  (31,445) |  (66,146)  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, net of power curtailment credits, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation |  39,055 |  (25,152) |  91,851 |  3,849  \nBitcoin miner depreciation |  44,303 |  55,549 |  93,120 |  164,457  \nCost of revenue for self-mining operations, net of power curtailment credits, including Bitcoin miner depreciation |  $ 83,358 |  $ 30,397 |  $ 184,971 |  $ 168,306  \nQuantity of Bitcoin mined |  1,104 |  1,106 |  3,312 |  4,996  \nProduction value of one Bitcoin mined(4) |  $ 61,133 |  $ 28,228 |  $ 58,771 |  $ 25,818  \n**Cost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation** |  **$ 35,376** |  **$ (22,741)** |  **$ 27,733** |  **$ 770**  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, excluding Bitcoin miner depreciation, as a % of production value of one Bitcoin mined |  57.9 % |  -80.6 % |  47.2 % |  3.0 %  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, including Bitcoin miner depreciation |  $ 75,506 |  $ 27,484 |  $ 55,849 |  $ 33,688  \nCost to mine one Bitcoin, including Bitcoin miner depreciation, as a % of production value of one Bitcoin mined |  123.5 % |  97.4 % |  95.0 % |  130.5 %  \n  \n_(1) Other direct cost of revenue includes compensation, insurance, repairs, and ground lease rent and related property tax_  \n---  \n_(2) Costs to finance the purchase of miners were zero in all periods presented as the miners were paid for with cash from the Company’s cash balance.

Our fixed-price power purchase contracts enable us to strategically curtail our mining operations and participate in these programs, which significantly lower our cost to mine Bitcoin. These credits are recognized in Power curtailment credits on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, outside of cost of revenue, but significantly reduce our overall cost to mine Bitcoin. _  \n_(4) Computed as revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined divided by the quantity of Bitcoin mined during the same period_  \n  \nThe Company defines Fully Costed Gross Profit as Revenue less Cost of revenue less Depreciation & Amortization expense as calculated below:\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, |  Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n_**Riot Platforms, Inc.:**_ |  2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nRevenue |  $ 84,786 |  $ 51,891 |  $ 234,100 |  $ 201,866  \n_less_ Bitcoin Mining Cost of revenue* |  (51,472) |  (24,449) |  (123,296) |  (69,995)  \n_less_ Engineering Cost of revenue* |  (13,517) |  (13,194) |  (27,796) |  (46,939)  \n_less_ Other Cost of revenue* |  (7,948) |  (26,135) |  (22,588) |  (73,929)  \n_less_ Depreciation and amortization expense |  (60,000) |  (64,569) |  (129,669) |  (190,071)  \n**Fully Costed Gross Profit** |  **$ (48,151)** |  **$ (76,456)** |  **$ (69,249)** |  **$ (179,068)**  \n_**Bitcoin Mining:**_  \nBitcoin Mining Revenue |  $ 67,491 |  $ 31,222 |  $ 194,651 |  $ 128,987  \n_less_ Bitcoin Mining Cost of revenue* |  (51,472) |  (24,449) |  (123,296) |  (69,995)  \n_less_ Depreciation and amortization expense of Bitcoin miners |  (44,303) |  (55,549) |  (93,120) |  (164,457)  \n**Fully Costed Gross Profit – Bitcoin Mining** |  **$ (28,284)** |  **$ (48,776)** |  **$ (21,765)** |  **$ (105,465)**  \n_**Engineering:**_  \nEngineering Revenue |  $ 12,638 |  $ 15,536 |  $ 26,940 |  $ 50,995  \n_less_ Engineering Cost of revenue* |  (13,517) |  (13,194) |  (27,796) |  (46,939)  \n_less_ Depreciation and amortization expense |  (399) |  (583) |  (1,240) |  (1,455)  \n**Fully Costed Gross Profit – Engineering** |  **$ (1,278)** |  **$ 1,759** |  **$ (2,096)** |  **$ 2,601**  \n_*excludes depreciation and amortization, which is presented separately_  \n  \nThe Company defines Gross Profit as Fully Costed Gross Profit (as defined above) plus Power Curtailment Credits plus Depreciation & Amortization expense.\n\nThree Months Ended |  Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, |  September 30,  \n2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \n_**Riot Platforms, Inc.:**_  \nFully Costed Gross Profit |  $ (48,151) |  $ (76,456) |  $ (69,249) |  $ (179,068)  \n_plus_ Power Curtailment Credits |  12,417 |  49,601 |  31,445 |  66,146  \n_plus_ Depreciation and amortization |  60,000 |  64,569 |  129,669 |  190,071  \n**Gross Profit** |  **$ 24,266** |  **$ 37,714** |  **$ 91,865** |  **$ 77,149**  \n_**Bitcoin Mining:**_  \nFully Costed Gross Profit |  $ (28,284) |  $ (48,776) |  $ (21,765) |  $ (105,465)  \n_plus_ Power Curtailment Credits |  12,417 |  49,601 |  31,445 |  66,146  \nplus Depreciation and amortization expense of Bitcoin miners |  44,303 |  55,549 |  93,120 |  164,457  \n**Gross Profit – Bitcoin Mining** |  **$ 28,436** |  **$ 56,374** |  **$ 102,800** |  **$ 125,138**  \n_**Engineering:**_  \nFully Costed Gross Profit |  $ (1,278) |  $ 1,759 |  $ (2,096) |  $ 2,601  \n_plus_ Depreciation and amortization |  399 |  583 |  1,240 |  1,455  \n**Gross Profit – Engineering** |  **$ (879)** |  **$ 2,342** |  **$ (856)** |  **$ 4,056**  \n  \nThe Company defines Gross Margin as Gross Profit (as defined above) divided by Revenue.\n\nThree Months Ended |  Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \nSeptember 30, |  September 30,  \n_**Riot Platforms, Inc.:**_ |  2024 |  2023 |  2024 |  2023  \nGross Profit |  $ 24,266 |  $ 37,714 |  $ 91,865 |  $ 77,149  \n_divided by_ Total Revenue |  $ 84,786 |  $ 51,891 |  $ 234,100 |  $ 201,866  \n**Gross Margin** |  **29 %** |  **73 %** |  **39 %** |  **38 %**  \n_**Bitcoin Mining:**_  \nGross Profit – Bitcoin Mining |  $ 28,436 |  $ 56,374 |  $ 102,800 |  $ 125,138  \n_divided by_ Bitcoin Mining Revenue |  $ 67,491 |  $ 31,222 |  $ 194,651 |  $ 128,987  \n**Gross Margin – Bitcoin Mining** |  **42 %** |  **181 %** |  **53 %** |  **97 %**  \n_**Engineering:**_  \nGross Profit – Engineering |  $ (879) |  $ 2,342 |  $ (856) |  $ 4,056  \n_divided by_ Engineering Revenue |  $ 12,638 |  $ 15,536 |  $ 26,940 |  $ 50,995  \n**Gross Margin – Engineering** |  **-7 %** |  **15 %** |  **-3 %** |  **8 %**  \n  \n[![Riot Logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Riot Platforms, Inc.\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2453283/RIot_Logo___Blue_Logov1.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2453283/RIot_Logo___Blue_Logov1.html)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=LA43831&sd=2024-10-30) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights-302291931.html>\n\nSOURCE Riot Platforms, Inc.\n\n![]()\n"
