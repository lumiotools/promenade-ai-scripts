The dividend reduction will result in $127 million of annual savings. \n\nSVC also today announced that it has plans to sell 114 focused service hotels managed by Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, or collectively with its parent and subsidiaries, Sonesta, with an aggregate of 14,925 keys and an aggregate net carrying value of $850.0 million. SVC expects to sell these hotels in 2025 and use the net sales proceeds to repay debt. Additionally, SVC expects the sales of these hotels will result in savings of approximately $725 million in capital expenditures, which was forecasted to be spent on these hotels over a six-year period. \n\nSVC currently owns 187 hotels that are managed by Sonesta under five brands, including 14 hotels that SVC is currently in the process of selling and the 114 being announced for sale today. Upon completion of the disposition plan in 2025, SVC expects that Sonesta will continue to manage 39 full service hotels, 14 extended stay hotels and 6 select service hotels owned by SVC. SVC will continue to own 34% of Sonesta. \n\nTodd Hargreaves, President and Chief Investment Officer of SVC, made the following statement: \n\n“Given the slow recovery of our hotel portfolio in combination with our hotel capital improvement and renovation program and our deteriorating leverage metrics, we believe it is prudent to reduce the distribution to increase SVC’s liquidity and enhance our financial flexibility. The reduction in the distribution from the previous level will preserve approximately $127 million of SVC’s liquidity annually. We are also planning to sell 114 hotels to generate additional liquidity and concentrate the Sonesta portfolio on full service hotels and certain higher performing focused service hotels. We expect these sales will also result in reduced capital expenditure and leverage, improve portfolio performance and better position SVC’s hotel portfolio for the long term.” \n\nThe hotels Sonesta will continue to manage are: \n\n_Service Level_ |  _Number of Hotels_ |  _Number of Keys_ |  _Number of States 1 _ |  _Net Carrying Value (in millions)_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Full Service** |  39  |  12,868  |  21  |  $2,257.3   \n**Extended Stay** |  14  |  2,102  |  7  |  $157.7   \n**Select Service** |  6  |  873  |  3  |  $47.0   \n_Total_ |  _59_ |  _15,843_ |  _25_ |  _$_ 2,462.0   \n_ 1  Includes two hotels in Toronto, Ontario, one hotel in Puerto Rico and one hotel in Washington, D.C. _  \n  \nThe hotels being sold are: \n\n_Brand_ |  _Number of Hotels_ |  _Number of Keys_ |  _Number of States_ |  _Net Carrying Value (in millions)_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n[ **Sonesta Select** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonesta.com%2Fsonesta-select&esheet=54136674&newsitemid=20241015799982&lan=en-US&anchor=Sonesta+Select&index=2&md5=3eda82cef0029f6ab9953dc85a6da326) |  31  |  4,564  |  14  |  $241.7   \n[ **Sonesta ES Suites** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonesta.com%2Fsonesta-es-suites&esheet=54136674&newsitemid=20241015799982&lan=en-US&anchor=Sonesta+ES+Suites&index=3&md5=468d169f37aaff1238550f9c7f942710) |  44  |  5,611  |  22  |  $427.4   \n[ **Sonesta Simply Suites** ](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonesta.com%2Fsonesta-simply-suites&esheet=54136674&newsitemid=20241015799982&lan=en-US&anchor=Sonesta+Simply+Suites&index=4&md5=375a697385d71670055b9b2955e0466a) |  39  |  4,750  |  23  |  $180.9   \n_Total_ |  _114_ |  _14,925_ |  _28_ |  _$850.0_  \n  \nThe cash distribution will be paid to SVC’s common shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 28, 2024, and distributed on or about November 14, 2024.

These forward-looking statements are based upon SVC’s present intent, beliefs and expectations, but these statements and the implications of these statements are not guaranteed to occur and may not occur for various reasons, some of which are beyond SVC’s control. For example: \n\n  * In this press release, SVC states that it is reducing its regular quarterly distribution to increase its liquidity and enhance financial flexibility. However, SVC’s Board of Trustees considers many factors when setting or resetting SVC’s distribution rate, including SVC’s historical and projected income, normalized funds from operations, cash available for distribution, the then current and expected needs and availability of cash to pay SVC’s obligations and fund its investments, distributions which may be required to be paid to maintain SVC’s qualification for taxation as a REIT and other factors deemed relevant by SVC’s Board of Trustees. Accordingly, future distributions to SVC’s shareholders may be increased or decreased and SVC cannot be sure as to the rate at which future distributions will be paid. \n  * In this press release, SVC states that it plans to sell 114 Sonesta managed hotels in 2025 in order to generate liquidity, concentrate the Sonesta portfolio on full service hotels and certain higher performing focused service hotels, reduce capital expenditure and leverage, improve portfolio performance and better position SVC’s hotel portfolio for the long term. SVC also states that it plans to use the net sales proceeds of these sale transactions for the repayment of debt. However, SVC may not succeed in selling properties and any sales may be delayed or may not occur or, if sales do occur, the proceeds from the sales of such properties may not be sufficient to allow SVC to reduce its leverage. \n\n\n\nYou should not place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements. \n\nExcept as required by law, SVC does not intend to update or change any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\nA Maryland Real Estate Investment Trust with transferable shares of beneficial interest listed on the Nasdaq. \n\nNo shareholder, Trustee or officer is personally liable for any act or obligation of the Trust. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241015799982r1&sid=q4-prod&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nKevin Barry, Senior Director, Investor Relations (617) 796-8232 \n\nSource: Service Properties Trust\n\n[ ![](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres@thumbnail.png) ](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres.jpg)\n\n2400 x 720 jpg 164 KB\n\nDownload: \n\n[ Download original jpg 164 KB 2400 x 720 ](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres.jpg)\n\n[ Download thumbnail png 6 KB 200 x 60 ](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres@thumbnail.png)\n\n[ Download lowres png 16 KB 480 x 144 ](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres@lowres.png)\n\n[ Download square png 9 KB 250 x 250 ](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_multimedia/2024/10/1008953838/servicepropertiestrust-logo-rgb-highres@square.png)\n\n[< View all News Releases](/news/default.aspx)\n\n  * [Terms & Conditions](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_downloads/Footer/2022/12/SVC_Web-Site-Terms-of-Use_081420-updated-link-2022.pdf) |\n  * [Privacy Policy](//s2.q4cdn.com/208827006/files/doc_downloads/Footer/2022/RMR-Privacy-Policy-\\(Final-12.20.22\\).pdf)\n\n\n\n[ U.S. Green Building Council](http://www.usgbc.org/) [ Energy Star](https://www.energystar.gov/)\n\nCopyright © 2024 Service Properties Trust \n\n## Cautionary Language \n\nThe information appearing on SVC’s website includes statements which constitute forward looking statements.

As of September30, 2024, SVC owned 214 hotels. SVC's condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) include hotel operating revenues and\nexpenses of its managed hotels.\n2. When managers of SVC's hotels are required to fund the shortfalls of owner's priority return under the terms of the management agreements or their\nguarantees, SVC reflects such fundings in its condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) as a reduction of hotel operating expenses. When\nthese shortfalls are replenished by cash flows from the applicable hotel operations in excess of the owner's priority return due, SVC reflects such\nreplenishment in its condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) as an increase to hotel operating expenses. There were no adjustments\nrequired for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The net increase to\nhotel operating expenses was $140 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n3. Transaction related costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $115 and $1,933, respectively, primarily consisted of costs\nrelated to hotel rebranding activity, the demolition of certain vacant properties, and potential acquisitions.\n4. SVC recorded a net loss on asset impairment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $13,692 and $51,030, respectively, to\nreduce the carrying value of four hotels and two net lease properties in the three month period, and ten hotels and eight net lease properties in the\nnine month period, to their estimated fair value or estimated fair value less costs to sell.\nSVC recorded a net loss on asset impairment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $512 and $9,517,respectively, to reduce\nthe carrying value of three net lease properties in the three month period, and 16 net lease properties in the nine month period, to their estimated\nfair value less costs to sell.\n5. SVC recorded a net gain on sale of real estate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $4,105 and $1,110, respectively, in\nconnection with the sales of six hotels and four net lease properties in the three month period, and seven hotels and seven net lease properties in\nthe nine month period.\nSVC recorded a net gain on sale of real estate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $123 and $41,959, respectively, in\nconnection with the sales of two net lease properties in the three month period, and 18 hotels and four net lease properties in the nine month\nperiod.\n6. SVC recorded a net loss on early extinguishment of debt during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $133 and $16,181,\nrespectively, in connection with a make-whole premium and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and discounts relating to the\nredemption of its $800,000 senior unsecured notes due 2025 and the purchase and satisfaction and discharge pursuant to a cash tender offer of its\n$350,000 senior unsecured notes due 2025.\nSVC recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of $282 in connection with the write off of\nunamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized discounts relating to the amendment of its revolving credit facility and the repayment of\ncertain unsecured senior notes.\n7. SVC is amortizing a liability it recorded for the fair value of its initial investment in Sonesta as a reduction to hotel operating expenses in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of income (loss). SVC reduced hotel operating expenses by $621 for each of the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, related to this liability, and $1,863 for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to this\nliability.\n27\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nSVC presents certain “non-GAAP financial measures” within the meaning of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules, including\nFFO, Normalized FFO, CAD, EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, EBITDAreand Adjusted EBITDAre. These measures do not represent cash generated by operating\nactivities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as indicators of SVC's operating performance or as\nmeasures of its liquidity. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in SVC's condensed consolidated\nstatements of income (loss). SVC considers these non-GAAP measures to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT,\nalong with net income (loss). SVC believes these measures provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical\namounts, such as depreciation and amortization expense, they may facilitate a comparison of its operating performance betweenperiods and with other\nREITs and, in the case of Hotel EBITDA, reflecting only those income and expense items that are generated and incurred at thehotel level may help both\ninvestors and management to understand the operations of its hotels.\nFFO and Normalized FFO: SVC calculates funds from operations, or FFO, and normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, as shown on page\n23. FFO is calculated on the basis defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which is net income (loss), calculated in\naccordance with GAAP, excluding any gain or loss on sale of real estate and loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any,plus real estate depreciation and\namortization, less any gains on equity securities, as well as adjustments to reflect SVC's share of FFO attributable to an investee and certain other\nadjustments currently not applicable to SVC. In calculating Normalized FFO, SVC adjusts for the items shown on page 23. FFO and Normalized FFO are\namong the factors considered by SVC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to SVC's shareholders. Other factors include, but\nare not limited to, requirements to satisfy its REIT distribution requirements, the availability to SVC of debt and equity capital, SVC's distribution rate as a\npercentage of the trading price of its common shares, or dividend yield, and to the dividend yield of other REITs, SVC's expectation of its future capital\nrequirements and operating performance and its expected needs for and availability of cash to pay its obligations. Other realestate companies and REITs\nmay calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than SVC does.\nCash Available for Distribution:SVC calculates cash available for distribution, or CAD, as shown on page 23. SVC defines CAD as Normalized FFO minus\nSVC’s proportionate share of Normalized FFO from its equity method investment, plus operating cash flow distributions from its equity method investment,\nif any, less recurring real estate related capital expenditures and adjusted for other non-cash and nonrecurring items. CAD is among the factors considered\nby SVC's Board of Trustees when determining the amount of distributions to SVC's shareholders. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate CAD\ndifferently than SVC does.\nEBITDA, EBITDAreand Adjusted EBITDAre:SVC calculates earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, EBITDA for real\nestate, or EBITDAre,and Adjusted EBITDAreas shown on page 24. EBITDAreis calculated on the basis defined by Nareit, which is EBITDA, excluding gains\nand losses on the sale of real estate, loss on impairment of real estate assets, if any, and adjustments to reflect SVC's share of EBITDAreattributable to an\ninvestee. In calculating Adjusted EBITDAre, SVC adjusts for the items shown on page 24. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate EBITDA,\nEBITDAreand Adjusted EBITDAredifferently than SVC does.\nHotel EBITDA: SVCcalculates Hotel EBITDA as hotel operating revenues less hotel operating expenses of all managed and leased hotels, prior to any\nadjustments required for presentation in its condensed consolidated statements of income (loss) in accordance with GAAP. SVC believes that Hotel EBITDA\nprovides useful information to management and investors as a key measure of the profitability of its hotel operations.\n28\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions\n(Continued)\nOther Definitions\nAnnualized Minimum Rent:Generally, SVC's lease agreements with its net lease tenants require payment of minimum rent to SVC. Certain of these\nminimum rent payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. Annualized minimum rent represents cash amounts and excludes adjustments,\nif any, necessary to record scheduled rent changes on a straight line basis or any expense reimbursements. Annualized minimumrent for TA excludes the\nimpact of rents prepaid by TA.\nAverage Daily Rate:ADR represents rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights sold in a given period. ADR provides useful insight on\npricing at SVC's hotels\nand is a measure widely used in the hotel industry.\nChain Scale: As characterized by STR Global Limited, a data benchmark and analytics provider for the lodging industry.\nComparable Hotels Data:SVCpresents RevPAR, ADR and occupancy for the periods presented on a comparable basis to facilitate comparisons\nbetween periods. SVC defines comparable hotels as those that it owned on September30, 2024 and were open and operating for the entirety of the\nperiods being compared. For each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SVC's comparable results exclude one hotel that was not\nowned for the entirety of the periods being compared. For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, SVC's comparable results\nexclude two hotels. One of the hotels was not owned for the entirety of the periods presented and the other suspended operationsduring part of the\nperiods presented.\nDebt: Debt amounts reflect the principal balance as of the date reported. Net debt means total debt less unrestricted cash and cashequivalents as of the\ndate reported.\nExit Hotels:Exit Hotels represent 130 hotels (114 focused service hotels announced to be sold in October 2024 and 16 hotels previously announced to\nbe sold) with an aggregate of 16,935 keysmanaged by Sonesta that SVC plans to sell and include 93 extended stay hotels and 37 select service hotels.\nFF&E Reserves: FF&E Reserves, or FF&E Reserves from managed hotel operations, represent various percentages of total sales at certain of SVC's hotels\nthat are escrowed as reserves for future renovations or refurbishments, or FF&E Reserve escrows. SVC owns all the FF&E Reserve escrows for its hotels.\nGain on Equity Securities, Net: Gain on equity securities, net represents the adjustment required to adjust the carrying value of SVC's former investment\nin shares of TA common stock to its fair value.\nGross Book Value of Real Estate Assets: Gross book value of real estate assets is real estate properties at cost plus acquisition related costs, if any,\nbefore purchase price allocations, less impairment write-downs, if any.\nHotel EBITDA Margin:Hotel EBITDA as a percentage of hotel operating revenues.\nInvestment: SVC defines hotel investment as historical cost of its properties plus capital improvements funded by it less impairment write-downs, if any,\nand excludes capital improvements made from FF&E Reserves funded from hotel operations that do not result in increases in owner’s priority return or\nrents. SVC defines net lease investment as historical cost of its properties plus capital improvements funded by SVC less impairment write-downs, if any.\n29\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Certain Definitions\n(Continued)\nOccupancy:Occupancy represents the total number of room nights sold divided by the total number of room nights available at a hotel or group of hotels\nand represents occupied properties as of the end of the period shown for net lease properties. Occupancy is an important measureof the utilization rate and\ndemand of SVC's properties.\nNon-Cash Expenses: Non-cash expenses represent general and administrative expense paid in common shares and amortization of liabilities relating to\nSVC’s initial investment in Sonesta and its former investment in The RMR Group, Inc.\nNon-Cash Interest Expense:Non-cash interest expense represents amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.\nNon-Cash Revenues: Non-cash revenues represent straight-line rent adjustments, lease value amortization, FF&E Reserves, including interest income\nearned, and the impact of rents prepaid by TA.\nOwner's priority return: Each of its management agreements or leases with hotel operators provides for payment to SVC of an annual owner’s priority\nreturn or minimum rent, respectively. Certain of these minimum payment amounts are secured by full or limited guarantees. In addition, certain of its hotel\nmanagement agreements provide for payment to SVC of additional amounts to the extent of available cash flows as defined in the management agreement.\nPayments of these additional amounts are not guaranteed.\nRent Coverage: SVC defines rent coverage as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent, or EBITDAR, divided by theannual\nminimum rent due to SVC weighted by the minimum rent of the property to total minimum rents of the net lease portfolio. Tenants with no minimum rent\nrequired under the lease are excluded. EBITDAR amounts used to determine rent coverage are generally for the latest twelve monthperiod, based on the\nmost recent operating information, if any, furnished by the tenant. Operating statements furnished by the tenant often are unaudited and, in certain cases,\nmay not have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not independently verified by SVC. In instances where SVC does nothave tenant financial\ninformation, it calculates an implied coverage ratio for the period based on other tenants with available financial statements operating the same brand or\nwithin the same industry. As a result, SVC believes using this implied coverage metric provides a more reasonable estimated representation of recent\noperating results and the financial condition for those tenants.\nRetained Hotels: Retained Hotels represent 59 hotels with an aggregate of 15,843 keysmanaged by Sonesta that SVC will continue to own after the Exit\nHotels are sold and include 39 full service hotels, 14 extended stay hotels and six select service hotels.\nRevenue per Available Room:RevPAR represents rooms revenue divided by the total number of room nights available to guests for a given period.\nRevPAR is an industry metric correlated to occupancy and ADR and helps measure revenue performance over comparable periods.\nSOFR:SOFR is the secured overnight financing rate.\nTotal Gross Assets: Total gross assets is total assets plus accumulated depreciation.\n30\nInvestor\nPresentation\nNovember 2024 | Nasdaq: SVC\nTwo Newton Place\n255 Washington Street,\nSuite 300\nNewton, MA 02458\nSVCREIT.COM\n31"
