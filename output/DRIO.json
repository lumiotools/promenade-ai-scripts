(Nasdaq: DRIO) (\"Dario\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in the global digital health market, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, highlighting substantial improvements in financial performance and business momentum.\n\n![DarioHealth Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1920436/DarioHealth_Logo.jpg)\n\nThe Company delivered revenue growth and multiple key client wins, laying a solid foundation for 2025. These achievements not only demonstrate continued progress in financial metrics, but also reflect the successful execution of long-term strategic initiatives aimed at driving sustainable growth.\n\n\"Our third quarter included strong execution of our multi-year strategic plan of being a profitable provider of comprehensive chronic care management solutions which engage members and improve outcomes at a reduced cost of care,\" said Erez Raphael, CEO of Dario. \"Our efforts to streamline costs following the Twill merger, combined with revenue growth across multiple channels, have positioned us for ongoing success. We're seeing clear progress in our transformation, and we remain focused on achieving profitability run rate by the end of 2025.\"\n\nThe Company reported improvement across all key financial metrics, both sequentially and year-over-year. Q3 revenue reached **$7.42 million** , an increase of **18.7%** from Q2 2024 and a **111%** increase compared to Q3 2023, driven primarily by growth in the Company's core Business-to-Business-to-Consumer (B2B2C) business.\n\nThrough continued optimization of revenue channels and a transition to recurring revenue models, gross margins for the B2B2C business rose to **83%** , with full business gross margins reaching **52%** and pro-forma gross margins reaching **70.3%** (on a non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basis).\n\nFollowing the recent acquisition of Twill, Dario implemented focused cost-management strategies, reducing GAAP operating expenses to **$15.9 million** , a **16%** sequential reduction from Q2 2024 and non-GAAP operating expenses to $12.3 million, a 15.9% reduction from Q2 2024.\n\n\"We are not just growing; we believe that we are improving the quality and predictability of our revenues,\" said **Steven Nelson** , Chief Commercial Officer at Dario. \"Securing 10 new clients this quarter, combined with diversifying our revenue streams, ensures that we are on a path for sustained success in 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nThe Company reported a **25.7%** reduction in GAAP operating losses sequentially, lowering such losses to $12 million, and **33.3%** reduction in non-GAAP operating losses, lowering such losses to **$7.1 million**.\n\nLooking ahead, Dario expects this positive trend in financial performance to continue, driven by ongoing revenue growth, increasing gross margins due to positive mix shift and operating leverage related to our reduced fixed expenses. The Company anticipates a 38**%** reduction in total operating expenses between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, alongside a 49**%** reduction in operating losses and a 59% reduction in non-GAAP operating losses respectively, paving the way to achieve **cash flow breakeven run rate by the end of 2025**.\n\n**Business Highlights**\n\nIn Q3, the Company enhanced its commercial momentum by securing **10 new clients** , positioning itself for strong growth in 2025. Dario focused on not only increasing revenues but also making them more sustainable by diversifying across channels and clients. This effort included transforming the pharma channel—previously the Company's only non-recurring revenue stream—into a recurring revenue model.\n\n  * **Health Plans** : The Company partnered with **National Medicare Health Plan Partners** and Twill by Dario to promote healthy aging and launched large-scale cardiometabolic programs in the Medicaid space.\n  * **Employers** : Dario signed contracts with **seven new employers** , primarily for cardiometabolic solutions, and secured its **first health system as an employer contract**. Additionally, the Company announced a new **AARP benefit** granting access to **millions of AARP members** for health and well-being programs starting in January 2025.\n  * **Pharma and Medical Device** : Dario closed two **new deals** , including a major contract with one of the top six global pharmaceutical companies and an agreement with a medical device company. The Company expects these contracts will contribute to revenue in the near term and are structured under the Company's new **\"platform services subscription fee\"** model, offering an annual recurring revenue stream.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this quarter marked the completion of the integration of Twill's capabilities into Dario's full multi-condition platform. The combined behavioral health, well-being, navigation, and engagement technologies now create the most comprehensive solution in the digital health market under the Dario brand.\n\n\"We are excited about the growing opportunities for our artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, especially as data becomes an increasingly vital asset in our business model,\" **Erez Raphael** added. \"By integrating generative AI and microservices, we believe we are poised to revolutionize areas like drug discovery, consumer engagement, and personalization, with our proprietary data setting us up for both internal and external monetization.\"\n\nWith its market-leading expertise, Dario is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends and continue delivering value to its stakeholders.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results Summary**\n\nRevenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $7.42 million, an 111% increase from $3.52 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and an increase of 18.7% from $6.26 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, resulted from an increase in revenues from the B2B2C channel and the consolidation of Twill revenues.\n\nB2B2C, employers and health plans recurring revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $5.44 million compared to $1.29 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023, representing an increase of 320%, and compared to $5.54 million in the second quarter of 2024, representing a decrease of 1.9% sequentially.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $3.9 million, an increase of $3.3 million or 534%, compared to gross profit of $610,000 for the third quarter of 2023, and an increase of 41% from $2.76 million for the second quarter of 2024. The reason for this increase is the increase in our B2B2C revenues. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 52.2% in the third quarter of 2024, from 17.3% in the third quarter of 2023, and 44.1% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nPro-forma gross profit, excluding $1.34 million of amortization expenses related to the acquisition of technology, was $5.2 million, or 70.3% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to pro-forma gross profit of $1.7 million, or 48.8% of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and a pro-forma gross profit of $4.0 million, or 63.8% of revenues, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $15.9 million compared to $16.2 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, and $18.9 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.25 million, or 1.5%, compared to the third quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $3 million, or 16%, compared to the second quarter of 2024. The decrease compared to the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, resulted mainly from reduction in operating expenses. The decrease compared to the second quarter of 2024 resulted mainly from a decrease in operating expenses and stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and depreciation for the third quarter of 2024 were $12.3 million compared to $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2023, and $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nOperating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $12 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 23%, compared to $15.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $4.2 million, or 25.7%, compared to $16.2 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due to the increase in the gross profit. The decrease compared to the second quarter of 2024 was mainly due to the decrease in operating expenses.\n\nFinancing expenses were $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to financing expenses of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The reason for this increase was due to changes in variable items included in the financing expenses.\n\nNet loss was $12.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 21.6%, compared to a net loss of $15.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $1.3 million, or 9.4%, compared to $13.6 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nNet loss excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition related expenses and depreciation for the third quarter of 2024 was $7.4 million compared to a loss of $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2023, and a net loss of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\n**Financial Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024:**\n\nRevenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $19.4 million, a 16.1% increase from $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $9.1 million, an increase of 55%, or $3.2 million, compared to gross profit of $5.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nPro-forma gross profit, excluding $3.7 million of amortization of expenses related to acquisitions, was $12.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a pro-forma gross profit of $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Pro-forma gross profit margin, excluding amortization of acquisition related expenses, was 65.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 54.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nTotal operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $55.1 million, an increase of $7.3 million, or 15.3%, compared with $47.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase resulted from the acquisition of Twill. Total operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition related expenses and depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were $39.7 million compared to $32.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nOperating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by $4.1 million to $46.1 million, compared to a $42 million operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase is mainly due to the increase in operating expenses.\n\nFinancing income was $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to financing expense of $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The reason for this increase was the revaluation of the pre-funded warrants issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Twill, due to its classification as a liability according to GAAP rules.\n\nNet loss was $33.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $45.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Statements that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"potential,\" \"seek,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"estimate\" or \"continue\" are intended to identify forward-looking statements. For example, when the Company discusses its expected reduced operating expenses expected by Q1 2025 and the resulting operating losses by such time period, that it expects to reach breakeven by the end of 2025, its expected breakeven timeline is supported by its progress in its high margin B2B2C channel, that its reduction of costs following the acquisition of Twill, combined with revenue growth across multiple channels, positions the Company for ongoing success, that it believes it sees clear progress in its transformation and remains focused on achieving a profitably run rate by the end of 2025, that it expects the positive trends in financial performance to continue, driven by ongoing revenue growth, increasing gross margins due to positive mix shift and operating leverage related to its reduced fixed expenses, its expected reduction in total operating expenses between Q1 2024 and Q1 2025, its expected reduction in operating losses and in non-GAAP operating losses respectively, paving the way to achieve cash flow breakeven run rate by the end of 2025, that it is positioned for strong growth in 2025, its plan to transform its pharmaceutical channel into a recurring revenue model, that its belief that two new contracts with a pharmaceutical company and a medical device company will contribute to the Company's revenue in the near term, its belief that the combined behavioral health, well-being, navigation, and engagement technologies now create the most comprehensive solution in the digital health market under the Dario brand, its belief that, by integrating generative AI and microservices, the Company is poised to revolutionize areas like drug discovery, consumer engagement, and personalization, with our proprietary data setting us up for both internal and external monetization and its belief that with its market-leading expertise, Dario is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends and continue delivering value to its stakeholders. Readers are cautioned that certain important factors may affect the Company's actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that may be made in this news release. Factors that may affect the Company's results include, but are not limited to, regulatory approvals, product demand, market acceptance, impact of competitive products and prices, product development, commercialization or technological difficulties, the success or failure of negotiations and trade, legal, social and economic risks, and the risks associated with the adequacy of existing cash resources. Additional factors that could cause or contribute to differences between the Company's actual results and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned that actual results (including, without limitation, the timing for and results of the Company's commercial and regulatory plans for Dario™ as described herein) may differ significantly from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe have provided in this release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with peer companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided in the financial statement tables below.\n\n_Operating expenses (non-GAAP)_. Our presentation of non-GAAP operating expenses excludes stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquisition related expenses and depreciation of fixed assets. Due to varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash expenses provides us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.\n\n_Net loss (non-GAAP)_. Our presentation of adjusted net loss excludes the effect of certain items that are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net loss represents net loss determined under GAAP without regard to stock-based compensation expenses, deferred inventory, depreciation of fixed assets, earn-out remeasurement and acquisition related expenses and amortization. We believe these measures provide useful information to management and investors for analysis of our operating results.\n\n**_DARIOHEALTH CORP.

(Nasdaq: DRIO) (\"Dario\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in the global digital health market, announced today a new collaboration with a pharma company that will utilize Dario Connect (formerly Twill Care) among their patient populations to further their direct-to-consumer efforts using Dario's refined engagement and navigation technologies.\n\n![DarioHealth_Logo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1920436/DarioHealth_Logo.jpg)\n\nIn an effort to strengthen and expand connections across patient populations that are candidates for a new drug to treat psoriasis, a top pharmaceutical company chose Dario to pilot a cutting-edge initiative aimed to help onboard patients that will engage with the drug via the platform. This collaboration is designed to collect critical insights on patient outcomes and drug effectiveness, with Dario Connect's innovative community-building capabilities playing a key role in enhancing patient engagement.\n\nDario Connect's collaboration goes beyond just connecting patients with the new drug. As part of the contract, a participating consumer health platform will work in congruence with the pharma company to enable patients to aggregate all of their medical records in one place. This allows the pharmaceutical companies to access de-identified, aggregate data to monitor patient outcomes and gain insights into prescription trends for the drug. The financial structure of the collaboration with Dario will start with a fixed configuration fee, followed by a platform and services subscription fee structure that allows Dario Connect to continue to bring engaged patients directly to the pharma company's digital environment.\n\n\"Dario Connect's advanced approach aims to redefine how pharmaceutical companies engage with patients, offering unparalleled opportunities for data-driven insights and patient support that can shape the future of healthcare. We are excited to stand at the forefront of this industry trend, with this new and innovative use for our product, especially with one of the top ten global and top six U.S. pharma companies. We believe that we have great momentum in our pharma channel pipeline, and we anticipate seeing more recurring revenue-based collaborations in this channel going forward,\" said Steven Nelson, Chief Commercial Officer at Dario.\n\n**About DarioHealth Corp.**\n\nDarioHealth Corp.
