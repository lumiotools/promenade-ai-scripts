(“Dentsply Sirona” or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: XRAY) today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThird quarter net sales of $951 million increased 0.5% (organic sales increased 1.3%) compared to the third quarter of 2023. Foreign currency changes negatively impacted third quarter 2024 net sales by ($8) million. Net loss was ($494) million, or ($2.46) per share, compared to a net loss of ($266) million, or ($1.25) per share in the third quarter of 2023. Non-cash charges for the impairment of goodwill were ($495) million net of tax, or ($2.46) per share in the third quarter of 2024, versus ($302) million net of tax, or ($1.42) per share in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.50, compared to $0.49 in the third quarter of 2023. A reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures (including organic sales, adjusted EBITDA and margin, adjusted EPS, adjusted free cash flow conversion, and segment adjusted operating income) to GAAP measures is provided below.\n\n“Third quarter organic growth was driven by favorable timing in Essential Dental Solutions of approximately $20 million related to stocking orders in anticipation of U.S. ERP deployment, and higher sales in CAD/CAM, which benefited from the launch of our new scanner, Primescan 2. Due to ongoing market pressures impacting equipment in the U.S., as well as the evolving landscape with Byte, we are lowering our full year organic sales outlook.” said Simon Campion, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to transform Dentsply Sirona and pivot quickly where needed. While we have more work to do, we now have multiple initiatives contributing positively to profitability and strengthening our Company’s foundation for the long term.”\n\n**Q3 24 Summary Results (GAAP)**\n\n**(in millions, except per share amount and percentages)**| **Q3 24**| **Q3 23**| **YoY**  \n---|---|---|---  \nNet Sales| $951| $947|  _0.5%_  \nGross Profit| $495| $495|  _0.2%_  \nGross Margin| 52.1%| 52.2%  \nNet Loss Attributable to Dentsply Sirona| ($494)| ($266)| _NM_  \nDiluted Loss Per Share [1]| ($2.46)| ($1.25)| _NM_  \n  \n**Q3 24 Summary Results (Non-GAAP)**[2]\n\n**(in millions, except per share amount and percentages)**| **Q3 24**| **Q3 23**| **YoY**  \n---|---|---|---  \nNet Sales| $951| $947|  _0.5%_  \n_Organic Sales Growth %_| _1.3%_  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $170| $171|  _(1.8%)_  \n_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_|  _17.9%_| _18.3%_  \nAdjusted EPS| $0.50| $0.49|  _3.0%_  \n  \nNM - not meaningfulPercentages are based on actual values and may not reconcile due to rounding.[1] Because the Company recorded net losses in the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, no potential dilutive common shares were used in the computation of diluted loss per common share as the effect would have been antidilutive.[2] Organic sales growth, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS are Non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items. Please refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a description of these measures and to the tables at the end of this release for a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP measures.\n\n**Q3 24 Segment Results**\n\n**Net Sales Growth %**| **Organic Sales Growth %**  \n---|---  \nConnected Technology Solutions|  _(2.3%)_| _(1.4%)_  \nEssential Dental Solutions|  _6.6%_| _7.5%_  \nOrthodontic and Implant Solutions|  _(4.6%)_| _(3.9%)_  \nWellspect Healthcare|  _(0.4%)_| _—%_  \nTotal|  _0.5%_| _1.3%_  \n  \n**Q3 24 Geographic Results**\n\n**Net Sales Growth %**| **Organic Sales Growth %**  \n---|---  \nUnited States|  _5.0%_| _5.1%_  \nEurope|  _(1.8%)_| _(2.0%)_  \nRest of World|  _(3.0%)_| _0.6%_  \nTotal|  _0.5%_| _1.3%_  \n  \n**Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\nOperating cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 was $141 million, compared to $134 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the favorable timing of accounts payable and improved inventory management. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company paid $33 million in dividends and executed share repurchases of $100 million, resulting in a total of $345 million returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the first nine months of 2024. The Company had $296 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**Goodwill Impairment**\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill of ($495) million net of tax within the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value for this reporting unit was driven by sustained macroeconomic pressures, legislative trends impacting Byte, weakened demand and competitive pressures in implants, and lower expected volumes of lab materials.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company is revising its 2024 outlook due to market pressures impacting U.S. equipment, legislative changes affecting the direct-to-consumer aligner business model, and the voluntary suspension of sales, marketing, and shipments of Byte Aligners and Impression Kits. The revised outlook includes expected net sales in the range of $3.79 billion to $3.83 billion, and organic sales are expected to be in the range of (3.5%) to (2.5%) year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.82 to $1.86. The outlook does not include potential adjustments or impacts of additional Byte remediation measures or decisions made by the Company.\n\nOther 2024 outlook assumptions are included in the third quarter 2024 earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of the Dentsply Sirona website at <https://investor.dentsplysirona.com>. The Company does not provide forward-looking estimates on a GAAP basis as certain information, which may include, but is not limited to, restructuring charges, transformation-related costs, impairment charges, certain tax adjustments, and other significant items, is not available without unreasonable effort and cannot be reasonably estimated. The exact amounts of these charges or credits are not currently determinable but may be significant.\n\n**Conference Call/Webcast Information** Dentsply Sirona’s management team will host an investor conference call and live webcast on November 7, 2024, at 8:30 am ET. A live webcast of the investor conference call and a presentation related to the call will be available on the Investors section of the Company’s website at <https://investor.dentsplysirona.com>.\n\nFor those planning to participate on the call, please register at <https://register.vevent.com/register/BI2ff7dbae32e04372ac0f7b84f2806925>.

These Non-GAAP measures may differ from those used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP. These Non-GAAP measures are used by the Company to measure its performance and may differ from those used by other companies.\n\nManagement believes that these Non-GAAP measures are helpful as they provide a measure of the results of operations, and are frequently used by investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s performance exclusive of certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, and which may not be indicative of past or future performance of the Company.\n\nOrganic Sales\n\nThe Company defines \"organic sales\" as the reported net sales adjusted for: (1) net sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition; (2) net sales attributable to disposed businesses or discontinued product lines in both the current and prior year periods; and (3) the impact of foreign currency changes, which is calculated by translating current period net sales using the comparable prior period's foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nAdjusted Operating Income and Margin\n\nAdjusted operating income is computed by excluding the following items from operating income (loss) as reported in accordance with US GAAP:\n\n(1) Business combination-related costs and fair value adjustments. These adjustments include costs related to consummating and integrating acquired businesses, as well as net gains and losses related to disposed businesses. In addition, this category includes the post-acquisition roll-off of fair value adjustments recorded related to business combinations, except for amortization expense of purchased intangible assets noted below. Although the Company is regularly engaged in activities to find and act on opportunities for strategic growth and enhancement of product offerings, the costs associated with these activities may vary significantly between periods based on the timing, size and complexity of acquisitions and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.\n\n(2) Restructuring-related charges and other costs. These adjustments include costs related to the implementation of restructuring initiatives, including but not limited to, severance costs, facility closure costs, and lease and contract termination costs, as well as related professional service costs associated with these restructuring initiatives and global transformation activity. The Company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency; consequently, restructuring charges may recur but are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity, and as such may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company. Other costs include gains and losses on the sale of property, legal settlements, executive separation costs, write-offs of inventory as a result of product rationalization, and changes in accounting principles recorded within the period. This category also includes costs related to investigations, related ongoing legal matters and associated remediation activities which primarily include legal, accounting and other professional service fees, as well as turnover and other employee-related costs.\n\n(3) Goodwill and intangible asset impairments. These adjustments include charges related to goodwill and intangible asset impairments.\n\n(4) Amortization of purchased intangible assets. This adjustment excludes the periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets, which are recorded at fair value. Although these costs contribute to revenue generation and will recur in future periods, their amounts are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, and as such may not be indicative of the future performance of the Company.\n\n(5) Fair value and credit risk adjustments. These adjustments include the non-cash mark-to-market changes in fair value associated with pension assets and obligations, and equity-method investments. Although these adjustments are recurring in nature, they are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in the underlying assumptions and market conditions. The non-service component of pension expense is a recurring item, however it is subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to changes in actuarial assumptions, interest rates, plan changes, settlements, curtailments, and other changes in facts and circumstances. As such, these items may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company.\n\nAdjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales.\n\nAdjusted Gross Profit\n\nAdjusted gross profit is computed by excluding from gross profit the impact of any of the above adjustments on either sales or cost of sales.\n\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss)\n\nAdjusted net income (loss) consists of net income (loss) as reported in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted to exclude the items identified above, as well as the related income tax impacts of those items. Additionally, net income is adjusted for other tax-related adjustments such as: discrete adjustments to valuation allowances and other uncertain tax positions, final settlement of income tax audits, discrete tax items resulting from the implementation of restructuring initiatives and the windfall or shortfall relating to exercise of employee share-based compensation, any difference between the interim and annual effective tax rate, and adjustments relating to prior periods.\n\nThese adjustments are irregular in timing, and the variability in amounts may not be indicative of past and future performance of the Company and therefore are excluded for comparability purposes.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Margin\n\nIn addition to the adjustments described above in arriving at adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA is computed by further excluding any remaining interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by net sales.\n\nAdjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Diluted Share\n\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per diluted share (adjusted EPS) is computed by dividing adjusted earnings (loss) attributable to Dentsply Sirona shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow and Conversion\n\nThe Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures during the same period, and adjusted free cash flow conversion is defined as adjusted free cash flow divided by adjusted net income (loss). Management believes this Non-GAAP measure is important for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance as it measures our ability to efficiently generate cash from our business operations relative to earnings. It should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income (loss) as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.\n\n**DENTSPLY SIRONA INC.****AND SUBSIDIARIES**(In millions, except percentages)(unaudited)  \n---  \nA reconciliation of reported net sales to organic sales by geographic region is as

(“Dentsply Sirona” or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq: XRAY), today announced the voluntary suspension of sales and marketing of its Byte Aligners and Impression Kits while the Company conducts a review of certain regulatory requirements related to these products. The Company’s decision was made in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nIn connection with this review, and Dentsply Sirona’s proactive efforts to continuously improve its processes, the Company has suspended shipment and processing of new and recently placed orders for Byte Aligners and Impression Kits.\n\nThe Company holds itself to the highest standards of quality and compliance with patient safety at the center of everything we do. To that end, we will continue to work closely with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, while communicating with treating dentists and their patients to support their continued care as appropriate.\n\nIndependent of the above matter, the state regulatory environment has adversely impacted our Byte Aligner business model, resulting in declining conversion rates, and new documentation, records and additional requirements (such as evidence of visits to a dentist or patient x-rays). As a result, we had begun to assess our resources at Byte to leverage and/or redeploy infrastructure, talent, and capability elsewhere in our business. Examples include augmenting resources to improve other software platforms, accelerating DS Core functionality, and enhancing the patient experience.\n\nAdditional details regarding today’s announcement can be found in the Company’s Form 8-K that was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n**Select Preliminary Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nDentsply Sirona is also announcing select preliminary financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (“third quarter 2024”). The Company expects to report third quarter 2024 net sales of approximately $951 million and adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.49 and $0.51. For the third quarter 2024, the Company expects to report year-over-year net sales growth in Essential Dental Solutions, partially offset by declines in Orthodontic and Implant Solutions and Connected Technology Solutions segments. Wellspect Healthcare net sales are expected to be approximately flat due to timing with a large US distributor. Net sales and adjusted EPS were favorably impacted by a shift in the timing of distributor orders for Essential Dental Solutions products from the fourth quarter into the third quarter of approximately $20 million associated with the Company’s planned fourth quarter ERP implementation in North America. The Company does not provide preliminary estimates of EPS on a GAAP basis as certain information needed to prepare adjustments is not yet available and cannot be reasonably estimated. A description of the adjustments typically made to compute adjusted EPS can be found in Exhibit 99.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company expects to record non-cash charges for the impairment of goodwill within the range of $450 - $550 million, net of tax, pertaining to two of its reporting units, Orthodontic Aligner Solutions and Implants & Prosthetic Solutions, which together comprise the Orthodontic and Implant Solutions segment. The decline in fair value for the Orthodontic Aligner Solutions reporting unit is driven primarily by adverse impacts from state regulatory trends pertaining to the Company’s Byte Aligner business, while the decline in fair value for the Implants & Prosthetic Solutions reporting unit is driven by weakened demand in conjunction with competitive pricing pressures and adverse impacts of ongoing global conflicts in certain markets, as well as lower long-term expectations for volumes of lab materials. These factors contributed to reductions to forecasted revenues, lower operating margins, and expectations for lower future cash flows in the near term, resulting in an impairment during the third quarter for the aforementioned reporting units.\n\nThe Company will evaluate and assess the appropriate next steps for Byte, with the goal of continuing to provide access to quality oral care to underserved populations. In connection with this assessment, the Company may incur additional impairments and write-offs regarding this business, which may be material in the current and future periods.\n\nThe preliminary estimates above are based solely upon information available to management as of the date of this press release and are subject to change. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to the completion of its quarter-end closing procedures, final adjustments and developments that may arise or information that may become available between now and the time the Company’s financial results are finalized and included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\nDentsply Sirona will provide further updates on the business and its performance including an update to its 2024 full year outlook during its third quarter 2024 earnings call, which has been scheduled for November 7, 2024. \n\n**About Dentsply Sirona**\n\nDentsply Sirona is the world’s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies, with over a century of innovation and service to the dental industry and patients worldwide.
