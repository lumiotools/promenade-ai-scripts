(NASDAQ: TTMI) (“TTM”), a leading global manufacturer of technology solutions including mission systems, radio frequency (“RF”) components and RF microwave/microelectronic assemblies and printed circuit boards (“PCB”s) today reported results for the third quarter 2024, which ended on September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales were $616.5 million\n  * GAAP net income of $14.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $42.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, inclusive of a $17.8 million pre-tax, non-operational, foreign exchange loss\n  * Cash flow from operations was $65.1 million, or 10.6% of sales\n  * Book to bill of 1.20 for the third quarter\n  * A&D program backlog a record $1.49 billion\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results**\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $616.5 million, compared to $572.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $51.0 million compared to GAAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $10.2 million, inclusive of a $44.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to the RF&S Components segment.\n\nGAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $37.1 million, or ($0.36) per diluted share. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million pre-tax foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million pre-tax foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $42.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $44.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million pre-tax foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million pre-tax foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 was $84.4 million, or 13.7% of sales compared to adjusted EBITDA of $84.1 million, or 14.7% of sales for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“TTM delivered strong operating margin performance due to higher revenues, favorable mix, and outstanding operational execution. Revenues reflected the third consecutive quarter of year on year growth due to demand strength in our Aerospace and Defense and Data Center Computing end markets, the latter being driven by generative AI,” said Tom Edman, CEO of TTM. “In addition, cash flow from operations was a healthy 10.6% of revenues enabling the company to maintain a solid balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of 1.4x,” concluded Mr. Edman.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, TTM estimates that revenues will be in the range of $610 million to $650 million, and non-GAAP net income will be in the range of $0.44 to $0.50 per diluted share. \n\nWith respect to the Company’s outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty or without unreasonable effort certain items that may affect a comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our expected non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes primarily the future impact of restructuring actions, impairment charges, unusual gains and losses, and tax adjustments. These reconciling items are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control and could have a material impact on our future period net income per diluted share calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income per diluted share to a comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP has not been provided because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. For the same reasons, TTM is unable to address the probable significance of the information.\n\n**Live Webcast/Conference Call** TTM will host a conference call and webcast to discuss third quarter 2024 results and the fourth quarter 2024 outlook on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time).

The company’s actual results when disclosed in its Form 10-Q may differ from these preliminary results as a result of the completion of the company’s financial closing procedures, final adjustments, completion of the review by the company’s independent registered accounting firm, and other developments that may arise between now and the disclosure of the final results. This release contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or performance. TTM cautions you that such statements are simply predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. These statements reflect TTM's current expectations, and TTM does not undertake to update or revise these forward looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in this or other TTM statements will not be realized. Further, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond TTM's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, including interest rates, currency exchange rates, and consumer spending, demand for TTM's products, market pressures on prices of TTM's products, warranty claims, changes in product mix, contemplated significant capital expenditures and related financing requirements, TTM's dependence upon a small number of customers, and other factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the Company's public reports filed with the SEC.\n\n**About Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, this release includes information about TTM’s adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. TTM presents non-GAAP financial information to enable investors to see TTM through the eyes of management and to provide better insight into TTM’s ongoing financial performance.\n\nA material limitation associated with the use of the above non-GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measurement prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. TTM compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliations below to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Contact** :Sameer Desai,Vice President, Corporate Development & Investor Relations[Sameer.desai@ttmtech.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G8TXWxx6JZav2dEeU0nfj8jk--52YD2845QmscMIKGCRa7NgWAqW7ikM-__JdAvWoHFw8q5NL6iEmuiRU5bDr405a8_8QaXKiF4zOlUo_U8= \"Opens in a new window\")714-327-3050\n\n**TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.**\n\nSelected Unaudited Financial Information\n\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n\n**CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** | Third Quarter | First Three Quarters  \n---|---|---  \n2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \nNet sales | $ | 616,538 | $ | 572,582 | $  | 1,791,788 | $ | 1,663,528  \nCost of goods sold | 486,650 | 459,312 | 1,440,954 | 1,365,628  \nGross profit | 129,888 | 113,270 | 350,834 | 297,900  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling and marketing | 19,961 | 18,763 | 60,053 | 58,245  \nGeneral and administrative | 42,567 | 38,916 | 124,841 | 111,829  \nResearch and development | 8,054 | 6,173 | 23,922 | 19,682  \nAmortization of definite-lived intangibles | 6,951 | 11,429 | 28,636 | 37,245  \nImpairment of goodwill | -

Management believes that both measures -- which add back amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense on debt (before consideration of capitalized interest), gain on sale of property, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inventory markup, restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other charges as well as the associated tax impact of these charges and discrete tax items -- provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company's ongoing financial condition and results of operations.  \n5 Income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate.  \n6 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before income taxes, interest expense, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, gain on sale of property, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inventory markup, restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other charges. We present adjusted EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our operating results, and it is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations. In addition, we provide our adjusted EBITDA because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. However, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0ce6f860-e00c-449f-b450-e04671e0afdb/small/ttm-logo-with-tagline2021-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0ce6f860-e00c-449f-b450-e04671e0afdb)\n\nSource: TTM Technologies, Inc. \n\nReleased October 30, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.ttm.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

(“TTM”, “we” or the “Company”). The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “p lan,” “forecast,” “foresee,” “estimate,” “project,” “expect,” “seek,”\n“target,” “intend,” “goal” and other similar expressions, among others, generally identify “forward- looking statements,” which sp eak only as of the date the statements were made and are not\nguarantees of performance. Actual results may differ materially from these forward - looking statements. Such statements relate to a variety of matters, including but not limited to the operations of\nTTM’s businesses. These statements reflect the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of the management of TTM, and we b e lie v e such statements to have a reasonable basis.\nIt is uncertain whether any of the events anticipated by the forward- looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of the m do, what impact they will have on the results of operations and financial\ncondition of the Company. These forward- looking statements are based on assumptions that may not materialize, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,\nthat could cause actual events or performance to differ materially from those indicated in such forward- looking statements. Facto rs, risks, trends, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied in forward- looking statements include, but are not limited to pot ential changes in domestic or global economic conditions, demand for our\nproducts, market pressures on prices of our products, warranty claims, changes in product mix, contemplated significant capit al expenditures and related financing requirements, our dependence\nupon a small number of customers, and other factors set forth in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10- K and Quarter ly Report on Form 10- Q and in the Company’s other filings filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under the heading “Risk Factors”, and which are available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nTTM does not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements to reflect any new information, subsequent events or cir cumstances, or otherwise, except as may be required by law, even if\nexperience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed in this communication or future communications t o stockholders, press releases or Company statements will not be\nrealized. In addition, the inclusion of any statement in this communication does not constitute an admission by us that the ev ent s or circumstances described in such statement are material.\nUse of Non - G AAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), TTM uses certain non- GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA,\nAdjusted EBITDA, Non- GAAP Operating Income, Non- GAAP Net Income, Non- GAAP Operating Margin, Non- GAAP Gross Margin , Non- GAAP EPS and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow. We present\nnon-GAAP financial information to enable investors to see TTM through the eyes of management and to provide better insight into our ongoing financial performance.\n2\nDisclaimers (cont.)\nA material limitation associated with the use of the above non- GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measurem ent prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar\nnon- GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non - GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to the most directly\ncomparable GAAP financial measure. However, the non- GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nSee Appendix for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Non- GAAP Operating Income to the most comparable GAAP metric.\nData Used in This Presentation\nDue to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and per ce ntages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\nThird Party Information\nThe information contained herein does not purport to be all inclusive.

(NASDAQ: TTMI) (“TTM”), a leading global manufacturer of technology solutions including mission systems, radio frequency (“RF”) components and RF microwave/microelectronic assemblies and printed circuit boards (“PCB”s) today reported results for the third quarter 2024, which ended on September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales were $616.5 million\n  * GAAP net income of $14.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share\n  * Non-GAAP net income was $42.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, inclusive of a $17.8 million pre-tax, non-operational, foreign exchange loss\n  * Cash flow from operations was $65.1 million, or 10.6% of sales\n  * Book to bill of 1.20 for the third quarter\n  * A&D program backlog a record $1.49 billion\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 GAAP Financial Results**\n\nNet sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $616.5 million, compared to $572.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $51.0 million compared to GAAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $10.2 million, inclusive of a $44.1 million goodwill impairment charge related to the RF&S Components segment.\n\nGAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $37.1 million, or ($0.36) per diluted share. GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million pre-tax foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million pre-tax foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $42.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $44.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million pre-tax foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million pre-tax foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2024 was $84.4 million, or 13.7% of sales compared to adjusted EBITDA of $84.1 million, or 14.7% of sales for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 included a $17.8 million foreign exchange loss, compared to a $0.9 million foreign exchange gain in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n“TTM delivered strong operating margin performance due to higher revenues, favorable mix, and outstanding operational execution. Revenues reflected the third consecutive quarter of year on year growth due to demand strength in our Aerospace and Defense and Data Center Computing end markets, the latter being driven by generative AI,” said Tom Edman, CEO of TTM. “In addition, cash flow from operations was a healthy 10.6% of revenues enabling the company to maintain a solid balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of 1.4x,” concluded Mr. Edman.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, TTM estimates that revenues will be in the range of $610 million to $650 million, and non-GAAP net income will be in the range of $0.44 to $0.50 per diluted share. \n\nWith respect to the Company’s outlook for non-GAAP net income per diluted share, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty or without unreasonable effort certain items that may affect a comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our expected non-GAAP net income per diluted share excludes primarily the future impact of restructuring actions, impairment charges, unusual gains and losses, and tax adjustments. These reconciling items are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management’s control and could have a material impact on our future period net income per diluted share calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income per diluted share to a comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP has not been provided because the Company is unable to provide such reconciliation without unreasonable effort. For the same reasons, TTM is unable to address the probable significance of the information.\n\n**Live Webcast/Conference Call** TTM will host a conference call and webcast to discuss third quarter 2024 results and the fourth quarter 2024 outlook on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time).

The company’s actual results when disclosed in its Form 10-Q may differ from these preliminary results as a result of the completion of the company’s financial closing procedures, final adjustments, completion of the review by the company’s independent registered accounting firm, and other developments that may arise between now and the disclosure of the final results. This release contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or performance. TTM cautions you that such statements are simply predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. These statements reflect TTM's current expectations, and TTM does not undertake to update or revise these forward looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied in this or other TTM statements will not be realized. Further, these statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond TTM's control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general market and economic conditions, including interest rates, currency exchange rates, and consumer spending, demand for TTM's products, market pressures on prices of TTM's products, warranty claims, changes in product mix, contemplated significant capital expenditures and related financing requirements, TTM's dependence upon a small number of customers, and other factors set forth in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of the Company's public reports filed with the SEC.\n\n**About Our Non-GAAP Financial Measures** To supplement our consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, this release includes information about TTM’s adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. TTM presents non-GAAP financial information to enable investors to see TTM through the eyes of management and to provide better insight into TTM’s ongoing financial performance.\n\nA material limitation associated with the use of the above non-GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measurement prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. TTM compensates for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliations below to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Contact** :Sameer Desai,Vice President, Corporate Development & Investor Relations[Sameer.desai@ttmtech.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=G8TXWxx6JZav2dEeU0nfj8jk--52YD2845QmscMIKGCRa7NgWAqW7ikM-__JdAvWoHFw8q5NL6iEmuiRU5bDr405a8_8QaXKiF4zOlUo_U8= \"Opens in a new window\")714-327-3050\n\n**TTM TECHNOLOGIES, INC.**\n\nSelected Unaudited Financial Information\n\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n\n**CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS** | Third Quarter | First Three Quarters  \n---|---|---  \n2024  |  2023  |  2024  |  2023   \nNet sales | $ | 616,538 | $ | 572,582 | $  | 1,791,788 | $ | 1,663,528  \nCost of goods sold | 486,650 | 459,312 | 1,440,954 | 1,365,628  \nGross profit | 129,888 | 113,270 | 350,834 | 297,900  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling and marketing | 19,961 | 18,763 | 60,053 | 58,245  \nGeneral and administrative | 42,567 | 38,916 | 124,841 | 111,829  \nResearch and development | 8,054 | 6,173 | 23,922 | 19,682  \nAmortization of definite-lived intangibles | 6,951 | 11,429 | 28,636 | 37,245  \nImpairment of goodwill | -

Management believes that both measures -- which add back amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense on debt (before consideration of capitalized interest), gain on sale of property, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inventory markup, restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other charges as well as the associated tax impact of these charges and discrete tax items -- provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company's ongoing financial condition and results of operations.  \n5 Income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate.  \n6 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before income taxes, interest expense, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, stock-based compensation expense, gain on sale of property, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on sale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inventory markup, restructuring, acquisition-related costs, and other charges. We present adjusted EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our operating results, and it is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations. In addition, we provide our adjusted EBITDA because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements. However, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   \n  \n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/0ce6f860-e00c-449f-b450-e04671e0afdb/small/ttm-logo-with-tagline2021-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0ce6f860-e00c-449f-b450-e04671e0afdb)\n\nSource: TTM Technologies, Inc. \n\nReleased October 30, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Contacts](/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://investors.ttm.com/news-events/press-releases/rss \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n\n"

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder,\nthis conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024.\nSameer Desai, TTM Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations\nwill now review the TTM's disclosure statement.\nSameer Desai\nThank you. Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that today's call\ncontains forward-looking statements, including statements related to TTM's future\nbusiness outlook. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking\nstatements due to one or more risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors we\nprovide in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we\nencourage you to review.\nThese forward-looking statements represent management's expectations and\nassumptions based on currently available information. TTM does not undertake any\nobligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether\na result of new information, future events, or other circumstances, except as required by\nlaw.\nWe will also discuss on this call certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted\nEBITDA. Such measures should not be considered as a substitute for the measures\nprepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and we direct you to the\nreconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures included in the company's\nearnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations section of TTM's website\nat investors.ttm.com. We've also posted on that website a slide deck that we will refer to\nduring our call.\nI will now turn the call over to Tom Edman, TTM's Chief Executive Officer. Please go\nahead, Tom.\nThomas Edman\nThank you, Sameer. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter\n2024 conference call. I'll begin with a review of our business highlights from the quarter\nand a discussion of our third quarter results, followed by a summary of our business\nstrategy. Dan Boehle, our CFO, will follow with an overview of our Q3 2024 financial\nperformance and our Q4 2024 guidance. We will then open the call to your questions.\nHighlights of the quarter's financial results are summarized on Slide three of the\nearnings presentation posted on TTM's website. We delivered an excellent quarter, and\nI would like to thank our employees for their hard work and contributions in support of\nthese results. In the third quarter of 2024, TTM delivered strong operating margin\nperformance due to higher revenues, favorable mix, and outstanding operational\nexecution.\nRevenues were above the midpoint of the guided range, representing the third\nconsecutive quarter of year-on-year growth due to demand strength from our aerospace\nand defense and data center computing end markets, the latter being driven by\nGenerative AI.\nThe growth in revenues was partially offset by year-over-year declines from our\nmedical, industrial, and instrumentation and automotive end markets. Overall, the\ncompany book to bill was 1.20, with the A&D book to bill at 1.26 for the second\nconsecutive quarter. Demand in our aerospace and defense market, which was 46% of\nrevenues for the quarter continues to be strong, and we now have a record program\nbacklog of approximately $1.49 billion.\nI would now like to provide a strategic update. TTM is on a journey to transform our\nbusiness to be less cyclical and more differentiated. Over the past several years, TTM\nhas consistently emphasized that a key part of our strategy is to add value to the\nproduct solutions that we deliver to our customers, particularly in the aerospace and\ndefense market.\nAs a result of strategic transactions in the aerospace and defense end market through\nthe acquisitions of Anaren and Telephonics, over 50% of our revenues in aerospace\nand defense are now generated from engineered and integrated electronic products\nwith printed circuit boards contributing less than 50% overall. We have been executing\nagainst this strategy as our aerospace and defense and operations teams have steadily\nimproved operating margins.\nAnother important element of our differentiation strategy is our investment in a new\nstate-of-the-art highly automated PCB manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia to\nservice customers in our commercial end markets. This new facility in Malaysia is\nsupporting customers end markets such as data center computing, networking and\nmedical industrial and instrumentation.\nWe continue to make progress ramping volume production as we manage through\nongoing customer audits and qualifications. We registered revenues in the third quarter\nand expect our Malaysia facility to gain further revenue momentum in the fourth quarter\nas we continue our production ramp.\nI'd also like to update you on the consolidation of our manufacturing footprint. We\npreviously announced our plan to close three small printed circuit board manufacturing\nfacilities in order to improve total plant utilization, operational performance, customer\nfocus and profitability. During the course of 2023, PCB manufacturing operations in\nAnaheim and Santa Clara, California and Hong Kong were closed and consolidated into\nTTM's remaining facilities. We continue to ramp production for the transferred parts at\nreceiving facilities.\nWe also have plans to consolidate two smaller non-PCB integrated electronics facilities\nin Elizabeth City, North Carolina and Huntington, New York into existing facilities in\norder to improve efficiencies. This consolidation will occur over the next three quarters.\nAfter these consolidation plans are complete, TTM will operate a total of 22 facilities\nworldwide.\nFinally, I would like to update you on the previous announcement of our intent to expand\nour advanced technology capability for the aerospace and defense market through the\nconstruction of a new facility immediately adjacent to our existing Syracuse, New York\ncampus. This new facility will focus on specialized high technology printed circuit board\nproduction, providing customers with reduced lead times and a significant increase in\ndomestic capacity for Ultra HDI PCBs in support of increasing national security\nrequirements for high technology PCBs. We have broken ground for the new building\nand expect initial low-rate production in 2026.\nAs previously announced, we expect the investment for Phase 1 of the proposed\nproject, including capital for campus wide improvements to be in the range of between\n$100 million $130 million. We will be receiving support from both federal and state\nsources on the order of approximately $52 million subject to certain requirements and\ncontingencies, which will serve to offset the initial capital investment and lower\noperating expenses.\nThis month, we celebrated the groundbreaking with a beam signing ceremony at the\nsite of the new manufacturing building. TTM executives, the Governor of New York,\nother state and local officials and leading defense customers were present at this\nmilestone event.\nNow I'd like to review our end market which are referenced on Page four of the earnings\npresentation on our website. The aerospace and defense end market represented 46%\nof total third quarter sales, compared to 45% of Q3 2023 sales and 45% of sales in Q2\n2024. The solid demand in the defense market is a result of a positive tailwind in\nprevious defense budgets and supplemental funding related to conflicts in Ukraine and\nthe Middle East.\nOur strong strategic program alignment and key bookings for ongoing franchise\nprograms. We had a strong bookings quarter with a book to bill ratio of 1.26 for the\nsecond consecutive quarter, leading to a record A&D program backlog of approximately\n$1.49 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw significant\nbookings for SPY-7, MH-60R and the Japan Aerospace Defense Ground Environment\nprograms.\nWe expect sales in Q4 from this end market to represent about 45% of our total sales.\nBookings in the aerospace and defense market ship over a longer period of time than in\nour commercial markets and provide good visibility into future revenue growth.\nSales in the data center computing end market represented 19% of total sales in the\nthird quarter, compared to 17% in Q3 of 2023 and 21% in the second quarter of 2024.\nThis end market saw 20% year-on-year growth due to strength from our data center\ncustomers building products for Generative AI applications. Due to customer timing, we\nsaw some deliveries move from Q3 into Q4. As a result, we expect revenues in this end\nmarket to represent 21% of fourth quarter sales.\nThe medical, industrial, instrumentation end market contributed 14% of our total sales in\nthe third quarter compared to 16% in the year ago quarter and 14% in the second\nquarter of 2024. The year-over-year decline was generally the result of lower demand\nand ongoing inventory normalization, particularly in the industrial and medical areas. We\nsaw increased demand from our semiconductor testing customers as Generative AI\ndrove growth in the DRAM market, leading to increased purchases of automated test\nequipment. For the fourth quarter, we expect the medical, industrial, instrumentation\nend market to be 14% of revenues.\nAutomotive sales represented 14% of total sales during the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to 15% in the year ago quarter and 14% during the second quarter of 2024.\nThe year-over-year decline for automotive was due primarily to continued inventory\nadjustments and soft demand at several customers. We expect our automotive\nbusiness to contribute 12% of total sales in Q4 as the automotive end market remains\nchallenged in the near-term.\nNetworking accounted for 7% of revenue during the third quarter of 2024. This\ncompares to 7% in the third quarter of 2023 and 6% of revenue in the second quarter of\n2024. We saw a return to year-on-year growth due to recovering demand from certain\nnetworking customers. In Q4, we expect this end market to be 8% of revenues as this\nmarket continues to recover driven by AI related demand and new products.\nNext, I'll cover some details from the third quarter. This information is also available on\nPage five of our earnings presentation. During the quarter, our advanced technology\nand engineered products, which include HDI, rigid flex, RF subsystems and\ncomponents and engineered systems accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue.\nThis compares to approximately 47% in the year ago quarter and 45% in Q2. We are\ncontinuing to pursue new business opportunities and increase customer design\nengagement activities that will leverage our advanced technology and engineered\nproducts capabilities in new programs and new markets.\nPCB capacity utilization in Asia Pacific was 60% in Q3 compared to 46% in the year ago\nquarter 64% in Q2. On a year-on-year basis, utilization rates improved as data center\ndemand continues to be strong and other commercial markets started to rebound. Our\noverall PCB capacity utilization in North America was 35% in Q3 compared to 38% in\nthe year ago quarter and 39% in Q2.\nAs a reminder, North America utilization figures are not as meaningful as Asia Pacific,\nbecause bottlenecks in these high mix, low volume facilities tend to occur in areas\noutside of plating, which is the core process that we use for calculating utilization rates.\nOur top five customers contributed 41% of total sales in the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to 43% in the third quarter of 2023. We had 1 customer with over 10% of our\ntotal sales in the quarter. At the end of Q3, our 90-day backlog, which is subject to\ncancellations and includes shipments into customer hubs, was $638.9 million compared\nto $606.8 million at the end of the third quarter last year.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, our aerospace and defense program backlog increased\nfrom $1.35 billion at the end of Q3 last year to a record of $1.49 billion at the end of Q3\nthis year. Our overall book to bill ratio was 1.20 for the three months ended September\n30.\nNow Dan will review our financial performance for the third quarter. Dan?\nDaniel Boehle\nThanks, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone.\nI will review our financial results for the third quarter that were included in the press\nrelease distributed today and are summarized on Slide 6 of the earnings presentation\nposted on our website. For the third quarter, net sales were $616.5 million compared to\n$572.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase was due to\ngrowth in our data center computing and aerospace and defense end markets, partially\noffset by declines in our automotive, medical, industrial, and instrumentation end\nmarkets.\nGAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $51 million, as compared to\nGAAP operating loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $10.2 million, inclusive of a $44.1\nmillion goodwill impairment charge related to the RF&S component segment. On a\nGAAP basis, net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $14.3 million, or $0.14 per\ndiluted share. This compares to GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2023 of $37.1\nmillion, or a negative $0.36 per diluted share.\nThe remainder of my comments will focus on our non-GAAP financial performance. Our\nnon-GAAP performance excludes M&A related costs, restructuring costs, certain non-\ncash expense items such as amortization of intangibles, impairment of goodwill, stock\ncompensation, gains on the sale of property, and other unusual or infrequent items. We\npresent non-GAAP financial information to enable investors to see the company through\nthe eyes of management and to facilitate comparisons with expectations and prior\nperiods.\nGross margin in the third quarter was 22% and compares to 20.8% in the third quarter\nof 2023. The year-on-year increase was due to higher sales volume, particularly in this\naerospace and defense and data center computed end-market, and improved\noperational execution. Selling and marketing expense was $18.9 million in the third\nquarter, or 3.1% of net sales, versus $17.9 million, or 3.1% of net sales a year ago.\nThird quarter G&A expense was $36.4 million or 5.9% of net sales compared to $37.7\nmillion or 6.6% of net sales in the same quarter a year ago.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, research and development was $7.7 million, or 1.3% of net\nsales, compared to $5.9 million, or 1% of net sales in the same quarter last year. Our\noperating margin in third quarter of 2024 was 11.8%. A 170 basis points increase from\n10.1% in the same quarter last year. Interest expense was $11.3 million in the third\nquarter of 2024 compared to $9.6 million in the same quarter last year.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, there was a $17.8 million foreign exchange loss below\nthe operating income line, compared to a $0.9 million foreign exchange gain in the third\nquarter of 2023. The current year impact was primarily driven by unrealized foreign\nexchange losses from translation of our China and Malaysia balance sheets from local\ncurrency into the U.S. dollar functional currency, which experienced significant\ndevaluation against the local currencies in the current quarter.\nGovernment incentives and interest income totalling $3.6 million resulted in a net $14.2\nmillion loss or $0.12 negative impact to EPS in the current quarter. This compares to a\nnet gain of $3 million or a $0.03 positive impact in EPS in the same quarter of last year.\nOur effective tax rate was 9.8% in the third quarter, resulting in tax expense of $4.6\nmillion. This compares to a rate of 12.6% or a tax expense of $6.5 million in the same\nquarter last year. Third quarter 2024 net income was $42.7 million, or $0.41 per diluted\nshare. This compares to third quarter 2023 net income of $44.9 million, or $0.43 per\ndiluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $84.4 million, or 13.7% of net sales,\ncompared with third quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $84.1 million, or 14.7% of net\nsales. Depreciation for the quarter was $25.8 million. The net capital spending for the\nquarter was $40.9 million. Our cash flow from operations in the third quarter of 2024\nwas $65.1 million for 10.6% of net sales. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the\nthird quarter of 2024 totaled $469.5 million. Our net debt divided by last 12 months\nEBITDA was 1.4x, below the low end of our targeted range of 1.5x to 2x.\nNow I will turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We project net sales for the fourth\nquarter of 2024 to be in the range of $610 million to $650 million, and non-GAAP\nearnings to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.50 for diluted share, which is inclusive of\noperating costs associated with starting up our Penang facility.\nThe EPS forecast is based on diluted share count of approximately 104 million shares,\nwhich includes the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other stock awards.\nWe expect SG&A expense to be about 9.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter, and R&D\nto be about 1.3% of net sales. We expect interest expense of approximately $12.1\nmillion and interest income of approximately $2.5 million. We estimate our effective tax\nrate will be between 10% and 14%.\nFurther, we expect to record depreciation of approximately $26.6 million, amortization of\nintangibles of approximately $9.2 million, Stock-based compensation expense of\napproximately $8.3 million, and non-cash interest expense of approximately $0.5\nmillion.\nFinally, I'd like to announce that we will be participating in the Stifel Midwest one-on-one\nConference in Chicago on November 7, the BofA Leveraged Finance Conference in\nBoca Raton on December 3, and the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation\nConference in Palm Beach on December 4.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'd like to open the line for questions.\nOperator?\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from William Stein with Truist\nSecurities. Your line is now open, sir.\nWilliam Stein\nAll right, great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats, on the good quarter and\noutlook. I first want to ask about this foreign exchange impact and make sure I\nunderstand this because, while we are accustomed to dealing with these things\nepisodically with companies, we haven't heard you guys talk about this in a meaningful\nway, at least not in my -- not in the recent past, not that I remember anyway. Can you\nremind us, is this the result of a hedge where I really should look at sort of the whole\nresult of the company with this FX impact? Or do I think about this as an unhedged sort\nof one-time effect that in a way to get the normalized result I sort of back it out? Can you\nmaybe just explain this for us a little bit?\nDaniel Boehle\nYes, it's the latter, Will. Thanks for the question. This is Dan. The -- it's unhedged. It's a\nnon-cash impact from unrealized translation effects on our balance sheet. So we have\nsignificant balance sheet balances in both Asia or China and Malaysia. The Malaysian\nobviously has increased year-over-year because we now have that building up. So and\nbecause of the third quarter change in a US. dollar interest rate we just had a significant\ndevaluation of the U.S. dollar versus those currencies. So it'd be the latter to your\nquestion.\nWilliam Stein\nSo operationally, it looks like the earnings feed was quite a bit stronger than the sort of\nnominal non-GAAP number. So I think I get that.\nDaniel Boehle\nYes.\nWilliam Stein\nOne -- yes, the other question I wanted to ask about that's been a meaningful issue with\nthe company is your execution in Penang. I recall in the last call there was a push out in\nthe timing to break-even and the influence of this -- the new building and the new -- well,\nfacility really on your P&L. Can you review with us what the effect on the Q3 result was\nfrom Penang? Was it as big of a drag as you expected or smaller, bigger? And then\nhow you anticipate that trending over the next several quarters?\nDaniel Boehle\nSure, Will. Yes, it's been pretty consistent the last couple of quarters at about 180 basis\npoints drag on our operating margins. So it's been consistent this quarter and last and\nwe expect the same level of drag in the fourth quarter. We'll start seeing significant\nrevenue ramp up in Q1 and Q2 and as we've said previously, we do expect now to\nreach break-even middle of next year.\nWilliam Stein\nAnd that's the note previously, correct? That was what you said last quarter?\nDaniel Boehle\nRight. That's what we said last quarter.\nThomas Edman\nYes. And that's exactly right, Will. This is Tom. I just wanted to comment to give you a\nlittle bit of additional color on how Penang is going. Pretty much as we spoke about it\nlast quarter, we are registering revenues. They're insignificant at this point. Next quarter,\nwe're expecting a buildup in those revenues. And as Dan said, into Q1 and Q2 of next\nyear, we should see a steepening of the revenue climb.\nFrom a qualification standpoint, really no change. We're making progress, steady\nprogress there as we go through audits and qualifications. So and customer interest\nremains very high in the facility given the opportunity to reinforce or to enforce supply\nchain resiliency, that interest is still there from the customer base. So really no shift in\nterms of the characterization of facility from that perspective.\nWilliam Stein\nJust one more if I can squeeze it in. The 180 bps drag today that then the facility gets to\nbreak-even by mid next year. Is -- what you are -- the way we should interpret that, does\nthat mean effectively holding all sequel a year from now margins will be 180 bps higher\nor does it not quite mean that because it's even at break-even it's still a drag?\nDaniel Boehle\nNo. At break-even that's -- you'd get that 180 back, so that's zero drag. And then but if\nyou look at -- so that's a quarterly headwind that I've been giving you the 180 basis\npoints. So you're still going to have two quarters of that headwind and then the second\nhalf of the year you'll get to zero and the third quarter you'll start seeing it get a little bit\nabove that.\nWe expect mid-single -- mid-teen operating margins in that business ultimately as we\nget to full ramp. So you'll see somewhere between zero in that number as we ramp up\nin the second half of the year. So for that, when you look at an annual basis, you're not\ngoing to get all of that back. It will be slightly still negative for the full year, next year\nslight drag. But by -- on a quarterly basis, you'll be back at -- you'll be at zero by the\nthird quarter.\nOperator\nAnd our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin\nYes. A question on the strength that you're seeing in the data center and computing\nsegment. Could you remind us what percentage of your revenue there now is from\nhyperscale customers and or AI related? And in the customer concentration there, like\nhow many like significant customers are there in that segment?\nThomas Edman\nSo, yes, about 85% of that data center computing end market at this point is related to\nprimarily the hyperscalers and of course the big driver there is Generative AI. So that's\nsignificantly up as you know Matt from where we were historically. The balance is\nprimarily in the semiconductor side building boards. From the standpoint of number of\ncustomers, we have steadily been improving in terms of the diversity of the customer\nmix there.\nIt's still if you start looking at hyperscalers and who's involved in terms of leadership in\nthat market, it's still you're still looking at really a world of four or five major customers.\nSo you're always going to have a relatively high concentration there versus some of our\nother end markets, but we are trying to work actively to extend our presence across that\nbase.\nMatthew Sheerin\nYes. And Tom, in terms of the visibility that you have, we cover several other suppliers\nthat do see quarter-to-quarter volatility there in terms of orders and you already talked\nabout seeing some push outs into Q4, which is why you raised your guide there. So\ncould you talk about like as you look into next year, do you have firm visibility into the\nfirst couple of quarters or more or less than that?\nThomas Edman\nYes. So the visibility for us certainly Q4 as we've guided and then Q1 looks solid as\nwell. Beyond that gets difficult to -- more difficult to forecast. So really at this point, the\nstrength looks like we're in solid shape Q4 and then into Q1 harder to project beyond\nthat. And obviously, the backdrop still looks very good in terms of capital expenditures\nand Generative AI, in terms of innovation that's occurring in that end market that would\ndrive demand significantly, Matt. But again, in terms of firm demand signals, we're really\nit goes through Q1.\nMatthew Sheerin\nAnd then and just a question regarding the expansion in Syracuse. In terms of the\ntimetable there, will there be any financial impact in terms of margins or anything next\nyear? Or is it really more of a fiscal '26 story in terms of when you're going to start to\nramp and that sort of thing?\nDaniel Boehle\nYes, that's mostly fiscal 2026. Next year very little P&L impact. And we'll be building the\nfacility next year, but won't really have it online until very late in the year. You'll start\nseeing a little bit of depreciation. That's really it. We'll be ramp up for that slowly.\nOperator\nAnd the next question comes from Michael Crawford with B. Riley Securities.\nMichael Crawford\nCan you talk about what impact, if any, you had at your advanced technology center in\nChippewa Falls where there was a fire in August? I think this was facility you got with\nyour i3 acquisition five years ago?\nThomas Edman\nSure, Mike. Yes. So actually, it was in our Chippewa Falls base facility, which is -- which\nwe've had since 2002, I guess it was. Adjacent or close by that facility, we built our\nadvanced technology center that was not impacted. It was just in our main building for\nprinted circuit board production. It was -- there was really no impact -- material impact at\nall. We were -- and if there was we would have announced it. The fire occurred I think\non a Sunday. We were back in production a day later. So no material impact\nwhatsoever.\nMichael Crawford\nOkay. Excellent. And then, I'm guessing given that auto remains weak that you didn't\nhave a lot of program lifetime value wins booked in the period. But if you have that\nnumber, that'd be appreciated. And then kind of your outlook for when we might expect\nsome revival in that end market vertical?\nThomas Edman\nSure. Yes. So you characterized it well. Market continues to be at this point in a state of\nflux particularly because of the situation in China, the innovation around EVs there, but\nthe fact that that EV market is largely a China OEM EV market. And so that has\ncertainly impacted the Western World OEM customer base and in turn the Tier 1s.\nSo as they've looked at new programs to let, they've been reluctant given that\nturbulence to let significant programs out. And those programs that have been let out or\nprograms that are relatively less interest in terms of technology requirements.\nSo where we are this last quarter, we won about $25 million in terms of program value,\nthat is certainly not where we'd like to be. I think year-to-date we're at about $106\nmillion. It is I think representative of a market that is dealing with a lot of turbulence and\na market that personally and, I think, I mentioned this last quarter, this is really the one\ncommercial market where we're not from a TTM expectation standpoint, we're not\nexpecting growth. I think, next year will be a challenging year as well.\nIf you look beyond that to our other commercial markets, we are seeing really turning\nthe corner even in a market such as networking, which is now being influenced by AI.\nGood to see that growth, good to see data center continuing to be significant and the\ninstrumentation portion of our medical, industrial, instrumentation end market also really\nstarting to pick up. So again, automotive is the one market where I'm at this point\nhesitant to say that we will see growth here in the near-term.\nMichael Crawford\nMaybe just one final question for me further this point. So I believe the program lifetime\nvalue wins in the last two years in automotive were $530 million and then $623 million\nso if it's something like $125 million this year and even next year, still those prior wins\nought to be programs that are going into production or do some of those prior wins now\nmaybe go into potentially lower volume production than might have been envisioned at\nthat time?\nThomas Edman\nYes. No, that's a great point. So the wins that we've had in the past few years, I think\nthere is you really have a full spectrum there. There are programs and our focus and\nwhere we pick up significant content particularly in the EV space. We're going to see\nthose programs most of those programs go into production, but a couple of things are\ngoing on, Mike.\nI think one is the ramp schedules less aggressive than they were and the other in some\ncases the date of production of record has slipped. So certainly, as customers\nrecalibrate based on what they're seeing out there in terms of potential demand, they\nare moving those programs around as well. But by far the majority of those programs\nwill go to production. It's just a question of at what scale they -- how quickly they ramp\nand the timing of that.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham &\nCompany.\nChris Grenga\nThis is Chris Grenga on for Jim. I guess my first would be, have you observed or do you\nanticipate any impact from the strikes that are going on in the commercial aerospace\nindustry at the moment?\nThomas Edman\nSo, great question. Just to start, if you look at our A&D revenue, so looking at a\nbusiness that's accounting for 46% of total company revenue, only about 5% of that tie\nto commercial aerospace. And so relatively, if you look at total company revenues less\nthan about 2% of total company. So not a huge exposure there. With that said, our\nprogram content tends to be heavier with the 787. The 787 has not been affected. It's\nbuilt in South Carolina. So that's good news.\nWhat we have seen overall, revenues this last quarter were down about approximately\n25% quarter-on-quarter. But if you look year-on-year, it's still up 10% year-on-year and\nthat represents that continued 787 build, as well as in other areas the anticipation, I\nthink that the strike may not go on for too much longer. So we'll see what happens\nthere. But again, that's the extent of our visibility relatively insignificant part of company\nrevenue.\nChris Grenga\nAnd just to clarify the CapEx for the Syracuse expansion, the number -- the figure you\ncited, the $100 million to $130 million range, that's net of the federal and state\ncontributions?\nThomas Edman\nNo, that does not include that federal $30 million contribution. So that's pre that\ncontribution.\nOperator\nI am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over\nto Tom Edman for closing remarks.\nThomas Edman\nThank you very much. Just wanted to reiterate a few of the points that we made in the\ncall. First, we delivered strong operating margin performance that was driven by higher\nrevenues, favorable mix. And I really wanted to highlight the improved and ongoing\nimprovement in operational execution.\nSecond, we generated a healthy cash flow from operations at $65.1 million. We also\nmaintained a solid balance sheet with a net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.4x.\nThird, we continue to make progress on strategic initiatives such as our new facilities in\nPenang, and in Syracuse.\nAnd in closing, I would like to thank our employees, first and foremost our customers\nand our investors for all of your continued support. Thank you very much. Goodbye.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now\ndisconnect."

These statements reflect the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of the management of TTM, and we beli e ve s u c h statements to have a reasonable basis.\nIt is uncertain whether any of the events anticipated by the forward - looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of th em do, what impact they will have on the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.

Fa ctors,\nrisks, trends, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or i mpli ed in forward - looking statements include, but are not limited to potential changes in domestic or global economic conditions, d emand for our\nproducts, market pressures on prices of our products, warranty claims, changes in product mix, contemplated significant capit al expenditures and related financing requirements, our dependence upon a small number of customers, and other factors set forth in the\nCompany’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10 - K and Quarterly Report on Form 10 - Q and in the Company’s other filings filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under the heading “Risk Factors”, and which are available at th e\nSEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nTTM does not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements to reflect any new information, subsequent events or cir cumstances, or otherwise, except as may be required by law, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any proje cte d\nresults expressed in this communication or future communications to stockholders, press releases or Company statements will n ot be realized. In addition, the inclusion of any statement in this communication does not constitute an admission by us that th e e vents or\ncircumstances described in such statement are material.\nUse of Non- G AAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), TTM uses certain non - GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non - GAAP Operating Income, Non - GAAP Net\nIncome, Non- GAAP Operating Margin, Non - GAAP Gross Margin , Non - GAAP EPS and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow. We present non - GAAP fi nancial information to enable investors to see TTM through the eyes of management and to provide better insight into\nour ongoing financial performance.\nA material limitation associated with the use of the above non - GAAP financial measures is that they have no standardized measure ment prescribed by GAAP and may not be comparable to similar non - GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We\ncompensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of each non - GAAP financial measure and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. However, the non - GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or\nas a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nSee Appendix for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA and Non- GAAP Operating Income to the most comparable GAAP metric.\nData Used in This Presentation\nDue to rounding, numbers presented throughout this and other documents may not add up precisely to the totals provided and pe rce ntages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\nThird Party Information\nThe information contained herein does not purport to be all inclusive.

G AAP net income and non - G AAP EPS, which are non - G AAP financial measures. Management believes tha t both measures - - which add back amortization of\nintangibles, stock- based compensation expense, non- cash interest expense on debt (before consideration of capitalized interest), gain on sale of property, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on\nsale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inventory markup, restructuring, ac qui sition- related costs, and other charges as well as the associated\ntax impact of these charges and discrete tax items --provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company'songoing financial condition and results of operations.\n5 Income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a non -GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP ta x rate.\n6\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before income taxes, interest expense, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, stock - ba sed compensation expense, gain on sale of property, loss on\nextinguishment of debt, gain on sale of subsidiary, unrealized (gain) loss on commodity hedge, purchase accounting related inv ent ory markup, restructuring, acquisition- related costs, and other\ncharges. We present adjusted EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our operating results, and it is a key measure we use to eval uate our operations. In addition, we provide our adjusted\nEBITDA because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure for evaluati ng our operating performance and comparing our operating\nperformance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our futu re debt service, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements.\nHowever, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of li qui dity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating\nresults in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n12"
