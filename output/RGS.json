Matthew Doctor, Regis Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Our results continue to reflect our efforts to stabilize the business, as well as the work we must do to drive future growth. I am excited by our operational and digital strategies aimed to ensure we are consistently delivering superior convenience, service, and quality to our guests. By getting back to basics and delivering on this experience, we have a clear path to drive guests to our salons and ensure they keep coming back. Much work remains, but I believe strongly in the initiatives we have in place to return Regis to long-term, sustainable growth.\"  **_Financial Highlights:_** **First quarter fiscal 2025 compared to first quarter fiscal 2024:**\n\n  * Consolidated revenue of $46.1 million versus $53.4 million; driven by lower store count and same-store sales \n  * Same-store-sales decreased 1.1% versus the prior year \n  * Net loss of $0.9 million versus net income of $1.2 million in prior year; Diluted EPS of ($0.36) vs. $0.51 in the prior year; Q1 2025 net loss and EPS impacted by one-time items, including but not limited to $2.3 million severance accrual from August re-organization in addition to $1.1 million stock-based compensation adjustment due to stock price movement \n  * Adjusted net income of $2.6 million versus $1.7 million in prior year; Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.93 versus $0.71 in prior year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million versus $8.1 million in prior year; 40% Adjusted EBITDA margin vs. 38% margin in prior year; margin based on royalty, franchise fee and company-owned salon revenue \n\n|  **First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Results**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nConsolidated revenue  |  $  |  46.1  |  $  |  53.4   \nSystem-wide revenue (1)  |  285.6  |  306.6   \nSystem-wide same-store sales comps  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  1.8  |  %   \nOperating income  |  $  |  2.1  |  $  |  7.4   \n(Loss) income from continuing operations  |  (1.8  |  )  |  1.2   \nDiluted (loss) income per share from continuing operations  |  (0.77  |  )  |  0.51   \nIncome from discontinued operations  |  1.0  |  -   \nNet (loss) income  |  (0.9  |  )  |  1.2   \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share  |  (0.36  |  )  |  0.51   \nAdjusted Operating income  |  6.5  |  7.9   \nAdjusted EBITDA (2)  |  7.6  |  8.1   \nAdjusted Net income  |  2.6  |  1.7   \nAdjusted Diluted earnings per share  |  0.93  |  0.71   \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Represents total sales within the system.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\"   \n  \n**_Consolidated Revenue_**\n\nTotal consolidated revenue of $46.1 million in the first quarter 2025 declined $7.3 million. The decline was driven primarily by a reduction in non-margin franchise rental income and advertising fund contributions and the wind down of loss-generating company-owned salons. \n\n**_Operating Income_**\n\nRegis reported first quarter 2025 operating income of $2.1 million, a decline of $5.3 million compared to $7.4 million in the first quarter 2024. The year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by increased severance costs of $2.3 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million for the first quarter 2025. \n\n**_(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations_**\n\nRegis reported first quarter 2025 net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million, or $0.77 loss per diluted share from continuing operations, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.2 million, or $0.51 diluted income per share from continuing operations, in the first quarter 2024. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by a decrease in operating income partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. \n\n**_Net (Loss) Income_**\n\nThe Company reported first quarter 2025 net loss of $0.9 million, or $0.36 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.51 income per diluted share, for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in the quarter was driven primarily by a decrease in operating income partially offset by a decrease in interest expense and income from discontinued operations. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million declined $0.5 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million in the same period last year. The decline is primarily related to lower royalties and a non-recurring benefit in the prior year, offset by sublease income. \n\n**First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Segment Results**  \n---  \n**Franchise**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Decrease**  \n(Dollars in millions) (1)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRoyalties  |  $  |  15.6  |  $  |  16.5  |  $  |  (0.9  |  )   \nFees  |  2.4  |  2.6  |  (0.2  |  )   \nProduct sales to franchisees  |  -  |  0.4  |  (0.4  |  )   \nAdvertising fund contributions  |  5.6  |  7.2  |  (1.6  |  )   \nFranchise rental income  |  21.6  |  24.7  |  (3.1  |  )   \nTotal franchise revenue  |  $  |  45.3  |  $  |  51.4  |  $  |  (6.1  |  )   \nFranchise same-store sales comps  |  (1.2  |  )%  |  1.7  |  %   \nFranchise adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  8.0  |  $  |  8.6  |  $  |  (0.6  |  )   \n_as a percent of revenue_ |  _17.6_ |  _%_ |  _16.7_ |  _%_  \n_as a percent of adjusted revenue (2)_ |  _44.4_ |  _%_ |  _44.0_ |  _%_  \nTotal franchise salons  |  4,350  |  4,745  |  (395  |  )   \n_as a percent of total franchise and company-owned salons_ |  _99.8_ |  _%_ |  _98.6_ |  _%_  \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not recalculate due to rounding.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Adjusted revenue excludes non-margin revenue. See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\"   \n  \n**_Franchise Revenue_**\n\nFirst quarter franchise revenue was $45.3 million, a $6.1 million, or 11.9%, decrease compared to the prior year quarter. Non-margin franchise rental income was the primary driver of the decline due to fewer franchise salons in the current year and franchisees renewing their own leases. \n\nRoyalties were $15.6 million, a $0.9 million, or 5.5%, decrease for the first quarter 2025, versus the same period last year due to fewer franchise salons and negative same-store sales. \n\n**_Franchise Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter franchise adjusted EBITDA of $8.0 million declined $0.6 million, The decline is primarily related to lower royalties and a non-recurring benefit in the prior year, offset by sublease income. \n\n**Company-Owned Salons**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Increase (Decrease)**  \n(Dollars in millions) (1)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nTotal company-owned salon revenue  |  $  |  0.8  |  $  |  1.9  |  $  |  (1.1  |  )   \nCompany-owned salon adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  (0.3  |  )  |  $  |  (0.5  |  )  |  $  |  0.2   \n_as a percent of revenue_ |  _(37.5_ |  _)%_ |  _(26.3_ |  _)%_  \nTotal company-owned salons  |  9  |  66  |  (57  |  )   \n_as a percent of total franchise and company-owned salons_ |  _0.2_ |  _%_ |  _1.4_ |  _%_  \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Company-Owned Salon Revenue_**\n\nFirst quarter revenue for the company-owned salon segment declined $1.1 million versus the prior year to $0.8 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue was expected and driven by the closure of 47 loss generating company-owned salons over the past twelve months. \n\n**_Company-Owned Salon Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter company-owned salon adjusted EBITDA improved $0.2 million year-over-year, due primarily to the wind-down of under performing company-owned salons. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 with $6.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $110.4 million in outstanding borrowings and available total liquidity of $11.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $1.3 million, an improvement of $1.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower operating costs. Cash provided by investing activities includes $957 thousand of proceeds related to salons migrating to the Zenoti platform. \n\n**Non-GAAP Reconciliations**\n\nFor GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please refer to the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\" A complete reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings is included in this press release and is available on the Company's website at [www.regiscorp.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regiscorp.com&esheet=54147619&newsitemid=20241106247461&lan=en-US&anchor=www.regiscorp.com&index=1&md5=0116428eca808ceef06f7d7ff5ac3048). \n\n**Earnings Webcast**\n\nRegis Corporation will host a conference call via webcast discussing first quarter results today, November 6, 2024, at 7:30 a.m. Central time.

The non-GAAP measures are financial measures that do not reflect United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We believe our presentation of the non-GAAP measures provides meaningful insight into our ongoing operating performance and a supplemental perspective of our results of operations. Presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows investors to review our core ongoing operating performance from the same perspective as management and the Board of Directors. These non-GAAP financial measures provide investors an enhanced understanding of our operations, facilitate investors' analyses and comparisons of our current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of our future performance. We also believe the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information that research analysts frequently use to analyze financial performance. \n\nItems impacting comparability are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine the items to consider as \"items impacting comparability\" based on how management views our business, makes financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. \n\nThe following items have been excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA results: stock-based compensation expense, discontinued operations, one-time professional fees and legal settlements, severance expense, excess inventory impairment charges, the benefit from lease liability decreases in excess of previously impaired right of use asset, lease termination fees and asset retirement obligation costs. \n\nWe present adjusted revenue to provide a meaningful franchise adjusted EBITDA margin, which removes non-margin revenue from total revenue to arrive at an adjusted margin. Margin is a common metric used by investors, however, the majority of our revenue is offset by equal expense, so it does not contribute to our margin. We remove the non-margin revenue from this metric in order to show a meaningful margin rate. \n\nThe method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP results should not be regarded as a substitute for corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of operating performance in evaluating our business. Non-GAAP measures do have limitations as they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be viewed in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\n**REGIS CORPORATION** **Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA** **(Dollars in thousands)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nReported net (loss) income  |  $  |  (853  |  )  |  $  |  1,194   \nInterest expense  |  4,846  |  6,188   \nIncome tax benefit  |  (225  |  )  |  (148  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  446  |  370   \nLong lived asset impairment  |  352  |  -   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  4,566  |  $  |  7,604   \nStock-based compensation expense (1)  |  1,430  |  630   \nGain on discontinued operations  |  (957  |  )  |  -   \nDiscrete items (2)  |  2,597  |  (141  |  )   \nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure  |  $  |  7,636  |  $  |  8,093   \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Beginning in fiscal year 2025, management made the determination to exclude stock-based compensation expenses from the adjusted EBITDA calculation.

Matthew Doctor, Regis Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Our results continue to reflect our efforts to stabilize the business, as well as the work we must do to drive future growth. I am excited by our operational and digital strategies aimed to ensure we are consistently delivering superior convenience, service, and quality to our guests. By getting back to basics and delivering on this experience, we have a clear path to drive guests to our salons and ensure they keep coming back. Much work remains, but I believe strongly in the initiatives we have in place to return Regis to long-term, sustainable growth.\"  **_Financial Highlights:_** **First quarter fiscal 2025 compared to first quarter fiscal 2024:**\n\n  * Consolidated revenue of $46.1 million versus $53.4 million; driven by lower store count and same-store sales \n  * Same-store-sales decreased 1.1% versus the prior year \n  * Net loss of $0.9 million versus net income of $1.2 million in prior year; Diluted EPS of ($0.36) vs. $0.51 in the prior year; Q1 2025 net loss and EPS impacted by one-time items, including but not limited to $2.3 million severance accrual from August re-organization in addition to $1.1 million stock-based compensation adjustment due to stock price movement \n  * Adjusted net income of $2.6 million versus $1.7 million in prior year; Adjusted Diluted EPS of $0.93 versus $0.71 in prior year \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million versus $8.1 million in prior year; 40% Adjusted EBITDA margin vs. 38% margin in prior year; margin based on royalty, franchise fee and company-owned salon revenue \n\n|  **First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Consolidated Results**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nConsolidated revenue  |  $  |  46.1  |  $  |  53.4   \nSystem-wide revenue (1)  |  285.6  |  306.6   \nSystem-wide same-store sales comps  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  1.8  |  %   \nOperating income  |  $  |  2.1  |  $  |  7.4   \n(Loss) income from continuing operations  |  (1.8  |  )  |  1.2   \nDiluted (loss) income per share from continuing operations  |  (0.77  |  )  |  0.51   \nIncome from discontinued operations  |  1.0  |  -   \nNet (loss) income  |  (0.9  |  )  |  1.2   \nDiluted (loss) earnings per share  |  (0.36  |  )  |  0.51   \nAdjusted Operating income  |  6.5  |  7.9   \nAdjusted EBITDA (2)  |  7.6  |  8.1   \nAdjusted Net income  |  2.6  |  1.7   \nAdjusted Diluted earnings per share  |  0.93  |  0.71   \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Represents total sales within the system.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\"   \n  \n**_Consolidated Revenue_**\n\nTotal consolidated revenue of $46.1 million in the first quarter 2025 declined $7.3 million. The decline was driven primarily by a reduction in non-margin franchise rental income and advertising fund contributions and the wind down of loss-generating company-owned salons. \n\n**_Operating Income_**\n\nRegis reported first quarter 2025 operating income of $2.1 million, a decline of $5.3 million compared to $7.4 million in the first quarter 2024. The year-over-year decline in operating income was driven primarily by increased severance costs of $2.3 million and stock-based compensation expense of $1.4 million for the first quarter 2025. \n\n**_(Loss) Income from Continuing Operations_**\n\nRegis reported first quarter 2025 net loss from continuing operations of $1.8 million, or $0.77 loss per diluted share from continuing operations, compared to net income from continuing operations of $1.2 million, or $0.51 diluted income per share from continuing operations, in the first quarter 2024. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by a decrease in operating income partially offset by a decrease in interest expense. \n\n**_Net (Loss) Income_**\n\nThe Company reported first quarter 2025 net loss of $0.9 million, or $0.36 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.51 income per diluted share, for the same period last year. The year-over-year decline in the quarter was driven primarily by a decrease in operating income partially offset by a decrease in interest expense and income from discontinued operations. \n\n**_Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA of $7.6 million declined $0.5 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million in the same period last year. The decline is primarily related to lower royalties and a non-recurring benefit in the prior year, offset by sublease income. \n\n**First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Segment Results**  \n---  \n**Franchise**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Decrease**  \n(Dollars in millions) (1)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nRoyalties  |  $  |  15.6  |  $  |  16.5  |  $  |  (0.9  |  )   \nFees  |  2.4  |  2.6  |  (0.2  |  )   \nProduct sales to franchisees  |  -  |  0.4  |  (0.4  |  )   \nAdvertising fund contributions  |  5.6  |  7.2  |  (1.6  |  )   \nFranchise rental income  |  21.6  |  24.7  |  (3.1  |  )   \nTotal franchise revenue  |  $  |  45.3  |  $  |  51.4  |  $  |  (6.1  |  )   \nFranchise same-store sales comps  |  (1.2  |  )%  |  1.7  |  %   \nFranchise adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  8.0  |  $  |  8.6  |  $  |  (0.6  |  )   \n_as a percent of revenue_ |  _17.6_ |  _%_ |  _16.7_ |  _%_  \n_as a percent of adjusted revenue (2)_ |  _44.4_ |  _%_ |  _44.0_ |  _%_  \nTotal franchise salons  |  4,350  |  4,745  |  (395  |  )   \n_as a percent of total franchise and company-owned salons_ |  _99.8_ |  _%_ |  _98.6_ |  _%_  \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not recalculate due to rounding.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Adjusted revenue excludes non-margin revenue. See GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\"   \n  \n**_Franchise Revenue_**\n\nFirst quarter franchise revenue was $45.3 million, a $6.1 million, or 11.9%, decrease compared to the prior year quarter. Non-margin franchise rental income was the primary driver of the decline due to fewer franchise salons in the current year and franchisees renewing their own leases. \n\nRoyalties were $15.6 million, a $0.9 million, or 5.5%, decrease for the first quarter 2025, versus the same period last year due to fewer franchise salons and negative same-store sales. \n\n**_Franchise Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter franchise adjusted EBITDA of $8.0 million declined $0.6 million, The decline is primarily related to lower royalties and a non-recurring benefit in the prior year, offset by sublease income. \n\n**Company-Owned Salons**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Increase (Decrease)**  \n(Dollars in millions) (1)  |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nTotal company-owned salon revenue  |  $  |  0.8  |  $  |  1.9  |  $  |  (1.1  |  )   \nCompany-owned salon adjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  (0.3  |  )  |  $  |  (0.5  |  )  |  $  |  0.2   \n_as a percent of revenue_ |  _(37.5_ |  _)%_ |  _(26.3_ |  _)%_  \nTotal company-owned salons  |  9  |  66  |  (57  |  )   \n_as a percent of total franchise and company-owned salons_ |  _0.2_ |  _%_ |  _1.4_ |  _%_  \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Variances calculated on amounts shown in millions may result in rounding differences.   \n---|---  \n  \n**_Company-Owned Salon Revenue_**\n\nFirst quarter revenue for the company-owned salon segment declined $1.1 million versus the prior year to $0.8 million. The year-over-year decline in revenue was expected and driven by the closure of 47 loss generating company-owned salons over the past twelve months. \n\n**_Company-Owned Salon Adjusted EBITDA_**\n\nFirst quarter company-owned salon adjusted EBITDA improved $0.2 million year-over-year, due primarily to the wind-down of under performing company-owned salons. \n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow**\n\nThe Company ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 with $6.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, $110.4 million in outstanding borrowings and available total liquidity of $11.9 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, totaled $1.3 million, an improvement of $1.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower operating costs. Cash provided by investing activities includes $957 thousand of proceeds related to salons migrating to the Zenoti platform. \n\n**Non-GAAP Reconciliations**\n\nFor GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please refer to the attached section titled \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations.\" A complete reconciliation of reported earnings to adjusted earnings is included in this press release and is available on the Company's website at [www.regiscorp.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regiscorp.com&esheet=54147619&newsitemid=20241106247461&lan=en-US&anchor=www.regiscorp.com&index=1&md5=0116428eca808ceef06f7d7ff5ac3048). \n\n**Earnings Webcast**\n\nRegis Corporation will host a conference call via webcast discussing first quarter results today, November 6, 2024, at 7:30 a.m. Central time.

The non-GAAP measures are financial measures that do not reflect United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We believe our presentation of the non-GAAP measures provides meaningful insight into our ongoing operating performance and a supplemental perspective of our results of operations. Presentation of the non-GAAP measures allows investors to review our core ongoing operating performance from the same perspective as management and the Board of Directors. These non-GAAP financial measures provide investors an enhanced understanding of our operations, facilitate investors' analyses and comparisons of our current and past results of operations and provide insight into the prospects of our future performance. We also believe the non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide supplemental information that research analysts frequently use to analyze financial performance. \n\nItems impacting comparability are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine the items to consider as \"items impacting comparability\" based on how management views our business, makes financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance. \n\nThe following items have been excluded from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA results: stock-based compensation expense, discontinued operations, one-time professional fees and legal settlements, severance expense, excess inventory impairment charges, the benefit from lease liability decreases in excess of previously impaired right of use asset, lease termination fees and asset retirement obligation costs. \n\nWe present adjusted revenue to provide a meaningful franchise adjusted EBITDA margin, which removes non-margin revenue from total revenue to arrive at an adjusted margin. Margin is a common metric used by investors, however, the majority of our revenue is offset by equal expense, so it does not contribute to our margin. We remove the non-margin revenue from this metric in order to show a meaningful margin rate. \n\nThe method we use to produce non-GAAP results is not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from methods used by other companies. These non-GAAP results should not be regarded as a substitute for corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, but instead should be utilized as a supplemental measure of operating performance in evaluating our business. Non-GAAP measures do have limitations as they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be viewed in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \n\n**REGIS CORPORATION** **Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA** **(Dollars in thousands)** **(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \nReported net (loss) income  |  $  |  (853  |  )  |  $  |  1,194   \nInterest expense  |  4,846  |  6,188   \nIncome tax benefit  |  (225  |  )  |  (148  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  446  |  370   \nLong lived asset impairment  |  352  |  -   \nEBITDA  |  $  |  4,566  |  $  |  7,604   \nStock-based compensation expense (1)  |  1,430  |  630   \nGain on discontinued operations  |  (957  |  )  |  -   \nDiscrete items (2)  |  2,597  |  (141  |  )   \nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measure  |  $  |  7,636  |  $  |  8,093   \n  \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n\n(1)  |  Beginning in fiscal year 2025, management made the determination to exclude stock-based compensation expenses from the adjusted EBITDA calculation.

Business\nGeneral:\nRegis Corporation franchises and owns hair care salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol \"RGS.\"\nUnless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" or \"us,\" we are referring to Regis\nCorporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company franchised or owned 4,863 locations, primarily in North America. The Company's locations\nconsist of 4,795 franchised salons and 68 company-owned salons. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar\nsalon products and services.\nThe major services supplied by the salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning) and hair\ncoloring. Salons also sell a variety of hair care and other beauty products. We earn royalty revenue based on service and\nproduct sales at our franchise locations and earn revenue for services and products sold at our company-owned salons. Salons\noperate primarily under the trade names of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Roosters and they\ngenerally serve the value category within the industry. Salons are primarily located in strip center locations and Walmart\nSupercenters.\nFinancial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 are included in Note 15 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nAs of June 30, 2023, 98.6% of our salons are owned by franchisees. The remaining 68 company-owned salons will be sold or\nclosed when the related leases expire or terminate.\nIndustry Overview:\nThe hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently-owned and operated. In nearly\nevery area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar\nprices. The Company faces competition from chains, such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, Sport Clips and Ulta Beauty,\nindependently-owned salons, in-home hair services, booth rentals and blow dry bars. The Company also faces competition from\nother franchise organizations outside of the hair salon industry in attracting new franchisees.\nAt the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to\nestablish systems and infrastructure, the ability to recruit franchisees, experienced field and salon management and stylists, and\nto lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality and consistency of the guest\nexperience, the ability to attract, retain, and train stylists, technology, convenience, location and price. The Company\ncontinually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of brand differentiation\nversus the competition.\n4\nTable of Contents\nSalon Franchising Program:\nGeneral. We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval,\nprofessional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of ongoing support designed to help franchisees\nbuild successful businesses. Historically, we have signed the salon lease and then subleased the space to our franchisees.\nHowever, moving forward, for new locations and some lease renewals, we will seek for franchisees to sign the salon leases\ndirectly with the landlords. We have the right to approve salon leases. The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square\nfeet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet.\nStandards of Operations. The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment,\nbenefits and wage determination, prices charged for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital\nexpenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve\nlocations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established\noperational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design, and decor and trademark usage. The\nCompany's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the\nstandards for each franchising program. All the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the\nCompany to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control day-to-day franchise operations or make decisions that\nhave a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company's franchise agreements do not give the\nCompany any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of\nfranchisees' employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor\nand trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees' employees' wages and benefits, hours of work, scheduling,\nleave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute\nresolution procedures, and/or discipline and discharge.\nFranchise Terms. Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and\nongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most brands, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and\nadministers the funds on behalf of the brands. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture,\nfixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of\nfranchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the\nCompany's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location.\nAdditional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below:\nSupercuts\nSupercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination\nof the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements,\nwhich give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific.\nThe development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements.\nOlder franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights, which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements\nand provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that\nresolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store\nsites.\nSmartStyle and Cost Cutters in Walmart Supercenters\nThe majority of existing SmartStyle and Cost Cutters franchise agreements for salons located in Walmart Supercenters have a\nfive-year term with a five-year option to renew. The franchise agreements are site specific.\nCost Cutters (not located in Walmart Supercenters), First Choice Haircutters and Magicuts\nThe majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15-year term with a 15-year option to renew (at the option of\nthe franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a 10-year term with a five-year option\nto renew. The majority of Magicuts franchise agreements have a term equal to the greater of five years or the current initial term\nof the lease agreement with an option to renew for two additional five-year periods. The current franchise agreement is site\nspecific. Franchisees may enter into development agreements with the Company, which provide limited territorial protection.\nRoosters Men’s Grooming Center\nRoosters franchise agreements have a 10-year term with a 10-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee). New\nfranchisees enter into a franchise agreement concurrent with the opening of their first store, along with a development\nagreement with the right to open two additional locations.\n5\nTable of Contents\nFranchisee Training. The Company provides new franchisees with training, focusing on the various aspects of salon\nmanagement, including operations, management training, marketing fundamentals and controls. Existing franchisees receive\ntraining, counseling and information from the Company on a regular basis. The Company provides franchise salon managers\nand stylists with access to technical training resources.\nGuests\nAmong other factors, consistent delivery of an exceptional guest experience, haircut quality, convenience, competitive pricing,\nsalon location, inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, comprehensive retail assortments, and engagement through\ntechnology all drive guest traffic and improve guest retention.\nGuest Experience. Our portfolio of salon concepts enables our guests to select different service scheduling options based\nupon their preference. We believe the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times are essential\nelements in delivering an efficient guest experience. Our mobile applications and online check-in capabilities, including check-\nins directly from Google®, allow us to capitalize on our guests' desire for convenience. Our franchisees continue to focus on\nstylist staffing and retention, optimizing schedules, balancing variable labor hours with guest traffic, and managing guest wait\ntimes. Our franchise salons are located in high-traffic strip centers and Walmart Supercenters, with guest parking and easy\naccess, and are generally open seven days per week to offer guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs.\nStylists. Our Company depends on the stylists in our system to help deliver great guest experiences. We believe in the\nimportance of the ongoing development of stylists' craft. We aim to be an industry leader in stylist training, including the\nutilization of both live and digital training. We believe stylists deliver a superior experience for guests when they are well-\ntrained technically and through years of experience. We employ trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the\nCompany and train franchisee trainers. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers that\nbring specialized expertise to stylists in our system. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate\nthe operation of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions.\nAffordability. The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect\noutstanding service at competitive prices. These expectations are met with the average service price of transactions ranging\nfrom $24 to $30. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon-level basis and are established based on local conditions. Our\nfranchisees control all pricing at their locations.\nRetail Assortments. Salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as an assortment of company-\nowned brand products. Stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests.\nAdditionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of\nour guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include: L'Oreal Professional Brands, Regis\nPrivate Label Brand, Designline®, and Paul Mitchell. We also distribute our Designline brand through distribution channels,\nincluding Amazon.com and Walmart.com.\nMarketing. Our marketing is brand specific and funded primarily from contractual contributions, based on sales, to the\nbrand's cooperative advertising funds. These funds are used largely in support of advertising and other efforts to increase guest\ntraffic to our salons, grow online booking usage, and improve overall awareness of and affinity for our brands. A portion of our\nmarketing funds are used in support of stylist recruitment and training to grow the number of active stylists in our system.\nTechnology. In fiscal year 2022, we sold our proprietary back-office salon management system, Opensalon® Pro to a third\nparty, Soham Inc. (Zenoti). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. We\nexpect all our salons will transition to the Zenoti salon technology platform. We also use mobile applications to allow guests to\nview wait times and interact in other ways with salons.\nSalon Support. Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. We take a service-oriented mentality to best\nsupport our franchisees and oversee our remaining company-owned locations. Salon Support and our associated priorities are\naligned with our brands to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service we provide. Salon Support is primarily\nlocated in Minneapolis, Minnesota while allowing for hybrid and remote work.\n6\nTable of Contents\nSalon Concepts:\nThe Company's salon concepts focus on providing high-quality hair care services and professional hair care products.\nDescriptions of the Company's salon concepts are listed below:\nSupercuts.

The Company has 102 franchised international locations.\nThe tables below set forth the number of system-wide locations (Franchised and Company-owned) and activity within the\nvarious salon concepts.\nSystem-wide location counts\nJune 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nFRANCHISE SALONS:\nSupercuts 2,082 2,264 2,386\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores 1,388 1,646 1,666\nPortfolio Brands 1,223 1,344 1,357\nTotal North American salons 4,693 5,254 5,409\nTotal International salons (1) 102 141 154\nTotal Franchise salons 4,795 5,395 5,563\nas a percent of total Franchise and Company-owned salons 98.6 % 98.1 % 95.3 %\nCOMPANY-OWNED SALONS:\nSupercuts 7 18 35\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores 48 49 91\nPortfolio Brands 13 38 150\nTotal Company-owned salons 68 105 276\nas a percent of total Franchise and Company-owned salons 1.4 % 1.9 % 4.7 %\nTotal Franchise and Company-owned salons 4,863 5,500 5,839\n7\nTable of Contents\nConstructed locations (net relocations)\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nFRANCHISE SALONS:\nSupercuts 11 15 21\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores — 1 —\nPortfolio Brands 4 5 10\nTotal North American salons 15 21 31\nTotal International salons (1) — — 1\nTotal Franchise salons 15 21 32\nCOMPANY-OWNED SALONS:\nSupercuts — — 4\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores — — —\nPortfolio Brands 1 — —\nTotal Company-owned salons 1 — 4\nClosed locations\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nFRANCHISE SALONS:\nSupercuts (196) (156) (273)\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores (258) (49) (56)\nPortfolio Brands (123) (81) (82)\nTotal North American salons (577) (286) (411)\nTotal International salons (1) (39) (13) (14)\nTotal Franchise salons (616) (299) (425)\nCOMPANY-OWNED SALONS:\nSupercuts (11) (6) (54)\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores (1) (15) (252)\nPortfolio Brands (25) (40) (307)\nTotal Company-owned salons (37) (61) (613)\n8\nTable of Contents\nConversions (including net franchisee transactions) (2)\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nFRANCHISE SALONS:\nSupercuts 3 19 130\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores — 28 405\nPortfolio Brands (2) 63 212\nTotal Franchise salons 1 110 747\nCOMPANY-OWNED SALONS:\nSupercuts — (11) (125)\nSmartStyle/Cost Cutters in Walmart stores — (27) (408)\nPortfolio Brands (1) (72) (214)\nTotal Company-owned salons (1) (110) (747)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Canadian and Puerto Rican salons are included in the North American salon totals.\n(2) During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company acquired 0, 0 and 1 salon locations, respectively, from\nfranchisees.

(EEG), which is\naccounted for as an equity method investment. EEG operates accredited cosmetology schools. We entered into an agreement to\nsell our stake in EEG to the controlling owner in fiscal year 2020, the closing of which is pending state approvals. The sale is\nnot expected to have a significant impact on the Company's operations or financial position.\nCorporate Trademarks:\nThe Company holds numerous trademarks, both in the United States and in many foreign countries. The most recognized\ntrademarks are \"SmartStyle®,\" \"Supercuts®,\" \"Regis Salons®,\" \"Cost Cutters®,\" \"First Choice Haircutters®,\" \"Roosters®\" and\n\"Magicuts®.\"\nHuman Capital Management:\nOur Culture\nWe are committed to our purpose of Unleashing the Beauty of Potential, which is supported by our four core values:\nFoster Trust. Create powerful relationships by acting with empathy and integrity.\nCreate Community. Connect and collaborate with all your partners. Share the challenges as much as you celebrate the wins.\nBe Brave. Dream big and courageously challenge the status quo.\nOwn It. You are empowered. Take responsibility and own your role and your results.\nThese values support a collaborative and inclusive culture that is critical to the success and growth of our Company. To help\nreinforce our values and incorporate them into everything we do, we have a values committee comprised of cultural\nambassadors who serve as the voice of employees and help ensure a best-in-class employee experience.\nOur People\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company employed 435 employees. The Company offers flexible work arrangements such as hybrid\nand remote work.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe Company promotes diversity of thoughts, backgrounds, experiences, and ideas. As of June 30, 2023, 86% of the\nCompany's entire workforce are women and 14% are men. Additionally, 68% of the Company's leadership positions are held by\nwomen.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFamilies First\nOver one hundred years ago, the Company began as a family business and its support of families continues today. It offers up to\n16 weeks of parental leave, including adoption, up to 12 of which are paid, so that parents have time to focus on their newest\nfamily members. It also offers flexible work arrangements, including full-time telecommuting. Additionally, the Company\noffers flexible paid time off, which allows employees to control their time away from work based on individual needs, not years\nof service.\nOther Compensation and Benefits\nThe Company also takes care of its people by offering competitive compensation and benefits packages that are designed to\nsupport the total well-being and promote the full potential of our employees and their families. These include short- and long-\nterm incentive packages, an employee stock purchase plan, retirement plans, health, dental, and vision benefits, basic life\ninsurance, long-term disability coverage, and wellness and employee assistance programs. The Company analyzes market\ntrends and monitors its own compensation practices to attract, retain, and promote employees and reduce turnover and\nassociated costs. In addition, its short- and long-term incentive plans are aligned with its core values and key business\nobjectives, which are intended to motivate strong performance.\nDevelopment and Engagement\nContinuous employee development and engagement are essential to creating a high-performance culture. In fiscal years 2023\nand 2022, we increased our investment in learning and development. In addition to the resources available on our internal\nLearning Hub, we launched our Beauty of Series, which consists of interactive sessions designed to help our employees unleash\ntheir potential.\nWe surveyed our employees to provide them with an opportunity to share anonymous feedback with management in a variety\nof areas, including support from leadership, communication and collaboration, growth and career opportunities, available\nresources, and recognition. Leaders reviewed the results to determine opportunities and develop action plans for their teams to\nimprove engagement and the overall employee experience. We introduced Regis Listens, which highlights offerings that we've\nimplemented as a result of employee feedback to show employees that we are listening.\nCorporate Responsibility\nThe Company will not do business with organizations that employ or condone unfair labor practices. Instead, it partners with\ncompanies who share its commitment to ethical business conduct and fair labor practices. The Company also specifically\ncondemns human trafficking and abuse of child labor.\n11\nTable of Contents\nGovernmental Regulations:\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of\nregulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty-related business, including health and safety. At the end of fiscal year\n2020, the majority of state and local governments where we operate temporarily mandated the closure of our salons in response\nto the COVID-19 global pandemic. These pandemic related government-mandated closures continued into fiscal year 2021 and\ninto fiscal year 2022 in parts of Canada. We monitor state and local regulations carefully to ensure the safety of our stylists and\nguests.\nIn the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule\non Franchising (the FTC Rule) and to state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise\noperations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of a disclosure document containing\nspecified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has\nregistered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and where\nregistration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisee/franchisor relationship presently exist in a substantial number of\nstates and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the\nfranchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees, and\nlimit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is\nfor government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not\nexpect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations.\nIn Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario,\nAlberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs\nby way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial\nfranchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship\nrequirements, such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees.\nThe Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all its\noperations.\nThe Company maintains an ownership interest in Empire Education Group, Inc. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of\ntheir revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education\nAct of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the schools, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility\nrequirements established by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell our\nownership interest in EEG to the other owner. The transaction is subject to state ownership transfer approvals.\nFinancial Information about Foreign and North American Operations\nFinancial information about foreign and North American operations is incorporated herein by reference to Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and segment information in\nNote 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company is subject to the informational requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange\nAct).

Risk Factors\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nChanges in consumer shopping trends and manufacturer choice of distribution channels may negatively affect both service\nand product revenues.\nOur salons are partly dependent on the volume of customer foot traffic around their locations to generate both service and\nproduct revenues. Because many of our salons are located in shopping centers, customer foot traffic may be adversely affected\nby changing consumer shopping trends that favor internet-based shopping or alternative shopping methods or locations.\nIn addition, we are experiencing a proliferation of alternative channels of distribution, such as blow dry bars, booth rental\nfacilities, discount brick-and-mortar and online professional product retailers, as well as manufacturers selling directly to\nconsumers online, all of which may negatively affect our product and service revenue. Also, product manufacturers may decide\nto utilize these other distribution channels to a larger extent than in the past and they generally have the right to terminate\nrelationships with us with little advance notice. These changes in distribution channels could also reduce the volume of foot\ntraffic around our salons, and in turn, our revenues may be adversely affected.\n14\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased\ncosts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and revenues.\nIn our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels can affect our business. Legal\nrequirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretations, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance\nwith these requirements or their effect on our operations. If we or our franchisees fail to comply with any present or future laws\nor regulations, we or they could be subject to future liabilities or a prohibition on the operation of salons.\nA number of U.S. states, Canadian provinces, and municipalities in which we do business have recently increased, or are\nconsidering increasing, the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the\nemployer. Increases in minimum wages, employment taxes and overtime pay result in an increase in salon operating costs, and\nthe salons' ability to offset these increases through price increases may be limited. In fact, increases in minimum wages have\nincreased salon operating costs over the last five years. In addition, a growing number of states, provinces and municipalities\nhave passed, or are considering passing, requirements for paid sick leave, family leave, predictive scheduling (which imposes\npenalties for changing an employee's shift as it nears), and other requirements that increase the administrative complexity and\ncost of managing a workforce. Increases in costs for our franchisees could lead to reduced profitability of salons, which may\nlead to salon closures. Finally, changes in labor laws designed to facilitate union organizing, could increase the likelihood of\nstylists being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of stylists were to become unionized, it\nwould have an adverse effect on salon operations which adversely impacts our business and financial results.\nIf the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) were to decide to treat our franchisees as \"joint employers\" with us or if our\nfranchisees are classified as large employers under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliations with us, this could have\nan adverse impact on our business. In addition, we and our franchisees must comply with state employment laws, including the\nCalifornia Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nVarious state and federal laws govern our relationships with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to\ncomply with these laws, we may subject the Company and our personnel to claims lodged by our franchisees, as well as federal\nand state government agencies, and those claims may include, among others, fraud, misrepresentation, unfair business practices\nand wrongful terminations. As a result of those claims, we could be liable for fines, damages, stop orders or other penalties. A\nfranchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under\nthe franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability or other\ntheories or liabilities. All such legal actions could not only result in changes to laws and interpretations, which could make it\nmore difficult to appropriately support our franchisees and, consequently, impact our performance, but could also result in\nexpensive litigation with our franchisees, third parties or government agencies, which could adversely affect both our profits\nand our important relationships with our franchisees. In addition, other regulatory or legal developments may result in changes\nto laws or to the franchisee/franchisor relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly,\nour profits.\nWe are also subject to federal statutes and regulations, including the rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,\nas well as certain state laws governing the offer and sale of franchises. Many state franchise laws impose substantive\nrequirements on franchise agreements, including limitations on non-competition provisions and on provisions concerning the\ntermination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that certain materials be filed for a franchisor to be registered\nand approved before franchises can be offered or sold in that state. The failure to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell\nfranchises could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition to employment and franchise laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws\nand regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those affecting public companies, product manufacturing and\nsale and those governing the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Compliance with new, complex, and changing laws may cause\nour expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product\nrecalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be responsible for Empire Education Group, Inc.'s liabilities.\nWe have a majority ownership interest in Empire Education Group, Inc. (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools.\nEEG students receive significant federal financial aid through the U.S. Department of Education. The Department of Education\nhas released proposed rules related to gainful employment that could be detrimental to EEG's business model. If EEG were to\nbecome insolvent, the Department of Education could hold the Company responsible for EEG's liabilities.\n15\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canada and U.K.'s economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond\nour control, such as recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather\npatterns, viruses, pandemics, stay-at-home orders, and other casualty events that influence consumer confidence and spending,\nmay impact our business and results of operations. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by\nincreases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns may impact our\nrevenue.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate, gauge and react in a timely manner to changes in consumer tastes, hair\nproduct innovation, fashion trends and consumer spending patterns. If we do not timely identify and properly respond to\nevolving trends and changing consumer demands for hair care or services, salon sales may decline. Remote work arrangements\nreduce foot traffic in downtowns, city centers, and other business districts where our salons are located, causing a reduction in\nour revenue.\nWe currently are not in compliance with New York Stock Exchange listing requirements.\nIn June 2022, we received written notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that we did not meet certain NYSE\ncontinued listing standards. Under the NYSE continued listing standards, the Company is required to maintain (a) a minimum\naverage closing price of $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, and (b) an average market capitalization\nof at least $50.0 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, and at the same time, total stockholders' equity equal to or\ngreater than $50.0 million. On September 1, 2022, we were notified we cured the minimum average closing price of $1.00 per\nshare, but our average market capitalization was still non-compliant. If our average market capitalization is not greater than\n$50.0 million on December 13, 2023, we will be subject to the NYSE’s suspension and delisting procedures. We are closely\nmonitoring the closing share price of our common stock and are considering all available options. A delisting of our common\nstock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock;\nreducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to\nraise equity financing; limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; decreasing\nthe amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and causing us reputational harm with investors, our employees, and parties\nconducting business with us.\n16\nTable of Contents\nOperating Risks\nWe are substantially dependent on franchise royalties and the overall success of our franchisees' salons.\nOur success is substantially dependent on franchise royalties and the overall success of our franchisees' salons. Many\nfranchisees have seen a decline in revenues in recent years which reduces their profitability. As a result, franchise salon closures\nhave increased, which reduces our royalty income. In addition, franchisees may be unable to pay their royalties which could\ndecrease cash collections. Some franchisees have stopped paying rents as they come due, reduced operating hours, or closed\nbefore the lease end date, which are violations of the lease agreements and may result in penalties depending on the lease,\nwhich may increase our cash outflows when the franchisee subleases from us, or we guarantee the lease. Franchisees who\ndecide to close their salons when there is not another franchisee willing to take over their business decreases the size of our fleet\nand our royalty revenues.\nTo support and enhance our franchisees' businesses, we may need to invest in certain unanticipated new capabilities and/or\nservices and we will need to determine the appropriate amount of investment to optimize the success of our franchisees, while\nensuring that the level of investment supports our expected return on those investments. If we are not able to identify the right\nlevel of support and effectively deliver those resources to our franchisees, our results of operations and business may be\nadversely affected. Furthermore, as a fully-franchised business, we may be exposed to additional legal, compliance and\noperational risks specific to this business model, including the business failure of unproven new salon owners.\nOur salons are dependent on a third-party preferred supplier agreement for merchandise.\nIn fiscal year 2023, we entered into a preferred supplier agreement with a supplier. This change has and will continue to reduce\nour future revenue. If our new supplier is unable to source the products at the prices expected by our franchisees, our\nfranchisees' profitability and our profitability may be adversely impacted. Further, events or circumstances beyond our control,\nincluding economic instability and other impactful events and circumstances in the regions in which our supplier and its\nmanufacturers are located, the financial instability of our supplier, our supplier's failure to meet our terms and conditions or our\nsupplier standards, product safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of products from our supplier and\nits manufacturers to our salons, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating to the\nsupplier and the areas in which it operates, may adversely impact our and our franchisees' profitability.\nIt is important for us and our franchisees to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is strongly dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests and the customer experience in our salons. Qualified,\ntrained stylists are key to a memorable guest experience that creates loyal customers. In order to profitably grow our business, it\nis important for our salons to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons.\nRegulations proposed by the Department of Education, if passed, could reduce access to Federal financial aid for beauty schools\nwhich could reduce the number of qualified stylists to recruit if licensing requirements are not adjusted. Because the salon\nindustry is highly fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is highly competitive. In\naddition, labor shortages and increases in minimum wage requirements may impact the number of stylists considering careers\noutside the beauty industry. In most markets, we and our franchisees have experienced a shortage of qualified stylists or a\nreduction in the hours stylists will work. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education, and training programs are important\nelements to attracting and retaining qualified stylists. In addition, due to challenges facing the for-profit education industry,\ncosmetology schools have experienced declines in enrollment, revenues, and profitability in recent years. If the cosmetology\nschool industry sustains further declines in enrollment or some schools close entirely, or if stylists leave the beauty industry, we\nexpect that we and our franchisees would have increased difficulty staffing our salons in some markets. We are making\nsignificant investments in programs to attract and retain stylists. If our strategies are not successful in attracting, training, and\nretaining stylists or in staffing salons, our system-wide sales or the performance of our business could experience periods of\nvolatility or sales could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n17\nTable of Contents\nOur continued success depends, in part, on the success of our franchisees, which operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2023, 98.6% of our salons were franchised locations. We derive revenues associated with our franchised\nlocations primarily from royalties and fees. Our financial results are therefore substantially dependent upon the operational and\nfinancial success of our franchisees. As a franchise business, we are dependent on our franchisees.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees' businesses are operated. Though we have established operational standards\nand guidelines, franchisees own, operate, and oversee the daily operations of their salon, including employee-related matters\nand pricing. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and\nimage could be harmed, and our financial results could be affected. Additionally, if franchisees do not price their goods and\nservices competitively, the franchisee may fail to maximize the financial performance of their salon. We could experience\ngreater risks as the scale of our franchised salons increases.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by\ncompetition for both guests and stylists, market trends, price competition and disruptions in their markets and business\noperations due to public health issues, including pandemics, severe weather and other external events. Like us, they rely on\nexternal vendors for some critical functions and to protect their company data. They may also be limited in their ability to open\nnew locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially because many of them are small businesses with much\nmore limited access to financing than our Company or by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations.\nThey may also experience financial distress because of over-leveraging, which could negatively affect our operating results due\nto delayed or non-payments to us. The bankruptcy, default, abandonment, or breach by or of a franchisee could also expose us\nto lease liability due to our lease guarantees or subleases as explained previously.\nA deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements or\nclosure of locations adversely affects our operating results through decreased royalty payments and fees. We also must continue\nto attract qualified franchisees and work with them to make their businesses successful.\nIn addition, challenges in supporting our franchise system could cause our operating results to suffer. If we are unable to\neffectively select and train new franchisees and support our growing franchisee base, it could affect our brand standards, cause\ndisputes between us and our franchisees, and potentially lead to material liabilities.\nOur business is dependent on franchisees continuing to operate. When a franchisee exits the franchise system, and we are\nunable to recruit an existing or new franchisee to run that salon location, our salon count and revenues decline. A decline in\nsalon count could also reduce the value of our brands. Additionally, we are dependent on our franchisees to grow their business\nin order for our business to grow. However, franchisees may not have access to capital, labor, etc., to support their growth.\n18\nTable of Contents\nData security and data privacy compliance requirements could increase our costs, and cybersecurity incidents could result in\nthe compromise of potentially sensitive information about our guests, franchisees, employees, vendors, or Company and\nexpose us to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our\nreputation could suffer.\nThe normal operations of our business and our investments in technology involve processing, transmitting and storing\npotentially sensitive personal information about our guests, employees, franchisees, vendors and our Company, all of which\nrequire the appropriate and secure utilization of such information and subjects us to increased focus regarding our data security\ncompliance. Cyber-attacks, including ransomware, designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission\ncritical systems of large organizations (and their third-party vendors) are constantly evolving and high-profile electronic\nsecurity breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive information have occurred at a number of large U.S. companies in\nrecent years. Furthermore, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security in the U.S. and abroad,\nincluding requirements for varying levels of customer notification in the event of a data breach. These laws are changing\nrapidly and vary among jurisdictions. We will continue our efforts to meet any applicable privacy and data security obligations;\nhowever, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase our costs. We rely on\ncommercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing of sensitive\ninformation. As this risk of cyber-attacks increases, our related insurance premiums may also increase. Despite the security\nmeasures and processes we have in place, our efforts (and those of our third-party vendors) to protect sensitive guest, employee,\nfranchisee, vendor, and Company information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems or detecting and\nresponding to a breach on a timely basis. We have, from time to time, experienced threats to, and incidents involving, our\nsystems and information, none of which have been material to date. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems,\nour systems could be interrupted or damaged, and/or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that occurred,\nour guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons\naltogether or our franchisees could exit the system due to lack of confidence. Such events could also lead to lost future sales and\nadversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies'\nobligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could\npotentially subject us to fines, penalties, other regulatory sanctions, or lawsuits with the possibility of substantial damages. The\ncosts to remediate security incidents or breaches that may occur could be material. Also, as cyber-attacks become more\nfrequent, intense, and sophisticated, the costs of proactive defensive measures may increase. Furthermore, while our franchisees\nare independently responsible for data security at their franchised salon locations, a security incident or breach at a franchised\nsalon location could negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and\ndisaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of\noperations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nOur SmartStyle salon operations are dependent on our relationship with Walmart.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had 1,436 SmartStyle or Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations. Walmart is our largest landlord.\nBusiness within each of those 1,436 salons relies primarily on the traffic of visitors to the Walmart location, so our success is\ntied to Walmart's success in bringing shoppers into their stores. We have limited control over the locations and markets in\nwhich we open new SmartStyle locations, as we only have potential opportunities in locations offered to us by Walmart.\nFurthermore, Walmart has the right to (a) close up to 100 salons per year for any reason, upon payment of certain buyout fees;\n(b) terminate lease agreements for breach, such as if we failed to conform with required operating hours, subject to a notice and\ncure period; (c) non-renew the lease agreements if salons fail to reach certain sales thresholds; (d) impose penalties for failing to\nmeet required operation hours; and (e) terminate the lease if the Walmart store is closed. Future franchising activity is\ndependent upon a continued relationship between us and Walmart, as well as Walmart's approval of our proposed franchisee on\na location-by-location basis. Further, Walmart may attempt to impose changes to the terms and conditions of our agreements,\nwhich may be contrary to our economic interests. Operating SmartStyle salons adds complexity in overseeing franchise\ncompliance and coordination with Walmart. Additionally, there are various remodel requirements of our franchisees, whether it\nbe upon lease expiration or the remodeling of a Walmart location. To the extent Walmart accelerates the pace of their own store\nremodels, our salons in remodeled Walmart locations would be held to the same standard. The cost of these remodels may be\nprohibitive to our franchisees and could lead to the Company bearing a portion of the cost, or closures if the remodel\nrequirement is not satisfied.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOur future growth and profitability may depend, in part, on our ability to build awareness and drive traffic with advertising\nand marketing efforts and on delivering a quality guest experience to drive repeat visits to our salons.\nOur future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and spending levels of our marketing and\nadvertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. In addition, delivering a quality guest experience is crucial to\ndrive repeat visits to our salons. We are focusing on improving guest experiences to provide brand differentiation and\npreference as well as ensure our guests' needs are met. If our marketing, advertising, and improved guest experience efforts do\nnot generate sufficient customer traffic and repeat visits to our salons, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations may be adversely affected. Our future growth and profitability may depend on the effectiveness, efficiency and\nspending levels of our marketing and advertising efforts to drive awareness and traffic to our salons. Additionally, we plan to\nincrease our digital marketing efforts, and the success of those efforts is dependent upon our franchisee's migration to the Zenoti\nsalon technology platform and customers opting-in to receive marketing messages from us.\nOur success depends substantially on the migration of our franchisees to the Zenoti salon technology platform.\nThe success of our digital marketing efforts discussed previously, as well as our ability to provide franchisees with back-office\nand salon management support, including walk-in or advanced appointments, is dependent upon our franchisees' adoption of the\nZenoti point-of-sale software. Additionally, some of our technology capabilities will require development by Zenoti, and thus if\nnot developed, may adversely affect our digital marketing efforts and our ability to provide our franchisees with critical\nfunctionality and information.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands, our customers' connection to\nour brands and a positive relationship with our franchisees. Declining franchisee revenue reduces the advertising funds\navailable to invest in the brands and a decline in the Company's investment in its brands could reduce brand awareness and the\noverall value of our brands. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents\nreceive considerable negative publicity, including via social media or if they result in litigation. Some of these incidents may\nrelate to the way we manage our relationships with our franchisees, our growth strategies, our development efforts, or the\nordinary course of our or our franchisees' business. Other incidents may arise from events that may be beyond our control and\nmay damage our brands, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health,\nsafety, welfare, social issues or otherwise, litigation and claims, security breaches or other fraudulent activities associated with\nour back-office management or payment systems, and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Consumer demand for our\nproducts and services and our brands' value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer\nconfidence in us or our products or services. This could result in lower sales and, ultimately, lower royalty income, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes. If we experience an interruption in\ntheir operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our\nmanagement information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, monitor salon performance,\ngenerate payroll information, and other functions. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages,\ncomputer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attempts, security breaches and natural disasters. Certain\ncapabilities or entire systems may become outdated which could limit functionality. These management information systems\nmay require upgrades or replacements periodically, which involve implementation and other operational risks. In addition, our\nmanagement information systems are developed and maintained by external vendors, and we are transitioning our franchisees\nonto the Zenoti salon technology platform. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, to\nmeet the continuously evolving needs of our business, or to provide an affordable long-term solution, could disrupt our business\noperations and result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue and reputational damage.\nFurther, if our external vendors fail to adequately provide technical support for any one of our key existing management\ninformation systems or if new or updated components are not integrated smoothly, we could experience service disruptions that\ncould result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our revenues and generally harm our business,\nreputation and brands. Any such conduct with respect to our franchisees could also result in litigation.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nWe, along with our franchisees, rely on external vendors for the manufacture, supply and distribution of our owned brand\nproducts, other retail products we sell, and products we use during salon services, such as color and chemical treatments. We\nalso rely on external vendors for various services critical to our operations and the security of certain Company data. Our\ndependence upon vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial and compliance risk.\nIf salon product offerings do not meet guests' expectations regarding safety and quality, we could experience lost sales,\nincreased costs, and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws,\nand we are dependent on them to ensure that the products and packages we buy, for either use on a guest during a service or\nresale to the public, comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product\nsafety concerns or mislabeling could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation and result in costly\nproduct recalls and other liabilities.\nOur vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data, as discussed above. If one of our key vendors\nbecomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, or are compromised or the quality of their\nsystems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nThe use of social media may have an adverse effect on our reputation.\nOur reputation is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. However, our reputation may be damaged by negative publicity\non social media or other channels regarding the quality of products or services we provide. There has been a substantial increase\nin the use of social media platforms, which allow individuals to be heard by a broad audience of consumers and other interested\npersons. Negative or false commentary regarding our brands or the products or services we offer may be posted on social media\nplatforms at any time. Customers value readily available information and may act on information without further investigation\nor regard to its accuracy. The harm to our reputation may be immediate, without affording us an opportunity for redress or\ncorrection. Our reputation may also be damaged by factors that are mostly or entirely out of our control, including actions by a\nfranchisee or a franchisee's employee.\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these\nplatforms, the failure by us, our employees, franchisees or third parties acting at our direction, to abide by applicable laws and\nregulations in the use of these platforms could adversely affect our business, financial condition and revenues.\nOur enterprise risk management program may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor the risks that we\nface. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for assessing and managing known risks, compliance with\napplicable laws and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in all market environments or against all types\nof risk in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance\nprograms, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by, or made available to, us in order to manage certain types of\nrisks, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, retentions, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of denial of\ncoverage, default or insolvency. If we suffer unexpected or uncovered losses, or if any of our insurance policies or programs are\nterminated for any reason or are not effective in mitigating our risks, we may incur losses that are not covered or that exceed\nour coverage limits and could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nOur franchise agreements require each franchisee to maintain specified insurance coverages and levels. Certain extraordinary\nhazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive\nrates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to\nfranchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a\nfranchisee's ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise agreement, including its ability to make royalty payments.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, which would materially adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make interest payments and comply with debt covenants associated with our indebtedness depends on our ability\nto generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative,\nregulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Specifically, our interest payments are based on the secured overnight\nfinancing rate (SOFR), such that an increase in the SOFR will have a negative impact on our cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our existing financing arrangement, we may not be able to access our\nexisting revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms in our existing financing arrangements, such a failure may cause a default under our\nfinancing arrangement, which could limit our ability to obtain new replacement financing or additional financing under our\nexisting credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligation to repay our indebtedness. The\nimpacts of significant business disruptions could ultimately impair our ability to comply with our covenants, which could\npreclude our ability to access our credit facility or accelerate our debt repayment obligation, which is secured by a lien on\nsubstantially all of the Company's assets.\nWe have limited resources to invest in our business and execute on our strategic plans.\nUnder our current operating and financial model, we use the cash we generate and borrow to cover the operating costs of our\nbusiness as it is currently conducted and to pay interest expense on outstanding debt. We have limited capital resources\navailable to invest in further execution of our strategy to grow our business. While management’s projections demonstrate our\nability to continue funding our business in this manner through the maturity of our revolving credit facility in August 2025, we\ndo not expect to have access to additional cash to make further investments in the business. In order for the Company to be able\nto repay its debt in full upon maturity, or restructure the debt prior to August 2025, the Company will likely need to explore\noptions for refinancing the indebtedness, and the availability of such options depends on the ability of the Company to continue\nto improve its cash from operations and other market conditions.\nPremature termination of franchise agreements can cause losses.\nOur franchise agreements may be subject to premature termination in certain circumstances, such as failure of a franchisee to\ncure a default, monetary or otherwise, a franchisee bankruptcy, voluntary termination, or abandonment of the franchise. If\nterminations occur for these or other reasons, we may need to enforce our right to damages for breach of contract and related\nclaims, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and expenses and/or to take back and operate such salons as\ncompany-owned salons. Any damages we ultimately collect could be less than the projected future value of the fees and other\namounts we would have otherwise collected under the franchise agreement. In addition, with many of our brands, we remain\nliable under the lease and, therefore, will be obligated to pay rent or enter a settlement with the landlord, and we may not be\nmade whole by the franchisee. A significant loss of franchisee agreements due to premature terminations could hurt our\nfinancial performance or our ability to grow our business.\nEmpire Education Group, Inc. may be unsuccessful, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell to the other owner our 55.1% ownership stake in EEG. The transaction is subject\nto regulatory approval before it can close, and there is no guarantee that the regulatory approval will occur. Due to poor\nfinancial performance of EEG, we fully impaired the investment in prior years. If the transaction does not close as anticipated\nand EEG is unsuccessful in executing its business plan, or if economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in\nenrollment, revenue and profitability, continue for the for-profit secondary education market, our financial results may be\naffected by certain potential liabilities related to this investment.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing\nexpenses, professional fees, operating lease costs, other expenses, or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving\nincreased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\n22\nTable of Contents\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market-by-market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with\nlocal operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry, as a whole, is fragmented and highly competitive for\ncustomers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in\ncertain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. Our strategies for competing are complicated by the fact that we\nhave multiple brands in multiple segments, which compete on different factors. We also face significant competition for prime\nreal estate, particularly in strip malls. We compete for lease locations not only with other hair salons, but with a wide variety of\nbusinesses looking for similar square footage and high-quality locations. If we are unable to successfully compete, we may lose\nmarket share and our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nCorporate Structure and Governance Risks\nWe rely on our management team and other key personnel.\nWe depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our management team and\nothers throughout our Company. We are also dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, for whom we\ncompete with other companies both inside and outside our industry. We may be required to increase wages and/or benefits to\nattract and retain qualified personnel or risk considerable turnover. Our business, financial condition or results of operations\nmay be adversely impacted by the unexpected loss of any of our management team or other key personnel, or more generally if\nwe fail to identify, recruit, train and/or retain talented personnel. In addition, our business may be harmed if we lose too many\nindividuals with institutional knowledge.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately\nreport our financial results and prevent or detect material misstatements due to fraud, which could reduce investor\nconfidence and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively\nprevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our\noperating results could be materially misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies\nfrom occurring, which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, reduce investor confidence, cause the market price of our\ncommon stock to decline or have other potential adverse consequences. Commencing with our fiscal 2023 audit, and as a result\nof our smaller reporting company status, we are not required to obtain, nor did we obtain, an audit of our system of internal\ncontrols over financial reporting.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our\ntax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax\nmatters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood\nof an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and\npayroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our\nhistorical tax provisions and employment taxes. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our\nConsolidated Financial Statements in the period or periods where that determination is made. Also, in the future, our effective\nincome tax rate could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with\ndifferent statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or the outcome of income examinations.\nOur ability to use our U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain\nlimitations.\nUtilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation if an ownership change occurs under\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. An ownership change could be triggered by subsequent sales of securities\nby us, or our shareholders and such a change of ownership may limit our utilization of net operating losses.\n23\nTable of Contents\nLitigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation, proceedings or claims,\nincluding possible fines and penalties, could have an adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may\nbe inadequate to cover actual losses.\nFrom time-to-time in the ordinary course of our business operations, we are subject to litigation, including potential class action\nand single-plaintiff litigation, arbitration and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims. Litigation to defend ourselves\nagainst claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could\nrequire significant time commitments from our management team and result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources,\nwhich may cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and revenues. We establish accruals for potential\nliabilities arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liabilities are probable, and\nthe amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a\nmatter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain\nmatter or in the aggregate. Any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings as well as claims could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or revenues.\n24\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company leases its corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the lease expires in 2030.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company exited its distribution centers located in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Salt Lake City, Utah and\nsigned agreements to sublease the facilities in the short-term before a full lease novation in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The\nCompany also exited its Fremont, California office in fiscal year 2023 and is actively trying to sublet the space that has a lease\nobligation through September 30, 2024.\nThe Company leases the premises in which approximately 87% of its franchisees operate and has entered into corresponding\nsublease arrangements with these franchisees. Generally, these leases have a five-year initial term and one or more five-year\nrenewal options. All lease costs are passed through to the franchisees. Remaining franchisees who do not enter into sublease\narrangements with the Company negotiate and enter into leases on their own behalf. As leases renew, the Company intends for\nfranchisees to sign the non-Walmart leases directly so it will no longer be the primary tenant.\nThe Company operates all its company-owned salons under lease agreements with original terms of at least five years, generally\nwith the ability to renew at the Company's option, for one or more additional five-year periods. Approximately half of our\ncompany-owned salons have leases that expire in January 2024, which the Company does not intend to renew.\nNone of the Company's salon leases are individually material to the operations of the Company, and the Company expects that\nit will be able to renew its leases on satisfactory terms as they expire or identify and secure other suitable locations. See Note 6\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is a defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Like certain other\nfranchisors, the Company has been faced with allegations of franchise regulation and agreement violations. Additionally,\nbecause the Company may be the tenant under a master lease for a location subleased to a franchisee, the Company faces\nallegations of non-payment of rent and associated charges. Further, similar to other large retail employers, the Company has\nbeen faced with allegations of purported class-wide consumer and wage and hour violations. Litigation is inherently\nunpredictable, and the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Although the actions are being vigorously\ndefended, the Company could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material\nadverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period.

Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities\nMarket Information\nThe Company's common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"RGS.\"\nHolders\nAs of August 16, 2023, the Company had approximately 1,126 shareholders of record. The closing stock price was $1.23 per\nshare on August 16, 2023.\nDividends\nIn accordance with its capital allocation policy, the Company does not pay dividends.\nShare Issuance Program\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement and $50.0 million prospectus supplement\nwith the SEC under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0 million worth of its common stock in \"at-the-\nmarket\" offerings. During fiscal year 2023, the Company did not issue shares. As of June 30, 2023, $11.6 million remains\navailable under the prospectus supplement, which equates to 10.4 million shares based on the share price as of June 30, 2023.\nThe Company issued the following common stock through its share issuance program:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nIssued shares — 9,295,618 —\nAverage price (per share) $ — $4.13 $ —\nPrice range (per share) $ — $3.76 - $5.99 $ —\nTotal $ — $38.4 million $ —\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn May 2000, the Company's Board of Directors (Board) approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date.\nSince that time and through June 30, 2023, the Board has authorized $650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the\nCompany's stock under this program. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The\ntiming and amounts of any repurchases depends on many factors, including the market price of the common stock and overall\nmarket conditions. During fiscal year 2023, the Company did not repurchase shares. As of June 30, 2023, 30.0 million shares\nhave been cumulatively repurchased for $595.4 million, and $54.6 million remained authorized for repurchase. The Company\ndoes not anticipate repurchasing shares of common stock for the foreseeable future.\nItem 6. Reserved\nNot applicable.\n26\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a\nreader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of\noperations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results.\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION\nRegis Corporation (the Company) franchises, owns and operates beauty salons. As of June 30, 2023, the Company franchised\nor owned 4,863 salons in North America and the United Kingdom. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer\nsimilar salon products and services and serve the mass market. As of June 30, 2023, we had 435 corporate employees\nworldwide. See discussion within Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K.\nAs part of the Company's strategic transition to a fully-franchised model, the Company is selling salons to franchisees. The\nimpact of these transactions is as follows:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalons sold to franchisees 1 110 748\nCash proceeds received $ — $ — $ 8,437\nLoss from sale of salon assets to franchisees, net $ — $ (2,334) $ (16,696)\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company sold its Opensalon® Pro (OSP) software-as-a-service solution to Soham Inc. The Company\nreceived $13.0 million in proceeds in June 2022 and received an additional $5.0 million in proceeds in fiscal year 2023, offset\nby a $0.5 million transaction fee. The Company expects to receive an additional $2.0 million of proceeds held back for general\nindemnity provisions in December 2024 and additional proceeds as salons migrate to the Zenoti platform. As a result of the\nsale, the Company classified the OSP business as discontinued operations in the financial statements as discussed in Note 3 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company shifted its product business from a wholesale model to a third-party distribution model as part of its asset-light\ntransformation. In fiscal year 2022, the Company exited its distribution centers and ceased selling products to franchisees.\nFranchisees source product from a third-party distribution partner and the Company receives a royalty payment based on\nfranchisee purchases. This change has significantly decreased both the Company's franchise product revenue and general and\nadministrative expense, including the Franchise distribution costs discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.

Also included in fiscal year 2021 was the write-off of marketing and promotional items.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company reports its operations in two operating segments: Franchise salons and Company-owned salons.\nCOVID-19 Impact:\nThe global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had an adverse impact on operations. As a result, the Company received\nCanadian rent relief, Canadian wage relief, U.S. employee retention payroll tax credits and a grant from the state of North\nCarolina. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company received the following financial assistance:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nFinancial Statement Caption (Dollars in thousands)\nCanadian rent relief Rent $ — $ 1,235 $ —\nCanadian wage relief Company-owned salon expense — 1,966 1,629\nU.S. employee retention payroll tax credit Company-owned salon expense — — 1,547\nNorth Carolina COVID-19 grant Other, net 1,106 — —\nAdditionally, in both December 2022 and December 2021, the Company paid $2.5 million of social security contributions that\nhad been deferred under the CARES Act.\nSystem-wide results\nOur results are impacted by our system-wide sales, which include sales by all points of distribution, whether owned by our\nfranchisees or the Company. While we do not record sales by franchisees as revenue, and such sales are not included in our\nConsolidated Financial Statements, we believe that this operating measure is important in obtaining an understanding of our\nfinancial performance. We believe system-wide sales information aids in understanding how we derive royalty revenue and in\nevaluating performance. In fiscal year 2023, a net 600 franchise salons have closed, which reduces future royalty income.\nThe following table summarizes system-wide revenue and system-wide same-store sales (1) by concept:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in millions)\nSystem-wide revenue $ 1,230.5 $ 1,228.5 $ 1,086.0\nSupercuts 6.9 % 22.1 % (25.8) %\nSmartStyle (2.5) 5.7 (26.7)\nPortfolio Brands 5.5 11.2 (24.8)\nTotal system-wide same-store sales 4.4 % 14.8 % (25.8) %\n____________________________________________________________________________\n(1) System-wide same-store sales are calculated as the total change in sales for system-wide franchise and company-\nowned locations that were open on a specific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior\nperiod. System-wide same-store sales are the sum of the system-wide same-store sales computed on a daily basis.\nFranchise salons that do not report daily sales are excluded from same-store sales. System-wide same-store sales are\ncalculated in local currencies to remove foreign currency fluctuations from the calculation.\n28\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain information derived from our Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe decrease of $14.5 million, or 22.2%, in general and administrative expense during fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to\nlower administrative and field management compensation resulting from headcount reductions, lower legal and professional\nfees and a decrease in expenses associated with the distribution centers closures in fiscal year 2022.\nRent\nThe decrease of $0.2 million, or 2.1%, in rent expense during fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the net reduction in the\nnumber of company-owned salons, partially offset by a $1.2 million benefit in fiscal year 2022 related to Canadian COVID-19\nrent relief.\nAdvertising Fund Expense\nAdvertising fund expense decreased $0.9 million, or 2.8%, during fiscal year 2023, primarily due to the decrease in franchise\nsalon count, partially offset by improved system-wide same-store sales.\n30\nTable of Contents\nFranchise Rent Expense\nDuring fiscal year 2023, franchise rent expense decreased $19.4 million, or 14.8%, primarily due to the decrease in franchise\nsalon count.\nCompany-owned Salon Expense\nCompany-owned salon expense decreased $13.2 million, or 60.0%, during fiscal year 2023, primarily due to the reduction in\ncompany-owned salon count, a decline in product sales and an inventory reserve charge of $2.8 million in fiscal year 2022\nincluded in company-owned salon expense. These decreases were partially offset by $2.0 million of Canadian COVID-19 wage\nrelief received in fiscal year 2022.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe increase of $1.5 million, or 24.2%, in depreciation and amortization during fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a $2.6\nmillion accelerated depreciation charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the consolidation of office space\nwithin the Company's corporate headquarters, partially offset by lower asset retirement obligations (\"white boxing\" salons at\nlease end) and the net reduction in company-owned salon count.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.1 million, and in fiscal year 2022, the\nCompany recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of $0.5 million. The decrease in long-lived asset impairment was\nprimarily due to more salon ROU assets being impaired in prior periods.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge, and during fiscal year 2022, the Company\nrecorded a goodwill impairment charge of $13.1 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8,\nof this Form 10-K.\nInterest Expense\nThe $9.2 million increase in interest expense during fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the increase of $1.1 million in\namortization of fees related to the credit amendment that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and a higher\nweighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including non-cash paid-in-kind interest of $1.0 million.\nLoss from Sale of Salon Assets to Franchisees, net\nThere was one salon sold in fiscal year 2023 compared to 110 in fiscal year 2022, which resulted in a $2.3 million improvement\nin the loss from sale of salon assets to franchises, net.\nOther, net\nOther, net improved $1.7 million in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to a $1.1 million grant received from the state of North\nCarolina related to COVID-19 relief and a class action settlement.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $0.7 million, with a corresponding effective tax rate\nof 5.5%, compared to recognizing income tax expense of $2.0 million, with a corresponding effective tax rate of (4.5)% during\nfiscal year 2022. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nIncome (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded income from discontinued operations of $4.0 million and in fiscal year 2022, the\nCompany recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $39.4 million. Income in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to the\nreceipt of $5.0 million sales proceeds offset by a $0.5 million transaction fee and other expenses from the sale of OSP. The loss\nin fiscal year 2022 includes the loss from the sale of OSP, including goodwill derecognition of $38.4 million, partially offset by\nproceeds from the sale. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\n31\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations by Segment\nBased on our internal management structure, we report two segments: Franchise salons and Company-owned salons. See Note\n15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. Significant results of continuing operations\nare discussed below with respect to each of these segments.\nFranchise Salons\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\n(Dollars in millions) Increase (Decrease) (1)\nRoyalties $ 66.0 $ 65.8 $ 52.4 $ 0.2 $ 13.4\nFees 11.3 11.6 10.2 (0.3) 1.4\nProduct sales to franchisees 2.8 15.1 56.7 (12.3) (41.6)\nAdvertising fund contributions 31.7 32.6 22.0 (0.9) 10.6\nFranchise rental income 111.4 130.8 127.4 (19.4) 3.4\nTotal franchise revenue (1) $ 223.2 $ 255.8 $ 268.7 $ (32.6) $ (12.9)\nFranchise same-store sales (2) 4.4 % 15.0 % (24.5) %\nFranchise adjusted EBITDA $ 22.8 $ 7.7 $ (29.4) $ 15.1 $ 37.1\nTotal franchise salons 4,795 5,395 5,563 (600) (168)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not sum to total due to rounding.\n(2) Franchise same-store sales are calculated as the total change in sales for franchise locations that were open on a\nspecific day of the week during the current period and the corresponding prior period. Year-to-date franchise same-\nstore sales are the sum of the franchise same-store sales computed on a daily basis. Franchise salons that do not report\ndaily sales are excluded from same-store sales. Franchise same-store sales are calculated in local currencies to remove\nforeign currency fluctuations from the calculation.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nFranchise Revenue\nFranchise revenue decreased $32.6 million during fiscal year 2023. The decrease in franchise revenue was primarily due to the\ndecrease in franchise rental income as a result of lower salon count and the decrease in product sales to franchisees due to the\nCompany's shift to a third-party distributor model. During fiscal year 2023, franchisees purchased one salon from the Company\nand constructed (net of relocations) and closed 15 and 616 franchise salons, respectively.\nFranchise Adjusted EBITDA\nDuring fiscal year 2023, franchise adjusted EBITDA totaled $22.8 million, an improvement of $15.1 million compared to fiscal\nyear 2022. The improvement is primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expense.\n32\nTable of Contents\nCompany-Owned Salons\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022\n(Dollars in millions) (Decrease) Increase (1)\nTotal revenue $ 10.1 $ 20.2 $ 143.0 $ (10.1) $ (122.8)\nCompany-owned salon adjusted EBITDA $ (1.8) $ (9.5) $ (47.5) $ 7.7 $ 38.0\nTotal Company-owned salons 68 105 276 (37) (171)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Total is a recalculation; line items calculated individually may not sum to total due to rounding.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nCompany-owned Salon Revenue\nCompany-owned salon revenue decreased $10.1 million in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to decrease in company-owned salon\ncount and a decline in product sales in salons.\nCompany-owned Salon Adjusted EBITDA\nDuring fiscal year 2023, Company-owned salon adjusted EBITDA improved $7.7 million, primarily due to the closure of\nunprofitable salons. Fiscal year 2023 also benefited from a $1.1 million grant received from the state of North Carolina related\nto COVID-19 relief.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this\nForm 10-K.\n33\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFollowing the amendment of the Company's credit agreement in August 2022, the facility matures in August 2025. In addition\nto a $10.0 million minimum liquidity covenant, the amended credit agreement includes typical provisions and financial\ncovenants, including minimum EBITDA, leverage and fixed-charge coverage ratio covenants, the latter two of which are not\ntested until December 31, 2023. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nSources of Liquidity\nFunds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and our borrowing agreements are our most\nsignificant sources of liquidity. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity, cash on hand and borrowing capacity, to meet\nits obligations in the next twelve months and until maturity of the credit agreement in August 2025. In conducting the\nCompany’s current operations, all cash in excess of the amounts needed to support existing operating activities is used to pay\nthe interest on the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement, and we are periodically borrowing additional amounts to\ncover these operating and interest expense costs.\nAs of June 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $9.5 million, with $8.7 and $0.8 million within the United States and\nCanada, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company's borrowing arrangements include a $172.3 million term loan and a $55.0 million revolving\ncredit facility with a $10.0 million minimum liquidity covenant that expires in August 2025. As of June 30, 2023, the unused\navailable credit under the revolving credit facility was $33.3 million and total liquidity per the agreement was $42.8 million.\nSee additional discussion under Financing Arrangements and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8,\nof this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, on February 3, 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration and $50.0 million prospectus\nsupplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0\nmillion worth of its common stock in \"at-the-market\" offerings. Net proceeds from sales of shares under the \"at-the-market\"\nprogram, if any, may be used to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, repay debt and support of our brands\nand franchisees. The timing and amount of sales of shares, if any, will depend on a variety of factors, including prevailing\nmarket conditions, the trading price of shares, and other factors as determined by the Company. During fiscal year 2023, the\nCompany did not issue shares under the prospectus supplement. As of June 30, 2023, 9.3 million shares have been cumulatively\nissued for $38.4 million, and $11.6 million remains outstanding under the share issuance program.\nUses of Cash\nThe Company closely manages its liquidity and capital resources. The Company's liquidity requirements depend on key\nvariables, including the performance of the business, the level of investment needed to support its business strategies, credit\nfacilities and borrowing arrangements, and working capital management. The Company has a disciplined approach to capital\nallocation, which focuses on ensuring we can meet our interest obligations and investing in key priorities to support the\nCompany's strategic plan as discussed within Part I, Item 1. Additional information about the Company's current use of cash is\ndescribed under \"Sources of Liquidity.\"\nCash Requirements\nThe Company's most significant contractual cash requirements as of June 30, 2023 were lease commitments and interest\npayments. See Notes 6 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K for further detail.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2023, cash used in operating activities was $7.9 million. Cash used in operations improved due to lower\ngeneral and administrative expense resulting from a reduced headcount, a $1.1 million cash grant received from the state of\nNorth Carolina related to COVID-19 relief, $0.6 million received related to COVID-19 employee retention credits and less cash\nused for working capital. Cash used in fiscal year 2023 included a $2.5 million payment of previously deferred social security\ncontributions.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2023, cash provided by investing activities of $4.0 million was primarily related to cash received of $5.0\nmillion from the sale of OSP, partially offset by a $0.5 million transaction fee.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nDuring fiscal year 2023, cash used in financing activities of $2.1 million was primarily as a result of debt refinancing fees of\n$4.4 million, partially offset by a net $2.3 million borrowing under the Company's revolving credit facility.\n35\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Arrangements\nFinancing activities are discussed in Note 8 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this\nForm 10-K. Derivative activities are discussed in Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market\nRisk.\"\nThe Company's financing arrangements consist of the following:\nJune 30,\nMaturity Dates 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(Fiscal year) (Interest rate %) (Dollars in thousands)\nTerm loan 2026 9.54% N/A $ 172,268 $ —\nDeferred financing fees (6,471) —\nTerm loan, net 165,797 —\nRevolving credit facility 2026 9.54% 5.50% 10,000 179,994\nPaid-in-kind interest 1,033 —\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 176,830 $ 179,994\nIn August 2022, the Company amended its credit agreement and extended the maturity to August 2025. Under the amendment,\nthe $295.0 million revolving credit facility was converted to a $180.0 million term loan and reduced commitments under the\nrevolving credit facility to $55.0 million, with the minimum liquidity covenant reduced to $10.0 million from $75.0 million.\nThe agreement includes typical provisions and financial covenants, including minimum EBITDA, leverage and fixed-charge\ncoverage ratio covenants, the latter two of which are not tested until December 31, 2023. Total liquidity and available credit\nunder the revolving credit facility, as defined by the agreement, were $42.8 and $33.3 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $176.8 and $180.0 million, respectively, of net outstanding borrowings. The\nagreement utilizes an interest rate margin that is subject to annual increases. The margin applicable to term secured overnight\nfinancing rate (SOFR) loans was 3.875% through March 27, 2023. Effective March 27, 2023, the margin increased to 6.25%, of\nwhich 4.25% is paid currently in cash and 2.00% is paid-in-kind (PIK) interest (added to the principal balance and thereafter\naccruing interest). Effective March 27, 2024, the margin will increase to 7.25%, of which 4.25% will be paid currently in cash\nand 3.00% will be PIK interest. The margin applicable to base rate loans will be 100 basis points (1.00%) less than the margin\napplicable to term SOFR loans. See additional discussion in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8,\nof this Form 10-K.\nOur debt to capitalization ratio, calculated as the principal amount of debt, including paid-in-kind interest accrued, as a\npercentage of the principal amount of debt and shareholders' deficit at fiscal year-end, was as follows:\nDebt to\nAs of June 30, Capitalization (1)\n2023 125.1 %\n2022 120.8 %\n2021 91.6 %\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Excludes the long-term lease liability as that liability is offset by the ROU asset.\nThe increase in the debt to capitalization ratio as of June 30, 2023 compared to June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the increase\nin shareholders' deficit as a result of the net loss.\n36\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nOn-Balance Sheet Obligations\nOur debt obligations are primarily composed of our credit agreement at June 30, 2023.\nNon-current deferred benefits of $6.0 million includes $1.8 million related to a non-qualified deferred salary plan, a salary\ndeferral program of $2.0 million and a bonus deferral plan of $2.2 million related to established contractual payment obligations\nunder retirement and severance agreements for a small number of employees. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nOperating leases primarily represent long-term obligations for the rental of salons, including leases for company-owned\nlocations, as well as salon franchisee lease obligations, which are reimbursed to the Company by franchisees. Regarding\nfranchisee subleases, we generally retain the right to the related salon assets, net of any outstanding obligations, in the event of\na default by a franchise owner. Declines in system-wide revenue in certain brands over the past few years have increased the\nrisk of default by franchisees, which may be material.\nThe Company has unfunded deferred compensation contracts covering certain management and executive personnel. We cannot\npredict the timing or amount of future payments related to these contracts. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we have liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which\nthe liabilities will increase or decrease over time; however, at this time, we do not expect a significant payment related to these\nobligations within the next fiscal year. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-\nK.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnder the credit agreement entered into in August 2022, the applicable margins for the loans bearing interest are subject to\nannual increases. The margin applicable to loans bearing interest at SOFR was 3.875% through March 27, 2023. Effective\nMarch 27, 2023, the margin increased to 6.25%, of which 4.25% is paid currently in cash and 2.00% is PIK interest (added to\nthe principal balance and thereafter accruing interest). Effective March 27, 2024, the margin will increase to 7.25%, of which\n4.25% will be paid currently in cash and 3.00% will be PIK interest. The margin applicable to base rate loans will be 100 basis\npoints (1.00%) less than the margin applicable to SOFR loans. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,\nItem 8, of this Form 10-K.\nWe are a party to a variety of contractual agreements that we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters,\nwhich indemnities may be secured by operation of law or otherwise, in the ordinary course of business. These contracts\nprimarily relate to our commercial contracts, operating leases and other real estate contracts, financial agreements, agreements\nto provide services and agreements to indemnify officers, directors, and employees in the performance of their work. While our\naggregate indemnification obligation could result in a material liability, we are not aware of any current matter that we expect\nwill result in a material liability.\nWe do not have any unconditional purchase obligations or significant other commercial commitments such as standby\nrepurchase obligations.\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as\nstructured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance\nsheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at June 30, 2023. As such, we are not materially\nexposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\n37\nTable of Contents\nDividends\nThe Company has not declared a quarterly dividend payment since December 2013.\nShare Issuance Program\nIn February 2021, the Company filed a $150.0 million shelf registration statement and $50.0 million prospectus supplement\nwith the SEC under which it may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $50.0 million worth of its common stock in \"at-the-\nmarket\" offerings. During fiscal year 2023, the Company did not issue shares under the prospectus supplement. As of June 30,\n2023, 9.3 million shares have been cumulatively issued for $38.4 million, and $11.6 million remains outstanding under the\nshare issuance program.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn May 2000, the Board approved a stock repurchase program with no stated expiration date. Since that time and through\nJune 30, 2023, the Board has authorized $650.0 million to be expended for the repurchase of the Company's stock under this\nprogram. All repurchased shares become authorized but unissued shares of the Company. The timing and amounts of any\nrepurchases depends on many factors, including the market price of the common stock and overall market conditions. During\nfiscal year 2023, the Company did not repurchase shares. As of June 30, 2023, 30.0 million shares have been cumulatively\nrepurchased for $595.4 million, and $54.6 million remained authorized for repurchase. The Company does not anticipate\nrepurchasing shares of common stock for the foreseeable future.\n38\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make various judgments, estimates and\nassumptions that could have a significant impact on the results reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We base\nthese estimates on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are\nconsidered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions about material matters\nthat are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made, and (2) other materially different estimates could have been\nreasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Changes in these\nestimates could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this\nForm 10-K. We believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our\nreported financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Franchise reporting unit had $173.8 and $174.4 million of goodwill, respectively, and the\nCompany-owned segment had no goodwill at either period. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\n8, of this Form 10-K. The Company assesses goodwill impairment on an annual basis as of April 30, and between annual\nassessments if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting\nunit below its carrying amount.\nGoodwill impairment assessments are performed at the reporting unit level, which is the same as the Company's operating\nsegments. The goodwill assessment involves a one-step comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill (Step 1). If the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required.\nHowever, if the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference\nbetween the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit.\nIn applying the goodwill impairment assessment, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than its carrying value (Step 0). Qualitative factors may include,\nbut are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors, and overall financial performance of the reporting\nunit. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the carrying value is less\nthan the fair value, then performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment assessment is unnecessary.\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting\nunit, including allocation of shared or corporate balances among reporting units. Allocations are generally based on the number\nof salons in each reporting unit as a percent of total salons or expenses of the reporting unit as a percentage of total company\nexpenses.\nThe Company calculates estimated fair values of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows utilizing estimates in\nannual revenue, fixed expense rates, allocated corporate overhead, franchise and company-owned salon counts, and long-term\ngrowth rates for determining terminal value. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used in\nconjunction with the results of the discounted cash flows. The Company engages third-party valuation consultants to assist in\nevaluating the Company's estimated fair value calculations. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\n8, of this Form 10-K.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLong-Lived Assets, Excluding Goodwill\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment and applies the guidance to property, plant,\nand equipment as well as right of use (ROU) assets. The Company has identified its asset groups at the individual salon level as\nthis represents the lowest level that identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets\nand liabilities. Poor salon performance in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in ASC 360-10-35-21 triggering events. As\na result, management assessed underperforming salon asset groups, which included the related ROU assets, for impairment in\naccordance with ASC 360.\nThe first step in the impairment test under ASC 360 is to determine whether the long-lived assets are recoverable, which is\ndetermined by comparing the net carrying value of the salon asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated\nfrom the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. Estimating cash flows for purposes of the recoverability test is\nsubjective and requires significant judgment. Estimated future cash flows used for the purposes of the recoverability test were\nbased upon historical cash flows for the salons, adjusted for expected changes in future market conditions and other factors. The\nperiod of time used to determine the estimates of the future cash flows for the recoverability test was based on the remaining\nuseful life of the primary asset of the group, which was the ROU asset in all cases.\nThe second step of the long-lived asset impairment test requires that the fair value of the asset group be estimated when\ndetermining the amount of any impairment loss. For the salon asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss\nwas measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company applied the\nfair value guidance within ASC 820-10 to determine the fair value of the asset group from the perspective of a market-\nparticipant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous\nmarket, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. To determine the fair value of the salon asset groups,\nthe Company utilized market-participant assumptions rather than the Company's own assumptions about how it intends to use\nthe asset group. The significant judgments and assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the salon asset groups include\nthe market rent of comparable properties and a discount rate. The fair value of the salon long-lived asset group is estimated\nusing market participant methods based on the best information available. The fair value of the right of use asset is estimated by\ndetermining what a market participant would pay over the life of the primary asset in the group, discounted back to June 30,\n2023.\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $0.1 and $0.5 million,\nrespectively, related to ROU assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During\nfiscal year 2021, the Company recognized a long-lived asset impairment charge of $13.0 million, which included $9.5 million\nrelated to ROU assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The impairment loss\nfor each salon asset group that was recognized was allocated among the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using\ntheir relative carrying amounts. Additionally, the impairment losses did not reduce the carrying amount of an individual asset\nbelow its fair value, including the ROU assets included in the salon asset groups. Assessing the long-lived assets for impairment\nrequires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment which can be affected by economic conditions and other\nfactors that can be difficult to predict. The Company does not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a\nmaterial change in the estimates or assumptions it uses to calculate impairment losses for its long-lived assets, including its\nROU assets. If actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations, the Company may\nbe exposed to future impairment losses that could be material.\n40\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial Statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently\nenacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. The Company\nevaluates all evidence, including recent financial performance, the existence of cumulative year losses and our forecast of future\ntaxable income, to assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. While the determination of whether\nto record a valuation allowance is not fully governed by a specific objective test, accounting guidance places significant weight\non recent financial performance.\nThe Company has a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets amounting to $202.2 and $201.7 million at June 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net\nrecorded amount, we would make necessary adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company determined that it no longer had sufficient U.S. state indefinite-lived taxable temporary\ndifferences to support realization of its U.S. state indefinite-lived NOLs and its existing U.S. deferred tax assets that upon\nreversal are expected to generate state indefinite-lived NOLs. As a result, the Company recorded a $4.1 million valuation\nallowance on its U.S. state indefinite-lived deferred tax assets.\nThe Company reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties related to anticipated tax audit positions in the U.S.\nand other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately\nproves to be unnecessary, the reversal of these liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it\nis determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties\nproves to be less than the ultimate assessment, additional expenses would result.\nInherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of tax laws and published guidance\nwith respect to the Company's operations. Income tax expense is primarily the current tax payable for the period and the change\nduring the period in certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.\n41\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nThe primary market risk exposure of the Company relates to changes in interest rates in connection with its credit agreement,\nwhich bears interest at variable rates based on SOFR plus an applicable borrowing margin. Additionally, the Company is\nexposed to foreign currency translation risk related to changes in the Canadian dollar, and to a lesser extent, the British pound.\nThe Company has established policies and procedures that govern the management of these exposures through the use of\nderivative financial instrument contracts. By policy, the Company does not enter into such contracts for the purpose of\nspeculation. The following details the Company's policies and use of financial instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk:\nThe Company has established an interest rate management policy that attempts to minimize its overall cost of debt. The\nCompany's interest payments are based on the SOFR, such that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in the SOFR\nwill have a $1.8 million annual impact on our annual cash flows. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding variable\nrate debt of $183.3 million and the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swaps.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk:\nOver 90% of the Company's operations are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Company's operations\nconsist of activities outside of the U.S., the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, and to\na lesser extent, the British pound. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is required to translate the\nfinancial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records, generally the\nlocal currency, into U.S. dollars. Different exchange rates from period to period impact the amounts of reported income and the\namount of foreign currency translation recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). As part of its risk\nmanagement strategy, the Company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and\nexternal factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, the Company may engage in transactions involving\nvarious derivative instruments to hedge assets, liabilities and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As of June 30, 2023,\nthe Company did not have any derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risk.\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a $0.3 million foreign currency loss, $0.6 million foreign\ncurrency loss and a $0.3 million foreign currency gain in loss from continuing operations, respectively, in the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n42\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting\nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. We determined that there\nare no critical audit matters.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nAugust 23, 2023\n44\nTable of Contents\nREGIS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nJune 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 9,508 $ 17,041\nReceivables, net 10,885 14,531\nInventories 1,681 3,109\nOther current assets 15,164 13,984\nTotal current assets 37,238 48,665\nProperty and equipment, net 6,422 12,835\nGoodwill (Note 5) 173,791 174,360\nOther intangibles, net 2,783 3,226\nRight of use asset (Note 6) 360,836 493,749\nOther assets 26,307 36,465\nTotal assets $ 607,377 $ 769,300\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 14,309 $ 15,860\nAccrued expenses 30,109 33,784\nShort-term lease liability (Note 6) 81,917 103,196\nTotal current liabilities 126,335 152,840\nLong-term debt, net (Note 8) 176,830 179,994\nLong-term lease liability (Note 6) 291,901 408,445\nOther non-current liabilities 49,041 58,974\nTotal liabilities 644,107 800,253\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 9)\nShareholders' deficit:\nCommon stock, $0.05 par value; issued and outstanding, 45,566,228 and 45,510,245\n2,278 2,276\ncommon shares as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively\nAdditional paid-in capital 64,600 62,562\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 9,023 9,455\nAccumulated deficit (112,631) (105,246)\nTotal shareholders' deficit (36,730) (30,953)\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' deficit $ 607,377 $ 769,300\n______________________________________________________________________________\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nTable of Contents\nREGIS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenues:\nRoyalties $ 65,981 $ 65,753 $ 52,357\nFees 11,266 11,587 10,215\nProduct sales to franchisees 2,802 15,072 56,699\nAdvertising fund contributions 31,747 32,573 22,023\nFranchise rental income (Note 6) 111,441 130,777 127,392\nCompany-owned salon revenue 10,089 20,205 142,965\nTotal revenue 233,326 275,967 411,651\nOperating expenses:\nCost of product sales to franchisees 3,540 17,391 43,756\nInventory reserve 1,228 7,655 —\nGeneral and administrative 50,751 65,274 96,427\nRent (Note 6) 9,196 9,357 40,754\nAdvertising fund expense 31,747 32,573 22,023\nFranchise rent expense (Note 6) 111,441 130,777 127,392\nCompany-owned salon expense (1) 8,827 21,952 141,204\nDepreciation and amortization 7,716 6,224 21,749\nLong-lived asset impairment (Note 1) 101 542 13,023\nGoodwill impairment (Note 5) — 13,120 —\nTotal operating expenses 224,547 304,865 506,328\nOperating income (loss) 8,779 (28,898) (94,677)\nOther (expense) income:\nInterest expense (22,141) (12,914) (13,163)\nLoss from sale of salon assets to franchisees, net — (2,334) (16,696)\nOther, net 1,364 (296) 15,902\nLoss from operations before income taxes (11,998) (44,442) (108,634)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 655 (2,017) 5,428\nLoss from continuing operations (11,343) (46,459) (103,206)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations (Note 3) 3,958 (39,398) (10,125)\nNet loss $ (7,385) $ (85,857) $ (113,331)\nNet loss per share:\nBasic and diluted:\nLoss from continuing operations $ (0.25) $ (1.07) $ (2.87)\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations 0.09 (0.90) (0.28)\nNet loss per share, basic and diluted (2) $ (0.16) $ (1.97) $ (3.15)\nWeighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding:\nBasic and diluted 46,235 43,582 35,956\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Includes cost of service and product sold to guests in our company-owned salons.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness Description:\nRegis Corporation franchises and owns hair care salons, primarily in North America. The business is evaluated in two\nsegments, Franchise salons and Company-owned salons. Franchise salons in operation decreased from 5,395 at June 30, 2022\nto 4,795 at June 30, 2023, primarily due to the closure of 616 salons. Company-owned salons in operation decreased from 105\nat June 30, 2022 to 68 at June 30, 2023, primarily due to the closure of 37 salons. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. Salons are located in leased space in strip center locations, malls or Walmart.\nCOVID-19 Impact:\nThe global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) had an adverse impact on operations. As a result, the Company received\nCanadian rent relief, Canadian wage relief, U.S. employee retention payroll tax credits and a grant from the state of North\nCarolina. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company received the following assistance:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nFinancial Statement Caption (Dollars in thousands)\nCanadian rent relief Rent $ — $ 1,235 $ —\nCanadian wage relief Company-owned salon expense — 1,966 1,629\nU.S. employee retention payroll tax credit Company-owned salon expense — — 1,547\nNorth Carolina COVID-19 grant Other, net 1,106 — —\nAdditionally, in both December 2022 and December 2021, the Company paid $2.5 million of social security contributions that\nhad been deferred under the CARES Act.\nConsolidation:\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after the elimination of\nintercompany accounts and transactions. All material subsidiaries are wholly owned. The Company consolidates variable\ninterest entities where it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations.\nVariable Interest Entities:\nThe Company has interests in certain privately-held entities through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. Such\nentities, known as variable interest entities (VIE), are required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The Company\nevaluates whether it is the primary beneficiary for each VIE using a qualitative assessment that considers the VIE's purpose and\ndesign, the involvement of each of the interest holders and the risk and benefits of the VIE. As of June 30, 2023, the Company\nhas no VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary.\nThe Company has an investment in Empire Education Group, Inc. (EEG). During fiscal year 2020, the Company signed an\nagreement to sell its interest in EEG to the other shareholder. Until the transaction closes, the Company continues to account for\nEEG as an equity investment under the voting interest model. The Company has granted the other shareholder of EEG an\nirrevocable proxy to vote a certain number of the Company's shares such that the other shareholder of EEG has voting control\nof EEG's common stock, as well as the right to appoint four of the five members of EEG's Board of Directors. The Company\nwrote off its investment balance in EEG in fiscal year 2016.\n50\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results and outcomes may differ from\nmanagement's estimates and assumptions.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:\nCash equivalents consist of investments in short-term, highly liquid securities having original maturities of three months or less,\nwhich are made as a part of the Company's cash management activity. The carrying values of these assets approximate their fair\nmarket values. The Company primarily utilizes a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of\nlockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts that funds are moved to, and several \"zero balance\" disbursement\naccounts for funding of payroll and accounts payable. As a result of the Company's cash management system, checks issued,\nbut not presented to the banks for payment, may create negative book cash balances. There were no checks outstanding in\nexcess of related book cash balances at June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nRestricted cash within other current assets primarily relates to consolidated advertising cooperatives funds, which can only be\nused to settle obligations of the respective cooperatives and contractual obligations to collateralize the Company's self-\ninsurance programs. The self-insurance restricted cash arrangement can be canceled by the Company at any time if substituted\nwith letters of credit. The table below reconciles the cash and cash equivalents balances and restricted cash balances, recorded\nwithin other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\nreported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nJune 30,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 9,508 $ 17,041\nRestricted cash, included in other current assets 11,888 10,423\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 21,396 $ 27,464\n51\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts:\nThe receivable balance on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets primarily includes accounts and notes receivable from\nfranchisees, credit card receivables and receivables related to salons sold to franchisees. The balance is presented net of an\nallowance for expected losses (i.e., doubtful accounts), related to receivables from the Company's franchisees. The Company\nmonitors the financial condition of its franchisees and records provisions for estimated losses on receivables when it believes\nfranchisees are unable to make their required payments based on factors such as delinquencies and aging trends. The allowance\nfor doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses related to existing accounts and\nnotes receivables. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.3 and $6.6 million, respectively.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts increased in fiscal year 2023 due to an increase in past due receivables related to\nunderperforming franchise salons. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventories:\nInventories of finished goods consist principally of hair care products for retail product sales. A portion of inventories are also\nused for salon services consisting of hair color, hair care products including shampoo and conditioner and hair care treatments\nincluding permanents, neutralizers and relaxers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost\ndetermined on a weighted average cost basis.\nThe Company has inventory valuation reserves for excess and obsolete inventories, or other factors that may render inventories\nunmarketable at their historical costs. In fiscal year 2021, the Company announced it would transition away from its wholesale\nproduct distribution model in favor of a third-party distribution model. As a result, the Company exited its two distribution\ncenters in fiscal year 2022 and now stores inventory at a third-party facility. To facilitate the exit of the distribution centers, the\nCompany sold inventory at discounts. Additionally, the reduction in company-owned salons decreases the Company's ability to\nredistribute inventory from closed locations to other salons to be sold or used. The inventory valuation reserve as of June 30,\n2023 and 2022 was $1.5 and $1.9 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had inventory related to\ndiscontinued operations of $1.2 and $1.8 million, respectively, offset by a reserve of $1.2 and $1.1 million, respectively. See\nNote 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a total inventory reserve\ncharge of $1.2 million, which was recorded in inventory reserve in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal\nyear 2022, the Company recorded a total inventory reserve charge of $10.5 million, of which $7.7 and $2.8 million were\nrecorded in inventory reserve and company-owned salon expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a total inventory reserve charge of $12.1 million, which was recorded in\ncompany-owned salon expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProperty and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and\nequipment is computed using the straight-line method over their estimated useful asset lives (i.e., 10 years or lease life for\nimprovements and three to 10 years or lease life for equipment, furniture and software). Depreciation expense was $7.4, $5.8\nand $20.9 million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Depreciation expense for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021\nincludes $0.5, $1.0 and $4.7 million of asset retirement obligations, respectively, which are cash expenses.\nThe Company capitalizes both internal and external costs of developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Costs\nincurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are capitalized, while data conversion,\ntraining and maintenance costs associated with internal-use software are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives range\nfrom three to seven years.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals and betterments, which do not improve or extend the life of the\nrespective assets, are expensed. All other expenditures for renewals and betterments are capitalized. The assets and related\ndepreciation and amortization accounts are adjusted for property retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss\nincluded in operating income (loss). Fully depreciated or amortized assets remain in the accounts until retired from service.\n52\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRight of Use Asset, Lease Liabilities and Rent Expense:\nAt contract inception, the Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining whether it conveys the\nright to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. If the contract provides the Company the right to substantially\nall of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, the\nCompany considers it to be, or contain, a lease. The Company leases its company-owned salons and some of its corporate\nfacilities under operating leases. The original terms of the salon leases range from one to 11 years with many leases renewable\nfor an additional five to 10-year term at the option of the Company. In addition to the obligation to make fixed rental payments\nfor the use of the salons, the Company also has variable lease payments that are based on sales levels. For most leases, the\nCompany is required to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses.\nThe Company leases salon premises in which the majority of its franchisees operate and has entered into corresponding\nsublease arrangements with franchisees. All lease-related costs are passed through to franchisees. The Company records the\nrental payments due from franchisees as franchise rental income and the corresponding amounts owed to landlords as franchise\nrent expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAll of the Company's leases are operating leases. The lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value\nof the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, including one lease term option when the lease is expected to be\nrenewed. The right of use (ROU) asset is initially and subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount\nof the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, less any accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives received, if any.\nExpense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the lease renewal option when\nthe lease is expected to be renewed. Generally, the non-lease components, such as real estate taxes and other occupancy\nexpenses, are separate from rent expense within the lease and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability because\nthese charges are variable.\nThe discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company's estimated collateralized\nincremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as the interest rate implicit in the lease\ncannot generally be determined. The Company uses the portfolio approach in applying the discount rate based on the original\nlease term.\nCertain leases provide for contingent rents that are determined as a percentage of revenues in excess of specified levels. The\nCompany records a contingent rent liability in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, along with the\ncorresponding rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, when specified levels have been achieved or when\nmanagement determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable.\n53\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSalon Long-Lived Asset and Right of Use Asset Impairment Assessments:\nA lessee's ROU asset is subject to the same asset impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, applied to\nother elements of property, plant, and equipment. The Company has identified its asset groups at the individual salon level as\nthis represents the lowest level that identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets\nand liabilities. Poor salon performance in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in ASC 360-10-35-21 triggering events. As\na result, management assessed underperforming salon asset groups, which included the related ROU assets, for impairment in\naccordance with ASC 360.\nThe Company assesses impairment of long-lived salon assets and ROU assets at the individual salon level, as this is the lowest\nlevel for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities, when events or changes\nin circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable. Factors considered in\ndeciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of an individual salon in relation to\nexpectations, significant economic or geographic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.\nThe first step in the impairment test under ASC 360 is to determine whether the long-lived assets are recoverable, which is\ndetermined by comparing the net carrying value of the salon asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated\nfrom the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. Estimating cash flows for purposes of the recoverability test is\nsubjective and requires significant judgment. Estimated future cash flows used for the purposes of the recoverability test were\nbased upon historical cash flows for the salons, adjusted for expected changes in future market conditions and other factors. The\nperiod of time used to determine the estimates of the future cash flows for the recoverability test was based on the remaining\nuseful life of the primary asset of the group, which was the ROU asset in all cases.\nThe second step of the long-lived asset impairment test requires that the fair value of the asset group be estimated when\ndetermining the amount of any impairment loss. For the salon asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss\nwas measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company applied the\nfair value guidance within ASC 820-10 to determine the fair value of the asset group from the perspective of a market-\nparticipant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous\nmarket, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. To determine the fair value of the salon asset groups,\nthe Company utilized market-participant assumptions rather than the Company's own assumptions about how it intends to use\nthe asset group. The significant judgments and assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the salon asset groups include\nthe market rent of comparable properties and a discount rate. The fair value of the salon long-lived asset group is estimated\nusing market participant methods based on the best information available. The fair value of the ROU asset is estimated by\ndetermining what a market participant would pay over the life of the primary asset in the group, discounted back to June 30,\n2023.\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $0.1 and $0.5 million,\nrespectively, related to ROU assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal year 2021, the Company\nrecognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $13.0 million, which included $9.5 million related to ROU assets on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment loss for each salon asset group that was recognized was allocated\namong the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using their relative carrying amounts. Additionally, the impairment\nlosses did not reduce the carrying amount of an individual asset below its fair value, including the ROU assets included in the\nsalon asset groups. Assessing the long-lived assets for impairment requires management to make assumptions and to apply\njudgment which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. The Company does\nnot believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions it uses to\ncalculate impairment losses for its long-lived assets, including its ROU assets. If actual results are not consistent with the\nestimates and assumptions used in the calculations, the Company may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be\nmaterial. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nGoodwill:\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Franchise reporting unit had $173.8 and $174.4 million, respectively, of goodwill and the\nCompany-owned reporting unit had no goodwill for both periods. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nchanges to the goodwill balance. The Company assesses goodwill impairment on an annual basis as of April 30, and between\nannual assessments if an event occurs, or circumstances change, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its carrying amount.\nGoodwill impairment assessments are performed at the reporting unit level, which is the same as the Company's operating\nsegments. The goodwill assessment involves a one-step comparison of the reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value,\nincluding goodwill (Step 1). If the reporting unit's fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required.\nHowever, if the reporting unit's fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference\nbetween the fair value and carrying value of the reporting unit.\nIn applying the goodwill impairment assessment, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of the reporting units was less than its carrying value (Step 0). Qualitative factors could\ninclude, but are not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and overall financial performance of the\nreporting unit. If after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determined it is more likely than not that the carrying\nvalue is less than the fair value, then performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment assessment is unnecessary.\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting\nunit, including allocation of shared or corporate balances among reporting units. Allocations are generally based on the number\nof salons in each reporting unit as a percent of total salons or expenses of the reporting unit as a percent of total company\nexpenses.\nThe Company calculates estimated fair values of the reporting units based on discounted cash flows utilizing estimates in\nannual revenue, fixed expense rates, allocated corporate overhead, franchise and company-owned salon counts, and long-term\ngrowth rates for determining terminal value. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used in\nconjunction with the results of the discounted cash flows. The Company engages third-party valuation consultants to assist in\nevaluating the Company's estimated fair value calculations.\nThe following is a description of the goodwill impairment assessments for each of the fiscal years:\nFiscal 2023\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company did not experience any triggering events that required an interim goodwill analysis. The\nCompany performed its annual impairment assessment as of April 30. For the goodwill impairment analysis, management\nutilized a combination of both a discounted cash flows approach and market approach to evaluate the Franchise reporting unit.\nThe discounted cash flows model reflects management's assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, economic and market\ntrends, cost structure, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results. The discount rate\nof 17.0% was also a key assumption utilized in the discounted cash flows. The results of this assessment indicated that the\nestimated fair value of the Company's Franchise reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.\n55\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFiscal 2022\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test over goodwill during the second quarter due to\na triggering event experienced in the quarter. This determination was made considering the sustained decrease in share price\nand a change in the Company's chief operating decision maker. In the second quarter, the Franchise reporting unit was\ndetermined to have a fair value in excess of its carrying value and no impairment was recorded. A quantitative goodwill\nimpairment was performed in the third quarter due to a triggering event experienced during the quarter. This determination was\nmade considering a decrease in forecasted revenue due to slower than expected recovery from COVID-19. In the third quarter,\nthe Franchise reporting unit was determined to have a carrying value in excess of its fair value, resulting in a goodwill\nimpairment charge of $16.0 million.\nThe Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of April 30. For the goodwill impairment analysis, management\nutilized a combination of both a discounted cash flows approach and market approach to evaluate the Franchise reporting unit.\nThe discounted cash flows model reflects management's assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, economic and market\ntrends, cost structure, and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results. Management's\nassumptions related to revenue growth rates were reduced and management increased expected salon closures compared to\nvaluations in prior years. These changes, along with a decline in value from the market approach, reduced the fair value of the\nreporting unit. The discount rate of 20.0% was also a key assumption utilized in the discounted cash flows. As a result of the\nimpairment testing, the Franchise reporting unit was determined to have a fair value in excess of its carrying value.\nThe Company derecognized $38.4 million of goodwill in fiscal year 2022 in connection to the sale of OSP. The $38.4 million\nrepresents the portion of goodwill related to the OSP business based on relative fair value. See Notes 3 and 5 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nFiscal 2021\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not experience any triggering events that required an interim goodwill analysis. The\nCompany performed its annual impairment assessment as of April 30. For the fiscal year 2021 annual impairment assessment,\nthe Company performed a Step 1 impairment test for the Franchise reporting unit. The Company compared the carrying value\nof the Franchise reporting unit, including goodwill, to the estimated fair value. The results of this assessment indicated that the\nestimated fair value of the Company's Franchise reporting unit exceeded the carrying value.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals:\nThe Company uses a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance for a number of risks including workers'\ncompensation, health insurance, employment practice liability and general liability claims. The liability represents the\nCompany's estimate of the undiscounted ultimate cost of uninsured claims incurred as of the Consolidated Balance Sheets date.\nThe Company estimates self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, primarily based on independent third-party\nactuarially-determined amounts, historical claims experience, estimates of incurred but not reported claims, demographic\nfactors and severity factors.\nAlthough the Company does not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from the estimates, self-insurance\naccruals could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions. For\nfiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded decreases in expense for changes in estimates related to prior year\nopen policy periods of $1.4, $0.5 and $3.6 million, respectively. The Company updates loss projections bi-annually and adjusts\nits liability to reflect updated projections. The updated loss projections consider new claims and developments associated with\nexisting claims for each open policy period. As certain claims can take years to settle, the Company has multiple policy periods\nopen at any point in time.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had $3.6 and $7.3 million recorded in current liabilities and non-current liabilities,\nrespectively, related to the Company's workers' compensation and general liability self-insurance accruals. As of June 30, 2022,\nthe Company had $4.7 and $9.7 million recorded in current liabilities and non-current liabilities, respectively, related to the\nCompany's workers' compensation and general liability self-insurance accruals.\n56\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue:\nFranchise revenues primarily include royalties, fees, product sales to franchisees and advertising fund fees. Royalties and\nadvertising fund revenues represent sales-based royalties that are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sales occur.\nThe Company defers franchise fees until the salon is open and then recognizes the revenue over the term of the franchise\nagreement. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Product sales by the Company to its franchisees are recorded\nat the time product is delivered to franchise locations. Company-owned salon revenues are recognized at the time when the\nservices are provided, or the guest receives and pays for merchandise.\nClassification of Revenue and Expenses:\nBelow is a summary of the primary financial statement captions.\nRoyalties - Sales-based royalty received from franchisees.\nFees - Fees received from franchisees and third parties, including franchise fees and fees received from the third-party\ndistributor.\nProduct sales to franchisees - Wholesale product sales to franchisees. The Company changed its franchise product sales\nbusiness in fiscal year 2022 from a wholesale distribution model to a third-party distribution model. This revenue was expected\nto decrease significantly during fiscal year 2022 and into fiscal year 2023.\nAdvertising fund contributions - Sales-based advertising fund contributions received from franchisees.\nCompany-owned salon revenue - Service revenue and revenue derived from sales of product in Company-owned salons.\nCost of product sales to franchisees - Direct cost of inventory and freight and other costs of sales.\nCompany-owned salon expense - Cost of service and product sold to guests in our Company-owned salons and other salon-\nrelated costs. Excluded from this caption are general and administrative expense, rent and depreciation and amortization related\nto company-owned salons.\nConsideration Received from Vendors:\nThe Company receives consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs. These programs primarily include volume\nrebates and promotion and advertising reimbursements.\nWith respect to volume rebates, the Company estimates the amount of rebate it will receive and accrues it as a reduction to the\ncost of inventory over the period in which the rebate is earned based upon historical purchasing patterns and the terms of the\nvolume rebate program. A quarterly analysis is performed in order to ensure the estimated rebate accrued is reasonable and any\nnecessary adjustments are recorded.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDistribution Costs:\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company exited its two distribution centers and changed the wholesale product distribution model in\nfavor of a third-party distribution model, reducing the cost in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. Beginning in the second half of fiscal\nyear 2022, the Company began storing inventory at a third-party facility. Prior to closing the distribution centers in fiscal year\n2022, the Company incurred costs to store, move and ship product from the Company's distribution centers to salons.\nDistribution costs related to product shipped to company-owned locations are included in company-owned salon expenses in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations. Distribution costs, including distribution center overhead, related to shipping\nproduct to franchise locations totaled $0.0, $2.3 and $12.1 million during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and\nare included in general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdvertising and Advertising Funds:\nAdvertising costs consist of the Company's corporate funded advertising costs, the Company's advertising fund contributions\nand franchisee's advertising fund contributions. Corporate funded advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company has\nvarious franchising programs supporting specific franchise salon concepts. Most maintain advertising funds that provide\ncomprehensive advertising and sales promotion support. All salons are required to participate in the advertising funds for the\nsame salon concept. The Company administers the advertising funds in accordance with franchise operating and other\nagreements. Advertising fund contributions are expensed when the contribution is made.\nThe Company's advertising costs included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations consist of the following:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAdvertising fund contributions from franchisees $ 31,747 $ 32,573 $ 22,023\nAdvertising fund contributions from company-owned salons (1) 105 154 897\nCorporate funded advertising costs (1) 264 671 7,015\nTotal advertising costs $ 32,116 $ 33,398 $ 29,935\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Included in general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company records all advertising funds as assets and liabilities within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of\nJune 30, 2023 and 2022, approximately $11.1 and $10.5 million, respectively, representing the advertising funds' assets and\nliabilities, were recorded within total assets and total liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n58\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nStock-Based Employee Compensation Plans:\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date.\nCompensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award (or to the date a\nparticipant becomes eligible for retirement, if earlier). The Company uses fair value methods that require the input of subjective\nassumptions, including the expected term, expected volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate.\nThe Company estimates the likelihood and the rate of achievement for performance sensitive stock-based awards at the end of\neach reporting period. Changes in the estimated rate of achievement can have a significant effect on the recorded stock-based\ncompensation expense as the effect of a change in the estimated achievement level is recognized in the period the change\noccurs.\nInterest Expense:\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, management amended its credit agreement. The amended agreement contains variable\ninterest rates over the term of the debt. Therefore, management developed a weighted average effective interest rate by\nestimating total future cash flows related to the debt to determine interest expense in fiscal year 2023. The estimated cash flows\nincluded the margin rate, PIK interest, SOFR interest, and tenor fee applied to the forecasted outstanding debt balance in each\nfuture period. The significant assumptions used in the estimate are the future SOFR and debt balance, as well as the length of\ntime the debt will be outstanding. Management applied the weighted average rate to the debt balance to record interest expense\nfor the period. Due to the interest rate increases over the debt term, the Company recorded more interest expense than interest\npaid in cash in fiscal year 2023.\nOther, Net:\nIn March 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $15.0 million related to the Company's distribution centers. The gain on\ndistribution centers was recorded to other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in fiscal year 2021.\n59\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSales Taxes:\nSales taxes are recorded on a net basis (rather than as both revenue and an expense) within the Company's Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial Statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently\nenacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. The Company\nevaluates all evidence, including recent financial performance, the existence of cumulative year losses and our forecast of future\ntaxable income, to assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. While the determination of whether\nto record a valuation allowance is not fully governed by a specific objective test, accounting guidance places significant weight\non recent financial performance.\nThe Company has a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets of $202.2 and $201.7 million at June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded\namount, we would make necessary adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision\nfor income taxes.\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company determined that it no longer had sufficient U.S. state indefinite-lived taxable temporary\ndifferences to support realization of its U.S. state indefinite-lived NOLs and its existing U.S. deferred tax assets that upon\nreversal are expected to generate state indefinite-lived NOLs. As a result, the Company recorded a $4.1 million valuation\nallowance on its U.S. state indefinite-lived deferred tax assets.\nThe Company reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties related to anticipated tax audit positions in the U.S.\nand other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately\nproves to be unnecessary, the reversal of these liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it\nis determined that the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties\nproves to be less than the ultimate assessment, additional expenses would result.\nInherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of tax laws and published guidance\nwith respect to the Company's operations. Income tax expense is primarily the current tax payable for the period and the change\nduring the period in certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nSee Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n60\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNet Loss Per Share:\nThe Company's basic earnings per share is calculated as net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding,\nexcluding unvested outstanding stock awards. The Company's dilutive earnings per share is calculated as net income divided by\nweighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, which includes shares issuable under the\nCompany's stock option plan and long-term incentive plan and dilutive securities. Stock-based awards with exercise prices\ngreater than the average market value of the Company's common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings\nper share. Due to the Company's net loss in all periods presented, basic and dilutive earnings per share are equal.\nComprehensive Loss:\nComponents of comprehensive loss include net loss, foreign currency translation adjustments and recognition of deferred\ncompensation, net of tax within shareholders' deficit.\nForeign Currency Translation:\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the\nCompany's international operations are measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these\nsubsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each Consolidated Balance Sheets date. Translation adjustments\narising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in accumulated other comprehensive income\nwithin shareholders' deficit. Consolidated Statements of Operations accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange\nprevailing during the year. During fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a $0.3 million foreign currency\nloss, a $0.6 million foreign currency loss and a $0.3 million foreign currency gain in loss from continuing operations,\nrespectively, in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted by the Company:\nThe Company did not adopt any material accounting pronouncements during fiscal year 2023.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and it does not believe any of\nthese pronouncements will have a material impact to the Company's financial statements.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n2. REVENUE RECOGNITION:\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue:\nRevenue recognized over time\nRoyalty and advertising fund revenues represent sales-based royalties that are recognized in the period in which the sales occur.\nGenerally, royalty and advertising fund revenues are billed and collected monthly in arrears. Advertising fund revenues and\nexpenditures, which must be spent on marketing and related activities per the franchise agreements, are recorded on a gross\nbasis within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The treatment increases both the gross amount of reported revenue and\nexpense and generally has no impact on operating income and net income. Franchise fees are billed and received upon the\nsigning of the franchise agreement. Recognition of these fees is deferred until the salon opens and is then recognized over the\nterm of the franchise agreement, which is typically 10 years. Franchise rental income is a result of the Company signing leases\non behalf of franchisees and entering into sublease arrangements with the franchisees. The Company recognizes franchise rental\nincome and expense when it is due to the landlord.\nRevenue recognized at point of sale\nCompany-owned salon revenues are recognized at the time when the services are provided, or the guest receives and pays for\nthe merchandise. Revenues from purchases made with gift cards are also recorded when the guest takes possession of the\nmerchandise or services are provided. Gift cards issued by the Company are recorded as a liability (deferred revenue) upon sale\nand recognized as revenue upon redemption by the guest. Gift card breakage, the amount of gift cards which will not be\nredeemed, is recognized proportional to redemptions using estimates based on historical redemption patterns. Product sales to\nfranchisees are recorded at the time product is delivered to the franchisee.\nInformation about receivables, broker fees and deferred revenue subject to the revenue recognition guidance is as follows:\nJune 30, June 30,\n2023 2022 Balance Sheet Classification\n(Dollars in thousands)\nReceivables from contracts with customers, net $ 5,683 $ 10,263 Receivable, net\nBroker fees 12,471 15,592 Other assets\nDeferred revenue:\nCurrent\nGift card liability $ 1,823 $ 2,037 Accrued expenses\nDeferred franchise fees open salons 5,325 5,770 Accrued expenses\nTotal current deferred revenue $ 7,148 $ 7,807\nNon-current\nDeferred franchise fees unopened salons $ 2,312 $ 3,211 Other non-current liabilities\nDeferred franchise fees open salons 20,839 26,827 Other non-current liabilities\nTotal non-current deferred revenue $ 23,151 $ 30,038\n62\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nReceivables relate primarily to payments due for royalties, advertising fees, rent, franchise product sales and sales of salon\nservices and product paid by credit card.

LEASES\nAt contract inception, the Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease by determining whether it conveys the\nright to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. If the contract provides the Company the right to substantially\nall of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset, the\nCompany considers it to be, or contain, a lease. The Company leases its company-owned salons and some of its corporate\nfacilities under operating leases. The original terms of the salon leases range from one to 11 years with many leases renewable\nfor an additional five to 10-year term at the option of the Company. In addition to the obligation to make fixed rental payments\nfor the use of the salons, the Company also has variable lease payments that are based on sales levels. For most leases, the\nCompany is required to pay real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses. Total rent from continuing operations includes the\nfollowing:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOffice and warehouse rent $ 3,594 $ 4,575 $ 5,234\nLease termination expense (1) 1,627 1,835 13,544\nLease liability benefit (2) (1,773) (3,620) (20,022)\nFranchise salon rent 2,109 1,695 3,376\nCompany-owned salon rent 3,639 4,872 38,622\nTotal $ 9,196 $ 9,357 $ 40,754\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) During fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred costs of $1.6 million to exit salons before the lease end date in order to\nrelieve the company of future lease obligations. During fiscal year 2022, lease termination expense includes\n$0.9 million to exit the Company's distribution centers before the lease end dates and $0.9 million to exit salons before\nthe lease end dates in order to relieve the Company of future lease obligations. During fiscal year 2021, lease\ntermination fees include $8.3 million of early termination payments to close salons before the lease end date to relieve\nthe Company of future lease obligations and $5.3 million to accrue future lease payments for salons that are no longer\noperating.\n(2) Upon termination of previously impaired leases, the Company derecognizes the corresponding ROU assets and lease\nliabilities which results in a net gain. In addition, the Company recognizes a benefit from lease liabilities decreasing in\nexcess of previously impaired ROU assets for ongoing leases that were previously impaired.\nThe Company leases salon premises in which the majority of its franchisees operate and has entered into corresponding\nsublease arrangements with franchisees. All lease-related costs are passed through to the franchisees. The Company records the\nrental payments due from franchisees as franchise rental income and the corresponding amounts owed to landlords as franchise\nrent expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, franchise rental income and\nfranchise rent expense were $111.4, $130.8 and $127.4 million, respectively. These leases generally have lease terms of\napproximately five years. The Company expects to renew the SmartStyle master lease and some leases for locations subleased\nto our franchisees upon expiration of those leases. Other leases are expected to be renewed by the franchisee upon expiration.\nAll the Company's leases are operating leases. The lease liability is initially and subsequently measured at the present value of\nthe unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, including one lease term option when the lease is expected to be\nrenewed. The ROU asset is initially and subsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease\nliability, plus initial direct costs, less any accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives received, if any. Expense for\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the lease renewal option when the lease is\nexpected to be renewed. Generally, the non-lease components, such as real estate taxes and other occupancy expenses, are\nseparate from rent expense within the lease and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability because these charges\nare variable.\nThe discount rate used to determine the present value of the lease payments is the Company's estimated collateralized\nincremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the respective lease terms, as the interest rate implicit in the lease\ncannot generally be determined. The Company uses the portfolio approach in applying the discount rate based on the original\nlease term. The weighted average remaining lease term was 5.52 years and 6.02 years and the weighted average discount rate\nwas 4.55% and 4.25% for all salon operating leases as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA lessee's ROU asset is subject to the same asset impairment guidance in ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, applied to\nother elements of property, plant, and equipment. The Company has identified its asset groups at the individual salon level as\nthis represents the lowest level that identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets\nand liabilities. Poor salon performance in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 resulted in ASC 360-10-35-21 triggering events. As\na result, management assessed underperforming salon asset groups, which included the related ROU assets, for impairment in\naccordance with ASC 360.\nThe first step in the impairment test under ASC 360 is to determine whether the long-lived assets are recoverable, which is\ndetermined by comparing the net carrying value of the salon asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated\nfrom the use and eventual disposition of that asset group. Estimating cash flows for purposes of the recoverability test is\nsubjective and requires significant judgment. Estimated future cash flows used for the purposes of the recoverability test were\nbased upon historical cash flows for the salons, adjusted for expected changes in future market conditions related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and other factors. The period of time used to determine the estimates of the future cash flows for the\nrecoverability test was based on the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the group, which was the ROU asset in all\ncases.\nThe second step of the long-lived asset impairment test requires that the fair value of the asset group be estimated when\ndetermining the amount of any impairment loss. For the salon asset groups that failed the recoverability test, an impairment loss\nwas measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Company applied the\nfair value guidance within ASC 820-10 to determine the fair value of the asset group from the perspective of a market-\nparticipant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous\nmarket, and assumptions about the highest and best use of the asset group. To determine the fair value of the salon asset groups,\nthe Company utilized market-participant assumptions rather than the Company's own assumptions about how it intends to use\nthe asset group. The significant judgments and assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the salon asset groups include\nthe market rent of comparable properties and a discount rate.\nThe fair value of the salon long-lived asset group is estimated using market participant methods based on the best information\navailable. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist with the research related to inputs used in their\ndetermination of the fair value of the ROU asset which included providing information related to significant inputs and\nassumptions utilized in the measurement of the impairment loss.\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $0.1 and $0.5 million,\nrespectively, related to ROU assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal year 2021, the Company\nrecognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $13.0 million, which included $9.5 million related to ROU assets on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment loss for each salon asset group that was recognized was allocated\namong the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using their relative carrying amounts. Additionally, the impairment\nlosses did not reduce the carrying amount of an individual asset below its fair value, including for the ROU assets included in\nthe salon asset groups. Assessing the long-lived assets for impairment requires management to make assumptions and to apply\njudgment, which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict. The Company does\nnot believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions it uses to\ncalculate impairment losses for its long-lived asset, including its ROU assets. If actual results are not consistent with the\nestimates and assumptions used in the calculations, the Company may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be\nmaterial.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs of June 30, 2023, future operating lease commitments, including one renewal option for leases expected to be renewed, to be\npaid and received by the Company were as follows (in thousands):\nLeases For Total Sublease\nLeases For Company- Operating Income to be\nFranchise Owned Corporate Lease Received From Net Rent\nFiscal Year Salons Salons Leases Commitments Franchisees Commitments\n2024 $ 93,838 $ 1,629 $ 1,301 $ 96,768 $ (93,838) $ 2,930\n2025 78,344 677 1,334 80,355 (78,344) 2,011\n2026 64,992 458 1,367 66,817 (64,992) 1,825\n2027 55,273 229 1,401 56,903 (55,273) 1,630\n2028 46,758 218 1,436 48,412 (46,758) 1,654\nThereafter 70,053 56 2,981 73,090 (70,053) 3,037\nTotal future obligations $ 409,258 $ 3,267 $ 9,820 $ 422,345 $ (409,258) $ 13,087\nLess amounts representing interest 46,970 240 1,317 48,527\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 362,288 $ 3,027 $ 8,503 $ 373,818\nLess current lease liabilities 79,420 1,526 971 81,917\nLong-term lease liabilities $ 282,868 $ 1,501 $ 7,532 $ 291,901\nSupplemental operating cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (1) $ 57,598 $ 74,507 $ 130,039\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities 458 2,011 4,242\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities includes rent, termination fees, settlements and\nlegal fees, and commission payments.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value measurements are categorized into one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1\n(unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs available at the measurement date, other than\nquoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables,\ninventory, deferred compensation assets, debt and accounts payable approximated their carrying values.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe measure certain assets, including the Company's equity method investments, tangible fixed and other assets, and goodwill,\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. The fair values of these assets\nare determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted\nmarket prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.\nThe following impairment charges were based on fair values using Level 3 inputs (1):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nGoodwill impairment $ — $ 16,000 $ —\nLong-lived asset impairment 101 542 13,023\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) See Notes 1 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n72\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nThe Company's financing arrangements consists of the following:\nJune 30,\nMaturity Date 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(Fiscal year) (Interest rate %) (Dollars in thousands)\nTerm loan 2026 9.54% N/A $ 172,268 $ —\nDeferred financing fees (6,471) —\nTerm loan, net 165,797 —\nRevolving credit facility 2026 9.54% 5.50% 10,000 179,994\nPaid-in-kind interest 1,033 —\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 176,830 $ 179,994\nIn August 2022, the Company amended its credit agreement. The amendment, among other things, converted $180.0 million of\nthe previous $295.0 million revolving credit facility to a new term loan, reduced commitments under the revolving credit\nfacility to $55.0 million, and extended the term of the credit facility from March 26, 2023 to August 31, 2025, with no\nscheduled amortization prior to maturity. The amendment is accounted for as a modification of debt and any unamortized\nfinancing fees that existed at the date of the amendment and new financing fees incurred are amortized through the extended\nterm of the credit facility. At June 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding standby letters of credit under the revolving credit\nfacility of $11.8 million, primarily related to the Company's self-insurance program. As of June 30, 2023, the total liquidity and\navailable credit under the revolving credit facility, as defined by the agreement, were $42.8 and $33.3 million, respectively. As\nof June 30, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.5 million and current liabilities of $126.3 million.\nThe agreement utilizes an interest rate margin that is subject to annual increases. The margin applicable to term secured\novernight financing rate (SOFR) loans was 3.875% through March 27, 2023. Effective March 27, 2023, the margin increased to\n6.25%, of which 4.25% is paid currently in cash and 2.00% is PIK interest (added to the principal balance and thereafter\naccruing interest). Effective March 27, 2024, the margin will increase to 7.25%, of which 4.25% will be paid currently in cash\nand 3.00% will be PIK interest. The margin applicable to base rate loans will be 100 basis points (1.00%) less than the margin\napplicable to term SOFR loans. Interest expense is recorded based on a weighted average effective interest rate method. The\nsignificant assumptions used in the weighted average estimate are the future SOFR rates and debt balance, as well as the length\nof time the debt will be outstanding. Due to the interest rate increasing over the debt term, the Company recorded more interest\nexpense than interest paid in cash in fiscal year 2023. The related accrued interest of $3.8 million as of June 30, 2023 is\nincluded in accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe agreement contains typical provisions and financial covenants regarding minimum EBITDA, maximum leverage and\nminimum fixed-charge coverage and a minimum liquidity threshold of $10.0 million. The Company was in compliance with its\ncovenants and other requirements of the financing arrangements as of June 30, 2023.\n73\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nContingencies:\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company was self-insured for most workers' compensation, employment practice liability and general\nliability. Workers' compensation and general liability losses are subject to per occurrence and aggregate annual liability\nlimitations. The Company is insured for losses in excess of these limitations. The Company is also self-insured for health care\nclaims for eligible participating employees subject to certain deductibles and limitations. The Company determines its liability\nfor claims incurred but not reported on an actuarial basis. Beginning in fiscal year 2024, the Company transitioned to a third-\nparty insurance plan for new workers' compensation and general liability claims.\nLitigation and Settlements:\nThe Company is a plaintiff or defendant in various lawsuits and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Like\ncertain other franchisors, the Company has faced allegations of franchise regulation and agreement violations. Additionally,\nbecause the Company may be the tenant under a master lease for a location subleased to a franchisee, the Company has faced\nallegations of nonpayment of rent and associated charges. Further, similar to other large retail employers, the Company has\nfaced, and may continue to face, allegations of purported class-wide consumer and wage and hour violations.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded $1.0 million of expense related to litigation and paid $1.5 million settlements of\nclaims during the year. Legal costs are expensed as incurred. During fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded $2.2 million of\nexpense related to litigation, of which $1.7 million was paid during the year.\nThe Company's previous point-of-sale system supplier had challenged the development of certain parts of the Company's\ntechnology systems in litigation brought in the Northern District of California. The Company and the supplier entered into an\nagreement, effective June 25, 2021, that provided for the dismissal of the lawsuit and set forth a Transition Services Agreement\npursuant to which the supplier will assist in the transfer of franchise salons from its point-of-sale system to the Company's salon\nmanagement system, OSP. The Company and the supplier entered into an amendment to the Settlement Agreement, effective\nJune 15, 2022, in which the Company agreed to pay $2.0 million to the supplier in installments commencing on June 15, 2022,\nand ending on December 10, 2022, in consideration of a release of claims arising out of or related to the Transition Services\nAgreement and for the supplier to continue to provide the services set forth in that agreement. As of June 30, 2023, the\nCompany has made all payments under the agreement.\nLitigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined. Although the actions\nare being vigorously defended, the Company could incur judgments in the future or enter into settlements of claims that could\nhave a material adverse effect on its results of operations in any particular period.\n74\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n10.

The Company's federal loss carryforward consists of $27.3\nmillion that will expire from fiscal years 2034 to 2038 and $90.8 million that has no expiration. The state loss carryforwards\nconsist of $24.4 million that will expire from fiscal years 2024 to 2043 and $3.5 million that has no expiration. The Canada loss\ncarryforward will expire from fiscal years 2036 to 2043. The U.K. loss carryforward has no expiration.\nThe Company's tax credit carryforward of $37.5 million primarily consists of Work Opportunity Tax Credits that will expire\nfrom fiscal years 2031 to 2043.\nThe Company's capital loss carryforward of $5.8 million will expire in fiscal year 2025.\nWe consider the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Accordingly, we have not\nrecorded deferred taxes related to the U.S. federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately\n$6.6 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which have been reinvested outside the U.S. As a result of the\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, taxes payable on the remittance of such earnings is expected to be minimal.\nThe Company files tax returns and pays tax primarily in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., as well as states, cities, and provinces\nwithin these jurisdictions. With limited exceptions, due to net operating loss carryforwards, the Company's federal, state and\nforeign tax returns are open to examination for all years since 2014, 2012 and 2016, respectively.\nA rollforward of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of period $ 22,173 $ 13,858\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 10 8,636\n(Reductions) additions based on tax positions of prior years (663) 81\nReductions on tax positions related to the expiration of the statute of limitations (127) (402)\nBalance at end of period $ 21,393 $ 22,173\nIf the Company were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded, a net benefit of approximately $0.9 million would be\nrecorded in the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income\ntax expense. The Company recorded interest and penalties of approximately $0.1, $0.2 and $0.2 million as reductions to the\naccrual, net of the respective reversal of previously accrued interest and penalties during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of\n$0.6 million. This amount is not included in the gross unrecognized tax benefits noted above.\nIt is reasonably possible the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of our unrecognized tax positions\nwill increase or decrease during the next fiscal year. However, an estimate of the amount or range of the change cannot be made\nat this time.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA) was signed into law. The IRA contains a number of tax related\nprovisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations, as well as an excise tax on stock\nrepurchases. The Company has evaluated the IRA and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n77\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n11. BENEFIT PLANS\nRegis Retirement Savings Plan:\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, the Regis Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company's basic earnings per share is calculated as net loss divided by weighted average common shares outstanding,\nexcluding unvested outstanding stock options (SOs), outstanding stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs)\nand stock-settled performance units (PSUs). The Company's diluted earnings per share is calculated as net income divided by\nweighted average common shares and common share equivalents outstanding, which includes shares issued under the\nCompany's stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based awards with exercise prices greater than the average market price of\nthe Company's common stock are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. As the Company is in a net loss\nposition, basic earnings per share is equivalent to dilutive earnings per share.\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, 492,715, 608,503 and 636,310 common stock equivalents of dilutive common stock,\nrespectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation due to net loss from continuing operations.\nThe computation of weighted average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, excluded the following stock-based awards as they\nwere not dilutive under the treasury stock method:\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nEquity-based compensation awards 3,955,941 2,269,335 2,322,006\n80\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company grants long-term equity-based awards under the 2018 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan). The 2018 Plan,\nwhich was approved by the Company's shareholders at its 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, provides for the granting of\nnonqualified SOs, equity-based SARs and cash-settled SARs, RSUs and PSUs, to employees and non-employee directors of the\nCompany. Under the 2018 Plan, a maximum of 3,818,895 shares are approved for issuance. The 2018 Plan incorporates a\nfungible share design, under which full value awards (such as RSUs and PSUs) count against the shares reserved for issuance at\na rate 2.0 times higher than appreciation awards (such as SARs and SOs). As of June 30, 2023, a maximum of 1,481,215 shares\nwere available for grant under the 2018 Plan. All unvested awards are subject to forfeiture in the event of termination of\nemployment, unless accelerated. SAR and RSU awards granted under the 2018 Plan generally include various acceleration\nterms, including upon retirement for participants aged 62 years or older or who are aged 55 years or older and have 15 years of\ncontinuous service.\nThe Company also has outstanding awards under the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan), although the 2016 Plan\nterminated in October 2018 and no additional awards have since been or will be made under the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan\nprovided for the granting of SARs, restricted stock awards (RSAs), RSUs and PSUs, as well as cash-based performance grants,\nto employees and non-employee directors of the Company.\nThe Company also has outstanding awards under the Amended and Restated 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan),\nalthough the 2004 Plan terminated in October 2016 and no additional awards have since been or will be made under the 2004\nPlan. The 2004 Plan provided for the granting of nonqualified SOs, SARs, RSAs, RSUs and PSUs, as well as cash-based\nperformance grants, to employees and non-employee directors of the Company.\nUnder the 2018 Plan, 2016 Plan and the 2004 Plan, stock-based awards are granted at an exercise price or initial value equal to\nthe fair market value on the date of grant. The fair value of cash-settled SARs granted in fiscal year 2022 are re-valued on a\nquarterly basis.\nUsing the fair value of each grant on the date of grant, the weighted average fair values per stock-based compensation award\ngranted during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (1):\nFiscal Years\n2023 2022 2021\nSARs $ 1.52 $ 2.56 $ —\nSOs 1.43 1.82 2.89\nRSUs — 2.69 7.15\nPSUs — — 5.83\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) The fair value of cash-settled SARs granted are estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes valuation model,\nwith the fair value recalculated on a quarterly basis. The fair value of market-based SOs granted are estimated on the\ndate of grant using either a Monte Carlo valuation model or a Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of\nmarket-based RSUs and PSUs granted are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

Segment\ninformation is presented on the same basis that the Company internally organizes the business for assessing performance and\nmaking decisions regarding allocation of resources. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company revised its internal\nreporting such that the Chief Operating Decision Maker's (CODM) primary measures of segment performance are revenue and\nsegment adjusted EBITDA. Revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA are regularly reviewed by the CODM to make decisions\nabout resources to be allocated to the segments, assess current performance and forecast future performance. The Company's\nCODM does not evaluate reportable segments using assets and capital expenditure information. Segment adjusted EBITDA is\ndefined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment.\nConsistent with our internal management reporting, unallocated expenses include certain items impacting comparability. These\nunallocated items are not defined terms within U.S. GAAP. They are based on how management views the business, makes\nfinancial, operating and planning decisions and evaluates the Company's ongoing performance and are not attributable to either\nsegment. Unallocated fees include distribution center wind down fees, inventory reserve, one-time professional fees and\nsettlements, severance expense, the benefit from lease liability decreases in excess of previously impaired ROU assets, lease\ntermination fees, asset retirement obligation costs and goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. Figures for prior\nreporting periods have been restated to conform to the current period.\nThe Franchise reportable operating segment is comprised of 4,795 franchise salons located mainly in strip center locations and\nWalmart. Franchise salons offer high quality, convenient and value priced hair care and beauty services and retail products.\nThis segment operates primarily in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada and primarily includes the Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost\nCutters, First Choice Haircutters, Roosters and Magicuts concepts.\nThe Company-owned salons reportable operating segment is comprised of 68 company-owned salons located mainly in strip\ncenter locations and Walmart.
