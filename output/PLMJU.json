When formulating its Board membership recommendations, the\nNominating Committee will consider advice and recommendations from\nshareholders, management, and others as it deems appropriate, and will\nalso take into account the performance of incumbent directors in\ndetermining whether to recommend them to stand for reelection at the\nannual meeting of shareholders.\n(ii) After the completion of interviews (including, as appropriate, with other\nBoard members, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior\nmanagement) and reference checks of identified candidates, the Nominating\nCommittee will meet in person or by conference call to discuss and make\nrecommendations to the Board with respect to the candidates. The full\nBoard will then vote on the committee’s recommendations. Those\ncandidates approved by a majority of the Board shall be nominated for\nelection by the Company’s shareholders at the next annual meeting.\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company will contact any candidate(s)\nso approved, invite them to attend the Company’s annual meeting and to join the Board at its first\nmeeting thereafter, if they are elected by the Company’s shareholders at the annual meeting. In the\ncase of a Board candidate appointed between annual meetings, the same nominating process will\ngenerally apply except that the approved candidate will be invited to join the Board at its next\nmeeting after his or her approval by the Board.\n(d) Director Terms\nSubject to any rights of the holders of any series of preference shares to elect additional\ndirectors under specified circumstances, the directors of the Company shall be divided into three\nclasses as nearly equal in size as is practicable, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term\nof office of the initial Class I directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders\noccurring after the Company’s initial public offering, the term of office of the initial Class II\ndirectors shall expire at the second annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s\ninitial public offering, and the term of office of the initial Class III directors shall expire at the third\nannual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial public offering. At each\nannual meeting after the first annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial\npublic offering, each director elected to the class of directors expiring at such annual meeting shall\nbe elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until his or her successor\nshall have been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or\nretirement.\n5\nDirectors who are appointed by third parties having the right to appoint one or more Board\nmembers shall be subject to the terms of appointment established by such third party pursuant to\nits legal rights with the Company.\n(e) Change of Position\nThe Board does not believe that directors who retire or change the position they held when\nthey became a member of the Board should necessarily leave the Board. Promptly following such\nevent, the director must notify the Nominating Committee, which shall review the continued\nappropriateness of the affected director remaining on the Board under the circumstances. The\naffected director is expected to act in accordance with the Nominating Committee’s\nrecommendation following such review.\n(f) Limitations on Board Service\nThe Board does not believe that its members should generally be prohibited from serving\non boards and/or committees of other organizations, and the Board has not adopted any guidelines\nlimiting such activities. However, prior to becoming a director of another public company, a\ndirector of the Company shall notify the Chairman of the Nominating Committee, the Chairman\nof the Board and Chief Executive Officer to address whether the aggregate number of directorships\nheld by such director would interfere with his or her ability to carry out his or her responsibilities\nas a director of the Company. (Additionally, the Audit Committee will be informed if there is\nconcern that any directorship with another company might create a conflict of interest.) In the\nevent that the Board determines that the additional directorship constitutes a conflict of interest or\ninterferes with such director’s ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a director of the\nCompany, such director, upon the request of the Board, shall either offer his or her resignation or\nnot accept the other directorship.\n4.

The Company shall pay the professional fees and reasonable\nexpenses of any such independent advisors retained by the Board or any of its committees.\n5. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe Compensation Committee shall establish the amount and form of compensation to be\npaid to Company directors. In making its recommendations, the Compensation Committee shall\nconsider the director compensation policies at the Company’s competitors and other comparable\ncompanies to ensure that the total compensation the Company pays to its directors is reasonable.\nThe Board shall review its directors’ compensation policy annually. Members of management who\nare also members of the Board shall not receive any additional compensation for their service as\ndirectors, committee members or committee chairmen.\n6.

The Chief Executive Officer shall also provide the Board with an assessment of\npotential successors to key executive positions within the Company.\n8.

BOARD OPERATIONS\n(a) Board Size\nThe number of directors which shall constitute the Board shall be fixed from time to time\nin accordance with the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association of the Company\nthen in effect.\n2\n(b) Board Independence\nIt is the Board’s policy that a majority of the directors will be “independent” as that term\nis defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”); provided, that\npursuant to the exemption provided to “controlled companies” by the listing standards of the\nNasdaq, for such time that the Company qualifies as a controlled company, as well as any phase-\nin period for listing in conjunction with an initial public offering, the Company shall not be\nrequired to comply with such director independence requirements. The Board may also examine\nother factors that will contribute to effective oversight and decision-making by the Board,\nprovided, however, that so long as the Company is subject to Nasdaq rules and regulations, the\nCompany will meet any requirements therein, including with respect to director independence.\n(c) Board Meetings\nThe Board plans to hold four regular meetings each year and may hold additional or special\nmeetings whenever necessary, but may hold fewer prior to the Company’s initial business\ncombination. Regular Board meetings and special meetings may be held either in person or by\nconference call.

Directors are expected to have reviewed and be prepared to discuss all materials\ndistributed in advance of any meeting.\n(f) Board Committees\nThe Board currently has the following standing committees: Audit Committee, Nominating\nCommittee and Compensation Committee. The committees’ charters are posted on the Company’s\nwebsite. From time to time, the Board may form a new committee or disband a current committee\ndepending on the circumstances. Each committee will comply with the independence and other\nrequirements established by applicable law and regulations, including Securities and Exchange\nCommission and Nasdaq rules, within any required timeframes.\nThe Nominating Committee may make recommendations to the Board relative to\ncommittee members and chairmen consistent with the membership criteria outlined in the\napplicable committee charter. Committee appointments are subject to approval of the majority of\n3\nthe full Board. The Board may replace any committee chairs or members or add additional\nmembers to a Board committee at any time during the year.\nMembers of all standing committees are appointed by the Board. The Board determines\nthe exact number of members and can at any time remove or replace a committee member. The\nchair of each committee of the Board will, in consultation with appropriate committee members\nand members of management, and in accordance with the committee’s charter, determine the\nfrequency and length of committee meetings and develop the committee’s agenda.\n(g) Separate Sessions of Independent Directors\nNASDAQ rules require independent Board members to meet in regularly scheduled\nexecutive sessions without non-independent directors. The Board’s policy is to hold executive\nsessions without the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and other\nnon- independent directors, in connection with each regularly scheduled Board meeting or as is\notherwise required by NASDAQ rules and regulations, and at other times as necessary.\nCommittees of the Board may also meet in executive session as deemed appropriate.\n3. DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND BOARD COMPOSITION\n(a) Director Criteria\nThe Company seeks to align Board composition with the Company’s strategic direction so\nthat Board members bring skills, experience and backgrounds that are relevant to the key strategic\nand operational issues that they will oversee and approve. Director candidates are typically\nselected based for their integrity and character, sound, independent judgment, track record of\naccomplishment in leadership roles, as well as their professional and corporate expertise, skills\nand experience. Criteria that are typically considered by the Board in the selection of directors\ninclude:\n(i) should have demonstrated notable or significant achievements in business,\neducation or public service;\n(ii) should possess the requisite intelligence, education and experience to make\na significant contribution to the board of directors and bring a range of\nskills, diverse perspectives and backgrounds to its deliberations; and\n(iii) should have the highest ethical standards, a strong sense of professionalism\nand intense dedication to serving the interests of the shareholders.\n(b) Regulatory Requirements\nThe Nominating Committee reviews Board and committee composition at least annually\nto ensure that the Company complies with NASDAQ and any other regulatory requirements. In\nso doing, the Nominating Committee conducts a review of the independence of all members of\nthe Board for the purposes of determining whether Board members are “independent” under\napplicable NASDAQ rules and regulations. Board members must notify the Chairman of the\nNominating Committee, as soon as practicable, in the event that their circumstances change in a\nmanner that may impact the committee’s view of their independence.\n4\n(c) Nominating Process\nThe nominating process outlined herein applies only with respect to the nomination of\ndirector candidates who will be presented to the Company’s shareholders for election at the annual\nmeeting, if any. Where a third party has the right to propose for nomination one or more directors\nto the Company’s Board, the selection and nomination of such directors need not be subject to this\nprocess.\n(i) The Nominating Committee is responsible for screening and\nrecommending to the Board nominees for election as directors of the\nCompany, including nominees recommended by shareholders of the\nCompany. When formulating its Board membership recommendations, the\nNominating Committee will consider advice and recommendations from\nshareholders, management, and others as it deems appropriate, and will\nalso take into account the performance of incumbent directors in\ndetermining whether to recommend them to stand for reelection at the\nannual meeting of shareholders.\n(ii) After the completion of interviews (including, as appropriate, with other\nBoard members, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior\nmanagement) and reference checks of identified candidates, the Nominating\nCommittee will meet in person or by conference call to discuss and make\nrecommendations to the Board with respect to the candidates. The full\nBoard will then vote on the committee’s recommendations. Those\ncandidates approved by a majority of the Board shall be nominated for\nelection by the Company’s shareholders at the next annual meeting.\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company will contact any candidate(s)\nso approved, invite them to attend the Company’s annual meeting and to join the Board at its first\nmeeting thereafter, if they are elected by the Company’s shareholders at the annual meeting. In the\ncase of a Board candidate appointed between annual meetings, the same nominating process will\ngenerally apply except that the approved candidate will be invited to join the Board at its next\nmeeting after his or her approval by the Board.\n(d) Director Terms\nSubject to any rights of the holders of any series of preference shares to elect additional\ndirectors under specified circumstances, the directors of the Company shall be divided into three\nclasses as nearly equal in size as is practicable, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The term\nof office of the initial Class I directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders\noccurring after the Company’s initial public offering, the term of office of the initial Class II\ndirectors shall expire at the second annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s\ninitial public offering, and the term of office of the initial Class III directors shall expire at the third\nannual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial public offering. At each\nannual meeting after the first annual meeting of shareholders occurring after the Company’s initial\npublic offering, each director elected to the class of directors expiring at such annual meeting shall\nbe elected to hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting and until his or her successor\nshall have been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or\nretirement.\n5\nDirectors who are appointed by third parties having the right to appoint one or more Board\nmembers shall be subject to the terms of appointment established by such third party pursuant to\nits legal rights with the Company.\n(e) Change of Position\nThe Board does not believe that directors who retire or change the position they held when\nthey became a member of the Board should necessarily leave the Board. Promptly following such\nevent, the director must notify the Nominating Committee, which shall review the continued\nappropriateness of the affected director remaining on the Board under the circumstances. The\naffected director is expected to act in accordance with the Nominating Committee’s\nrecommendation following such review.\n(f) Limitations on Board Service\nThe Board does not believe that its members should generally be prohibited from serving\non boards and/or committees of other organizations, and the Board has not adopted any guidelines\nlimiting such activities. However, prior to becoming a director of another public company, a\ndirector of the Company shall notify the Chairman of the Nominating Committee, the Chairman\nof the Board and Chief Executive Officer to address whether the aggregate number of directorships\nheld by such director would interfere with his or her ability to carry out his or her responsibilities\nas a director of the Company. (Additionally, the Audit Committee will be informed if there is\nconcern that any directorship with another company might create a conflict of interest.) In the\nevent that the Board determines that the additional directorship constitutes a conflict of interest or\ninterferes with such director’s ability to carry out his or her responsibilities as a director of the\nCompany, such director, upon the request of the Board, shall either offer his or her resignation or\nnot accept the other directorship.\n4. DIRECTOR ACCESS TO MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT ADVISORS\n(a) Access to Management\nDirectors shall have full and unrestricted access to any relevant Company records and may\nrequest that any officer or other employee of the Company or the Company’s outside counsel or\naccountants meet with any members of, or consultants to, the Board or any committee.
