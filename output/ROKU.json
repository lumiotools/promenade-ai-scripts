The Roku operating system (OS) has been\nthe #1 selling TV OS in the U.S. for more than five years. In Q3, sales of TV units powered by the Roku OS were greater\nthan those of the #2 and #3 selling TV operating systems combined2. The Roku OS was also the #1 selling TV OS in\nMexico and Canada3, where we continue to grow scale. We have broad retail distribution of Roku streaming devices,\nincluding Roku-branded TVs, which are available from popular national retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Sam’s\nClub, Target, and Walmart.\nOur world-class teams are always working to improve the streaming experience our devices deliver. In September,\nwe launched our most powerful streaming player to date: the 2024 Roku Ultra. This premium streaming player comes\nbundled with the Voice Remote Pro (2nd edition), our most advanced remote. Tom’s Guide said, “From the new\nbacklit buttons to being able to charge via USB-C, Roku’s latest remote is now almost perfect.”4 The 2024 Roku Ultra\nhas a new quad core processor that delivers 30% faster performance, quicker streaming app launches, and upgraded\nWi-Fi 6 radio architecture. CNET referred to the new Ultra as “undoubtedly the best Roku yet.”5\nDriving Viewer Engagement\nGlobally, our users streamed 32.0 billion hours in Q3, up 20% YoY. We also grew engagement per household globally,\nwith average Streaming Hours per Streaming Household per day of 4.1 hours in Q3 2024, up from 3.9 hours in Q3\n2023. On traditional TV, average viewing time per U.S. household per day was 7.0 hours (Nielsen), highlighting the\nsignificant opportunity for us to continue to grow our engagement.\nViewer Experience\nThe Roku experience begins with our Home Screen. Its powerful position as the lead-in to TV drives engagement that\nbenefits our viewers, content partners, advertisers, and therefore Roku.\nFor example, the Roku Sports Zone is a feature on our Home Screen that aggregates and organizes sports\nprogramming across our platform into a single destination. As Q3 was a busy season for sports fans, we worked to\nmake finding what games to watch easier for them. Within the Roku Sports Zone, we created designated zones for\nthe MLB, the Olympics, and the NFL. We also surfaced events in our UI outside of the Sports Zone in features like\nWhat to Watch. In Q3, households that started streaming from one of these Sports Zone features increased 68% QoQ,\nand the number of Streaming Hours attributed to these features doubled QoQ.\nIn September, the popular NFL Zone returned to Roku timed for the kickoff of the 2024-25 season, creating a\nvaluable opportunity for advertisers to activate their brand within the NFL Zone. Viewers can once again find\nwhere to watch live and upcoming NFL games, League highlights, and other great NFL content – all from a single\ndestination. This is particularly useful for fans to discover where to stream their favorite teams across direct-to-\nconsumer, TVE apps, and NFL+, the League’s direct-to-consumer service. Similar to the Olympics, the NFL Zone\nhad prominent placement in our Home Screen Menu for the first time to further highlight the NFL Zone for fans.\n2 Source: Circana, LLC, Retail Tracking Service, US, TV, Software Service, Unit Sales, January 2019 – September 2024 and Q3 2024\n3 Source: Circana, LLC, Retail Tracking Service, TV, Software Service, Unit Sales, 3 Months Ending September 2024\n4 Tom’s Guide\n5 CNET\nRoku Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter 2\nThe Olympics and NFL Kickoff Weekend highlighted in the Roku Home Screen Menu for the first time\nThe Roku Channel\nIn Q3, The Roku Channel was the #3 app on our platform by both reach and engagement for the third straight quarter,\nwith Streaming Hours up 80% YoY. Additionally, The Roku Channel hit an all-time high on Nielsen’s The GaugeTM\nranking for August, representing 4.1% of all TV streaming time in the U.S.6 Our position as the lead-in to TV continues\nto drive significant growth.\nOur audience turns to The Roku Channel for both its vast on-demand and linear options as well as live events, like\nsports and news. We continue to expand our offering, while making it easy for viewers to find the programming they\nare looking for. In August, we launched the Roku Sports Channel, our always-on FAST channel that leads viewers\nthrough the wide variety of free sports content available on The Roku Channel. We also expanded our talk series\nofferings on The Roku Channel with the addition of Good Morning Football: Overtime, a new extension series of NFL\nNetwork’s long-running Good Morning Football.\n6 Nielsen The GaugeTM, August 2024\nRoku Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter 3\nThe Roku Sports Channel leads viewers through free sports content available\non The Roku Channel, including MLB Sunday Leadoff games.\nAs they do with sports, viewers are streaming more news programming as they cut the cord. During the U.S.\npresidential debate on June 27, The Roku Channel’s FAST offering achieved its highest day for both reach and\nengagement. For the U.S. presidential debate on September 10, we made it easy for viewers to find the debate by\nhighlighting it on our Home Screen in the Spotlight Ad and in the Content Row. During the debate, more than half of\nRoku Channel viewers in the U.S. watched on one of the live channels.\nWe offer our audience a broad variety of free sports, news, and entertainment on The Roku Channel. We recently\nexpanded our partnership with Disney to include new FAST channels for Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Nat Geo\nSharks, Wicked Tuna, and ESPN the Ocho (US). We also launched over 70 FAST channels from Paramount, which\nincludes programming for younger audiences like The Jersey Shore Channel and The Challenge Channel.\nThe Roku Channel also provides free original programming from Roku. In addition to providing exclusive content for\nviewers, Roku Originals create opportunities for brands to integrate into original storytelling, connecting with\nconsumers through content that is relevant to the advertiser’s products. This is deeply immersive and valued by TV\nad buyers accustomed to buying ads against specific content. For example, Ally Bank wanted to increase favorability\nand consideration for its services. In partnership with Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine, we worked with Ally to\ncreate Side Hustlers, a series about the unique challenges women face when starting their own businesses. In doing\nso Ally aligned its brand with messages of financial empowerment and well-being. The show drove a significant lift in\nbrand favorability and program viewership increased the likelihood a viewer would open an Ally account7.\n7 Sampled over 600 people ages 25-54 to compare those who viewed Side Hustlers vs. those who didn't\nRoku Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter 4\nAlly partnered with Roku and Hello Sunshine\nto reach women with messages of financial empowerment.\nGrowing Monetization\nWe generate Platform revenue primarily from the sale of advertising (including direct and programmatic video\nadvertising, ads integrated into our UI, sponsorships, and related ad products and services), as well as streaming\nservices distribution (including subscription and transactional revenue, the sale of Premium Subscriptions, and the\nsale of branded app buttons on remote controls).\nIn Q3, we grew Platform revenue to $908 million, with Platform gross margin of 54%, which is up 80 basis points QoQ.\nWhile Platform revenue was up 15% YoY, ARPU of $41.10 (TTM) was relatively flat YoY. This reflects an increasing\nshare of Streaming Households in international markets, where we are currently focused on scale and engagement.\nAdditionally, each country is at a different stage of monetization, and each has different economic characteristics.\nFor example, Mexico is one of our fastest growing countries, and we have significant penetration of broadband\nhouseholds. However, we are in the early stages of monetization, and our ARPU in Mexico is currently a fraction of\nour ARPU in the U.S.\nStreaming Services Distribution\nIn Q3, streaming services distribution activities grew faster than Platform revenue overall, due primarily to price\nincreases for subscription-based services on our platform. We continue to focus on growing the share of subscriptions\nbilled through Roku Pay, our payments and billing service that makes it easy for both our viewers and content partners\nto transact subscriptions. In the NBC Olympic Zone, viewers could use Roku Pay to subscribe to Peacock – an easy\nway to begin watching the games immediately. The NBC Olympic Zone helped to drive Peacock sign-ups, and a\nsignificant portion were first-time subscribers8.\nAdvertising\nIn Q3, the YoY growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform – excluding M&E (media & entertainment) –\noutperformed both the overall ad market and the OTT ad market in the U.S.9 The YoY growth of Political, Retail, and\nConsumer Packaged Goods ad verticals, among others, were up on the Roku platform, while the M&E and Health &\n8 Users that had been exposed to the Zone and then signed-up for a subscription within 3 days of the exposure\n9 3Q24 SMI data; OTT: over-the-top\nRoku Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter 5\nWellness ad verticals were pressured. Due to our many growth initiatives and focused efforts to diversify ad demand,\nM&E is a significantly smaller percentage of our overall Platform business now versus the last several years.\nWe continue to leverage the power of our Home Screen to grow monetization and diversify revenue across ad\nverticals. The NBC Olympic Zone, featured on our Home Screen, was sponsored by leading brands across a diverse\narray of verticals including Retail, Transportation, Telecom, and Auto. In September, we partnered with the Television\nAcademy to present The Emmys Collection, a dedicated destination for Emmy-nominated and winning titles. The\ncollection was sponsored by a large specialty beauty retailer in the U.S. These viewer destinations drive engagement\nwhile broadening the sponsorship portfolio we offer to advertisers. As a result, ad spend on our Home Screen from\nnon-M&E brands has grown in each of the last three quarters.\nThe Emmys Collection, a dedicated destination for nominated and winning titles\nWe continue to drive new sources of ad demand. In Q3, we expanded our ad offering to better serve small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). Roku Ads Manager is our new, self-service CTV advertising solution, providing\nperformance features like advanced targeting, conversion optimization and measurement, and even shoppable\nad formats. This solution builds upon our growing list of ad offerings that provide advertisers more choices for how\nthey buy Roku Media – whether it be through direct IO (insertion order), a preferred DSP (demand-side platform)\npartner, or now through self service. This allows us to serve a diverse array of advertisers, across verticals and\nbusiness-sizes, from SMBs to enterprise companies.\nWe also continue to deepen our relationships with third-party platforms to better serve advertisers’ programmatic\nneeds. We have partnered with The Trade Desk (TTD) so that TTD customers can leverage Roku Media and audience\ndata programmatically, and we have integrated Unified ID 2.0, TTD’s identity solution. This represents our deepest\nintegration to date with a third-party DSP, and we are beginning to see positive impacts. We’ll continue to do more\nintegrations that expand our ability to serve the entire demand curve at multiple price points and in doing so, we\nexpect to drive incremental revenue over time.\nRoku Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter 6\nKey Performance Metric Update\nSince our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly\nmore TV time streaming than watching cable10. Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily\nfocused on growing Platform revenue and profitability. As a result, we will be updating our Key Performance Metrics\n(KPMs) to better align with these priorities.\nBeginning with our Q1 2025 earnings results, we will no longer report quarterly updates on Streaming Households\nand, by extension, ARPU. Our KPMs will be Streaming Hours, Platform revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow,\nand we remain committed to growing all these metrics over time.\nAs noted earlier in this Letter, our various markets are in different stages of monetization and have different\neconomics. While a large portion of our Streaming Household growth is in our international markets, the majority of\nour Platform revenue is currently generated in the U.S. Therefore, as we continue to grow internationally, Streaming\nHousehold growth is not representative of Platform revenue growth.\nWe expect to continue to grow Streaming Households in all our locations, including the U.S. We will provide updates\non our scale as we achieve certain milestones, such as 100 million Streaming Households, which we expect to reach\nin the next 12-18 months.\nOutlook\nWe are pleased with the execution of our monetization initiatives. We expect these initiatives, including the early\npositive impacts from our deeper integration with The Trade Desk, along with tailwinds from Political ad spend to\ncontinue in Q4. We estimate Q4 Total net revenue of $1.140 billion growing 16% YoY, with Platform revenue growing\n14% YoY and Devices revenue growing 25% YoY. We estimate Q4 Total gross profit of $465 million and Adjusted\nEBITDA of $30 million. We expect Sales and Marketing to be more seasonal this year than in the prior year. As a result,\nwe expect OpEx to be up 9% YoY in Q4. However, Sales and Marketing and total OpEx will be slightly down for the\nfull year 2024, reflecting our ongoing operational discipline. Our expectations for both Q4 and 2024 OpEx YoY growth\nrates exclude one-time restructuring charges from 2023.\nWe remain confident in our ability to grow Platform revenue in 2025 and beyond as we grow ad demand, lean into\nour Home Screen as the lead-in for TV, and grow Roku-billed subscriptions.\nThank you for your support, and Happy Streaming™!\nAnthony Wood, Founder and CEO, and Dan Jedda, CFO\nConference Call Webcast – Oct. 30, 2024, at 2 p.m. PT\nThe Company will host a webcast of its conference call to discuss the Q3 2024 results at 2 p.m. Pacific Time / 5 p.m.\nEastern Time on Oct. 30, 2024.

These non-GAAP\nmeasures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow (FCF). In order for our investors to be better able to compare\nour current results with those of previous periods, we have included a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in the tables at the end of this letter. The Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation excludes other income (expense),\nnet, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, and income tax\n(benefit)/expense from net income (loss), and the FCF reconciliation excludes purchases of property and equipment\nand effects of exchange rates on cash from the cash flows from operating activities, in each case where applicable.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful as a supplement in evaluating our ongoing operational\nperformance and enhancing an overall understanding of our past financial performance. However, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures have limitations, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP financial\ninformation, such as GAAP net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities. In addition, these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences in\nmethods of calculation.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis shareholder letter contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.\nStatements contained herein that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and can be\nidentified by terms such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “may,” \"plan,” “seek,”\n“should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.
