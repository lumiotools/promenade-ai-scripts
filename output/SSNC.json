Reconciliation of Revenues to Adjusted Revenues\nAdjusted revenues represents revenues adjusted to include a) amounts that would have been recognized if deferred revenue were not\nadjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition and b) amounts that would have been recognized if not for adjustments to deferred\nrevenue and retained earnings related to the adoption of ASC 606. Adjusted revenues is presented because we use this measure to\nevaluate performance of our business against prior periods and believe it is a useful indicator of the underlying performance of our\nbusiness. Adjusted revenues is not a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted revenues\ndoes not represent revenues, as that term is defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues as an\nindicator of our operating performance. Adjusted revenues as presented herein is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures presented by other companies. Below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to revenues, the GAAP measure we believe to\nbe most directly comparable to adjusted revenues.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 1,465.8 $ 1,365.9 $ 4,352.3 $ 4,091.2\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7) (0.8) (2.2) (2.5)\nPurchase accounting adjustments impact on revenue 1.7 1.6 4.9 4.8\nAdjusted revenues $ 1,466.8 $ 1,366.7 $ 4,355.0 $ 4,093.5\nThe following is a breakdown of software-enabled services and license, maintenance and related revenues and adjusted software-\nenabled services and license, maintenance and related revenues.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSoftware-enabled services $ 1,206.2 $ 1,122.1 $ 3,586.3 $ 3,342.8\nLicense, maintenance and related 259.6 243.8 766.0 748.4\nTotal revenues $ 1,465.8 $ 1,365.9 $ 4,352.3 $ 4,091.2\nSoftware-enabled services $ 1,207.3 $ 1,123.1 $ 3,589.1 $ 3,345.4\nLicense, maintenance and related 259.5 243.6 765.9 748.1\nTotal adjusted revenues $ 1,466.8 $ 1,366.7 $ 4,355.0 $ 4,093.5\nNote 2. Reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation,\npurchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue and related costs, ASC 606 adoption impact and other expenses. Adjusted\noperating income is presented because we use this measure to evaluate performance of our business and believe it is a useful indicator\nof our underlying performance. Adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under GAAP. Adjusted operating income does\nnot represent operating income, as that term is defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating\nincome as an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted operating income as presented herein is not necessarily comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures by other companies. The following is a reconciliation between adjusted operating income and operating\nincome, the GAAP measure we believe to be most directly comparable to adjusted operating income.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income $ 325.1 $ 306.4 $ 985.6 $ 874.7\nAmortization of intangible assets 152.4 150.6 449.1 445.3\nStock-based compensation 52.2 42.1 147.9 117.5\nPurchase accounting adjustments (1) 3.4 3.6 9.5 12.0\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7) (0.8) (2.0) (2.3)\nAcquisition related (2) 1.6 2.4 2.7 7.8\nFacilities and workforce restructuring 14.0 13.8 33.6 42.5\nOther (3) 1.7 0.2 7.2 0.8\nAdjusted operating income $ 549.7 $ 518.3 $ 1,633.6 $ 1,498.3\nAdjusted operating income attributable to noncontrolling interest (4) (0.9) (0.9) (3.1) (2.1)\nAdjusted operating income attributable to SS&C common\nstockholders $ 548.8 $ 517.4 $ 1,630.5 $ 1,496.2\n(1) Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized\nif deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and\ncommissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were\nnot adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to decrease depreciation expense by the amount that\nwould not have been recognized if property, plant and equipment were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition.\n(2) Acquisition related includes costs related to both current acquisitions and the resolution of pre-acquisition matters for prior period\nacquisitions.\n(3) Other includes additional expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Credit Agreement from\nConsolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance.\n(4) In 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx, LLC in which we are the majority interest holder and primary\nbeneficiary. As such, we consolidate DomaniRx, LLC as a variable interest entity. Adjusted operating income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interest represents adjusted operating income based on the ownership interest retained by the respective\nnoncontrolling parties.\nNote 3. Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Consolidated EBITDA, defined\nunder our Credit Agreement entered into in April 2018, as amended, is used in calculating covenant compliance, and is EBITDA\nadjusted for certain items. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting from or adding to EBITDA items of income or expense\ndescribed below. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting acquired EBITDA (as defined below) from\nConsolidated EBITDA. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are presented because we use these\nmeasures to evaluate performance of our business and believe them to be useful indicators of an entity’s debt capacity and its ability to\nservice debt. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and\nshould not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as\nindicators of our operating performance. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures by other\ncompanies. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA to net income.\nTwelve\nMonths\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024\nNet income $ 164.6 $ 156.6 $ 513.3 $ 413.7 $ 708.3\nInterest expense, net 109.6 120.6 338.9 350.5 458.3\nProvision for income taxes 60.0 51.2 140.5 167.3 222.2\nDepreciation and amortization 171.3 168.5 504.3 500.4 674.4\nEBITDA 505.5 496.9 1,497.0 1,431.9 2,063.2\nStock-based compensation 52.2 42.1 147.9 117.5 189.8\nAcquired EBITDA and cost savings (1) 0.8 — 19.4 — 34.5\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 1.3 0.5 30.1 1.1 31.1\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net (1.1) (27.5) (20.7) (42.6) (78.2)\nPurchase accounting adjustments (2) 1.9 2.4 5.7 6.7 8.3\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7) (0.8) (2.0) (2.3) (2.7)\nForeign currency translation (gains) losses (4.2) 2.5 1.6 3.7 (2.3)\nInvestment (gains) losses (3) (5.3) 0.5 (17.3) (13.7) (22.5)\nFacilities and workforce restructuring 13.9 13.8 33.6 42.5 47.9\nAcquisition related (4) 1.8 3.9 2.7 (1.3) 3.9\nOther (5) 1.8 0.5 6.4 3.8 10.0\nConsolidated EBITDA $ 567.9 $ 534.8 $ 1,704.4 $ 1,547.3 $ 2,283.0\nAcquired EBITDA and cost savings (1) (0.8) — (19.4) — (34.5)\nAdjusted Consolidated EBITDA $ 567.1 $ 534.8 $ 1,685.0 $ 1,547.3 $ 2,248.5\nAdjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling\ninterest (6) (0.9) (0.9) (3.1) (2.1) (4.0)\nAdjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable to SS&C common\nstockholders $ 566.2 $ 533.9 $ 1,681.9 $ 1,545.2 $ 2,244.5\n(1) Acquired EBITDA reflects the EBITDA impact of significant businesses that were acquired during the period as if the acquisition\noccurred at the beginning of the period, as well as cost savings enacted in connection with acquisitions.\n(2) Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized\nif deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and\ncommissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were\nnot adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to increase or decrease rent expense by the amount\nthat would have been recognized if lease obligations were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisitions.\n(3) Investment gains includes unrealized fair value adjustments of investments and dividend income received on investments.\n(4) Acquisition related includes costs related to both current acquisitions and the resolution of pre-acquisition matters for prior period\nacquisitions.\n(5) Other includes additional expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Credit Agreement from\nConsolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance.\n(6) In 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx, LLC in which we are the majority interest holder and primary\nbeneficiary. As such, we consolidate DomaniRx, LLC as a variable interest entity. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable\nto noncontrolling interest represents adjusted Consolidated EBITDA based on the ownership interest retained by the respective\nnoncontrolling parties.\nNote 4. Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to SS&C to\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to SS&C\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C represent net income and earnings per share\nattributable to SS&C before amortization of intangible assets and deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, purchase\naccounting adjustments and other items. We consider adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to\nSS&C to be important to management and investors because they represent our operational performance exclusive of the effects of\namortization of intangible assets and deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, purchase accounting adjustments, loss on\nextinguishment of debt and other items, that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors. Adjusted net\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not recognized terms under GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted\nearnings per share do not represent net income or diluted earnings per share, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not\nbe considered as alternatives to net income or diluted earnings per share as indicators of our operating performance. Adjusted net\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C as presented herein are not necessarily comparable to similarly\ntitled measures presented by other companies. Below is a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per\nshare attributable to SS&C to net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C, the GAAP measures we believe to be\nmost directly comparable to adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nGAAP – Net income $ 164.6 $ 156.6 $ 513.3 $ 413.7\nAmortization of intangible assets 152.4 150.6 449.1 445.3\nAmortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount 1.4 3.3 6.7 10.2\nStock-based compensation 52.2 42.1 147.9 117.5\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 1.3 0.5 30.1 1.1\nPurchase accounting adjustments (1) 3.4 3.6 9.5 12.0\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7) (0.8) (2.0) (2.3)\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net (1.1) (27.5) (20.7) (42.6)\nForeign currency translation (gains) losses (4.2) 2.5 1.6 3.7\nInvestment (gains) losses (2) (3.1) 2.7 (2.5) 0.9\nFacilities and workforce restructuring 13.9 13.8 33.6 42.5\nAcquisition related (3) 1.8 3.9 2.7 (1.3)\nOther (4) 1.8 0.8 6.3 4.7\nIncome tax effect (5) (55.4) (53.6) (201.7) (137.6)\nAdjusted net income $ 328.3 $ 298.5 $ 973.9 $ 867.8\nAdjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (6) (1.2) (1.2) (3.6) (2.3)\nAdjusted net income attributable to SS&C common stockholders $ 327.1 $ 297.3 $ 970.3 $ 865.5\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C common\nstockholders $ 1.29 $ 1.17 $ 3.83 $ 3.39\nGAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C common\nstockholders $ 0.65 $ 0.61 $ 2.02 $ 1.62\nDiluted weighted-average shares outstanding 254.1 253.9 253.3 255.3\n(1) Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized\nif deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and\ncommissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were\nnot adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to decrease depreciation expense by the amount that\nwould not have been recognized if property, plant and equipment were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition.\n(2) Investment gains includes unrealized fair value adjustments of investments. In prior periods, investment gains also included\ndividend income received on investments.

Reconciliation of Revenues to Adjusted Revenues\nAdjusted revenues represents revenues adjusted to include a) amounts that would have been recognized if deferred revenue were not\nadjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition and b) amounts that would have been recognized if not for adjustments to deferred\nrevenue and retained earnings related to the adoption of ASC 606. Adjusted revenues is presented because we use this measure to\nevaluate performance of our business against prior periods and believe it is a useful indicator of the underlying performance of our\nbusiness. Adjusted revenues is not a recognized term under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Adjusted revenues\ndoes not represent revenues, as that term is defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues as an\nindicator of our operating performance. Adjusted revenues as presented herein is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures presented by other companies. Below is a reconciliation of adjusted revenues to revenues, the GAAP measure we believe to\nbe most directly comparable to adjusted revenues.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenues $ 1,465.8 $ 1,365.9 $ 4,352.3 $ 4,091.2\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7 ) (0.8 ) (2.2 ) (2.5 )\nPurchase accounting adjustments impact on revenue 1.7 1.6 4.9 4.8\nAdjusted revenues $ 1,466.8 $ 1,366.7 $ 4,355.0 $ 4,093.5\nThe following is a breakdown of software-enabled services and license, maintenance and related revenues and adjusted software-\nenabled services and license, maintenance and related revenues.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSoftware-enabled services $ 1,206.2 $ 1,122.1 $ 3,586.3 $ 3,342.8\nLicense, maintenance and related 259.6 243.8 766.0 748.4\nTotal revenues $ 1,465.8 $ 1,365.9 $ 4,352.3 $ 4,091.2\nSoftware-enabled services $ 1,207.3 $ 1,123.1 $ 3,589.1 $ 3,345.4\nLicense, maintenance and related 259.5 243.6 765.9 748.1\nTotal adjusted revenues $ 1,466.8 $ 1,366.7 $ 4,355.0 $ 4,093.5\nNote 2. Reconciliation of Operating Income to Adjusted Operating Income\nAdjusted operating income represents operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation,\npurchase accounting adjustments for deferred revenue and related costs, ASC 606 adoption impact and other expenses. Adjusted\noperating income is presented because we use this measure to evaluate performance of our business and believe it is a useful indicator\nof our underlying performance. Adjusted operating income is not a recognized term under GAAP. Adjusted operating income does\nnot represent operating income, as that term is defined under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating\nincome as an indicator of our operating performance. Adjusted operating income as presented herein is not necessarily comparable to\nsimilarly titled measures by other companies. The following is a reconciliation between adjusted operating income and operating\nincome, the GAAP measure we believe to be most directly comparable to adjusted operating income.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating income $ 325.1 $ 306.4 $ 985.6 $ 874.7\nAmortization of intangible assets 152.4 150.6 449.1 445.3\nStock-based compensation 52.2 42.1 147.9 117.5\nPurchase accounting adjustments (1) 3.4 3.6 9.5 12.0\nASC 606 adoption impact (0.7 ) (0.8 ) (2.0 ) (2.3 )\nAcquisition related (2) 1.6 2.4 2.7 7.8\nFacilities and workforce restructuring 14.0 13.8 33.6 42.5\nOther (3) 1.7 0.2 7.2 0.8\nAdjusted operating income $ 549.7 $ 518.3 $ 1,633.6 $ 1,498.3\nAdjusted operating income attributable to noncontrolling interest (4) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (3.1 ) (2.1 )\nAdjusted operating income attributable to SS&C common\nstockholders $ 548.8 $ 517.4 $ 1,630.5 $ 1,496.2\n(1) Purchase accounting adjustments include (a) an adjustment to increase revenues by the amount that would have been recognized\nif deferred revenue were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition, (b) an adjustment to increase personnel and\ncommissions expense by the amount that would have been recognized if prepaid commissions and deferred personnel costs were\nnot adjusted to fair value at the date of the acquisitions and (c) an adjustment to decrease depreciation expense by the amount that\nwould not have been recognized if property, plant and equipment were not adjusted to fair value at the date of acquisition.\n(2) Acquisition related includes costs related to both current acquisitions and the resolution of pre-acquisition matters for prior period\nacquisitions.\n(3) Other includes additional expenses and income that are permitted to be excluded per the terms of our Credit Agreement from\nConsolidated EBITDA, a financial measure used in calculating our covenant compliance.\n(4) In 2021, we entered into a joint venture named DomaniRx, LLC in which we are the majority interest holder and primary\nbeneficiary. As such, we consolidate DomaniRx, LLC as a variable interest entity. Adjusted operating income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interest represents adjusted operating income based on the ownership interest retained by the respective\nnoncontrolling parties.\nNote 3. Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Consolidated EBITDA, defined\nunder our Credit Agreement entered into in April 2018, as amended, is used in calculating covenant compliance, and is EBITDA\nadjusted for certain items. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting from or adding to EBITDA items of income or expense\ndescribed below. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting acquired EBITDA (as defined below) from\nConsolidated EBITDA. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are presented because we use these\nmeasures to evaluate performance of our business and believe them to be useful indicators of an entity’s debt capacity and its ability to\nservice debt. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and\nshould not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as\nindicators of our operating performance. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures by other\ncompanies.

As such, we consolidate DomaniRx, LLC as a variable interest entity. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA attributable\nto noncontrolling interest represents adjusted Consolidated EBITDA based on the ownership interest retained by the respective\nnoncontrolling parties.\nNote 4. Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to SS&C to\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to SS&C\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C represent net income and earnings per share\nattributable to SS&C before amortization of intangible assets and deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, purchase\naccounting adjustments and other items. We consider adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to\nSS&C to be important to management and investors because they represent our operational performance exclusive of the effects of\namortization of intangible assets and deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, purchase accounting adjustments, loss on\nextinguishment of debt and other items, that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors. Adjusted net\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not recognized terms under GAAP. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted\nearnings per share do not represent net income or diluted earnings per share, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not\nbe considered as alternatives to net income or diluted earnings per share as indicators of our operating performance. Adjusted net\nincome and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C as presented herein are not necessarily comparable to similarly\ntitled measures presented by other companies.

Consolidated EBITDA, definedunder our Credit Agreement entered into in April 2018,\nas amended, is used in calculating covenant compliance, and is EBITDA adjusted for certain items. Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting from or adding to EBITDA items of income\nor expense described below. Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA is calculated by subtracting acquired EBITDA (as defined below) from Consolidated EBITDA. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and\nAdjusted Consolidated EBITDA are presented because we use these measures to evaluate performance of our business and believe them to be useful indicators of an entity’s debt capacity\nand its ability to service debt. EBITDA, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA are not recognized terms underGAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as\nalternatives to operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance.

We consider adjusted net income and adjusted\ndiluted earnings per share attributable to SS&C to be important to management and investors because they represent our operational performance exclusive of the effects of\namortization of intangible assets and deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation, purchase accounting adjustments, loss on extinguishment of debt and other items,\nthat are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not recognized terms under\nGAAP.
