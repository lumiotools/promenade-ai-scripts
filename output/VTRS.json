(Nasdaq: VTRS) today announced robust financial results for the third quarter of 2024, driven by positive momentum against all three pillars of its strategy. The Company continued to demonstrate its ability to grow its base business, delivering total revenues of $3.8 billion including new product revenues of $133 million; it added to its financial strength with the repayment of approximately $1.9 billion of debt; and it expanded its innovative portfolio by entering into an exclusive licensing agreement with Lexicon Pharmaceuticals for sotagliflozin outside of the U.S. and Europe.\n\n\"I am very pleased to report strong third quarter results that continue the momentum we've seen all year,\" said [Scott A.

Our company is operating from a position of financial strength with a clear and focused outlook that centers on capital allocation. Returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases will remain a central element of optimizing and maximizing shareholder value. We will balance this with making disciplined investments in commercialized or late-stage assets through regional and global business development to drive our future growth.\"\n\n\"We continue to make excellent progress executing on our debt paydown commitment and are on pace to achieve our long-term gross leverage target of ~3.0x by year end,\" said [Doretta Mistras](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=2971884709&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.viatris.com%2Fen%2Fabout-us%2Fexecutive-leadership-team%2Fdoretta-mistras&a=Doretta+Mistras), chief financial officer, Viatris. \"With sector-leading cash flow and a strong balance sheet as our foundation, I believe we are well-positioned to deliver consistent base business growth, while simultaneously investing in our business and returning significant capital to our shareholders.\"\n\n[1] For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total revenues declined ~(5)% on a U.S. GAAP basis.\n\n[2] For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, U.S. GAAP net earnings declined from $332 million to $95 million, or ~(71)%, and U.S. GAAP diluted EPS declined from $0.27 per share to $0.08 per share, or ~(70)%.\n\n[3] Debt repayment of ~$1.9 billion includes the impact of the make-whole call of €292M (~$325M) of remaining 2025 Euro Senior Notes on October 16, 2024. The Company has not quantified future amounts to develop its long-term gross leverage target, which does not reflect company guidance, but has stated its goal to manage notional gross debt and adjusted EBITDA over time in order to generally maintain or reach the target.

This was partially offset by unfavorable channel dynamics in North America and the impact of government price regulations in Japan and Australia. \n  * Generics net sales reflect strong growth from new product performance in Developed Markets, continued growth from complex products, and solid performance across our broader European portfolio. \n  * The Company generated approximately $133 million in new product revenues in the quarter primarily driven by Breyna™, lisdexamfetamine, and other new products globally. The Company expects to deliver approximately $500 million to $600 million in new product revenues in 2024. \n  * U.S. GAAP net earnings were $95 million and adjusted EBITDA was $1.3 billion, up ~4% on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis. U.S. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.08 per share and adjusted EPS was $0.75 per share, up ~6% on a divestiture-adjusted operational basis. \n  * This quarter's results demonstrate the Company's financial strength, as the Company generated U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities of $827 million, and free cash flow, excluding the impact of transaction costs primarily related to the divestitures, of $866 million.\n\n\n\n**Additional Updates**\n\n  * The Company retired all of its 2025 and more than a quarter of its 2026 debt maturities, totaling approximately $1.9 billion in debt, which includes the make-whole call of its 2025 notes that settled in October. \n  * In August, the Company [presented a late-breaking oral presentation at the Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology Annual Congress](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=1184154890&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.viatris.com%2F2024-08-23-Viatris-Presents-Late-Breaking-Abstract-on-Cenerimod-at-the-26th-Asia-Pacific-League-of-Associations-for-Rheumatology-Annual-Congress&a=presented+a+late-breaking+oral+presentation+at+the+Asia-Pacific+League+of+Associations+for+Rheumatology+Annual+Congress) of one of its Phase 2 studies of cenerimod in Japanese patients. Data showed a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity consistent with results from other global Phase 2 studies of cenerimod. The study also showed that cenerimod for the treatment of moderate to severe systemic lupus erythematosus can be considered safe and well tolerated. \n  * In October, the Company [announced positive top-line results of its Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of EFFEXOR® (venlafaxine) in Japanese adults](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=1992777239&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.viatris.com%2F2024-10-09-Viatris-Announces-Positive-Top-line-Results-from-Phase-3-Study-of-EFFEXOR-R-in-Japanese-Adults-with-Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder-GAD&a=announced+positive+top-line+results+of+its+Phase+3+study+evaluating+the+safety+and+efficacy+of+EFFEXOR%C2%AE+\\(venlafaxine\\)+in+Japanese+adults) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Treatment with once-daily EFFEXOR® met primary and all secondary efficacy endpoints, and it was generally well tolerated with a profile consistent with its known safety profile in non-Japanese patients. There are currently no approved treatments available for GAD in Japan. The Company is targeting its submission to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in 2025. \n  * In October, the Company [announced it entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Lexicon Pharmaceuticals for sotagliflozin](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=2741934415&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.viatris.com%2F2024-10-16-Viatris-Announces-Exclusive-Licensing-Agreement-with-Lexicon-Pharmaceuticals-for-Sotagliflozin-in-all-Markets-Outside-of-the-U-S-and-Europe&a=announced+it+entered+an+exclusive+licensing+agreement+with+Lexicon+Pharmaceuticals+for+sotagliflozin) in all markets outside of the U.S. and Europe. This licensing agreement leverages Viatris' expertise in cardiovascular diseases and its Global Healthcare Gateway® — which offers partners ready access to the Company's unique global infrastructure. Sotagliflozin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May 2023 to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit in adults with heart failure or type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular risk factors. \n  * In October, the Company was named to [Forbes' list of World's Best Employers 2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=2078547884&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.viatris.com%2F2024-10-08-Viatris-Named-to-Forbes-Annual-List-of-the-Worlds-Best-Employers-for-the-Fourth-Year-in-a-Row&a=Forbes%27+list+of+World%27s+Best+Employers+2024). This is the fourth year in a row that Viatris has received this recognition. The World's Best Employers for 2024 were selected through an independent survey encompassing a vast sample of more than 300,000 participants across 50 different countries. \n  * In October, the Company was named to [Forbes' list of World's Top Companies for Women 2024](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4296461-1&h=2169956642&u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.viatris.com%2F2024-10-29-Viatris-Named-to-Forbes-Worlds-Top-Companies-for-Women-2024-List&a=Forbes%27+list+of+World%27s+Top+Companies+for+Women+2024). The World's Top Companies for Women 2024 were chosen among multi-national corporations that were evaluated in multiple globally administered independent surveys of approximately 100,000 women in 37 countries. \n  * In October, in recognition of ongoing and systematic work to further advance sustainable operations and responsible practices, as well as sustainability disclosures, the Company was upgraded in the annual MSCI ESG Rating and the ISS ESG Corporate Rating. For the latter, the Company further strengthened its Prime rating.\n\n\n\n**Financial Guidance**\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's 2024 financial guidance as of November 7, 2024. The Company is not providing forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS) or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because it is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items, including integration, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements, and other contingencies, such as changes to contingent consideration, acquired IPR&D and certain other gains or losses, including for the fair value accounting for non-marketable equity investments, as well as related income tax accounting, because certain of these items have not occurred, are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. With respect to the Estimated Ranges provided as of August 8, 2024, and November 7, 2024, U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for 2024 is estimated to be between $2.62 billion and $2.92 billion, with a midpoint of approximately $2.77 billion. With respect to the Estimated Ranges provided as of August 8, 2024, Viatris did not provide forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net earnings or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance. Please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information. The Company currently expects to be at the midpoint of the November 7, 2024, guidance ranges.\n\n**_(In millions, except Adjusted EPS)_** |  **Estimated Ranges(2)** **August 8, 2024** |  **Midpoint(2)** **August 8, 2024** |  **Acquired IPR &D(3)** |  **Estimated Ranges(4)** **November 7, 2024** |  **Midpoint (4)** **November 7, 2024**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nTotal Revenues |  $14,600 - $15,100 |  $14,850 |  $14,600 - $15,100 |  $14,850  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $4,600 - $4,870 |  $4,735 |  ($25) |  $4,575 - $4,845 |  $4,710  \nFree Cash Flow (1) |  $2,170 - $2,570 |  $2,370 |  $2,170 - $2,570 |  $2,370  \nAdjusted EPS (1) |  $2.58 - $2.73 |  $2.66 |  ($0.02) |  $2.56 - $2.71 |  $2.64  \n  \n(1)  |  Non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross margins, adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow excluding the impact of transaction costs primarily related to the divestitures, adjusted R&D and as a % of total revenues, adjusted SG&A and as a % of total revenues, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted interest expense, adjusted other income, net, adjusted effective tax rate, constant currency total revenues, constant currency net sales, constant currency adjusted EBITDA, constant currency adjusted EPS, and divestiture-adjusted operational change, are presented in order to supplement investors' and other readers' understanding and assessment of the financial performance of Viatris Inc. (\"Viatris\" or the \"Company\"). Free cash flow refers to U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Management uses these measures internally for forecasting, budgeting, measuring its operating performance, and incentive-based awards. Primarily due to acquisitions, divestitures and other significant events which may impact comparability of our periodic operating results, Viatris believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations (and comparisons of its current operations with historical and future operations) would be difficult if the disclosure of its financial results was limited to financial measures prepared only in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures are useful supplemental information for our investors and when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations. The financial performance of the Company is measured by senior management, in part, using adjusted metrics included herein, along with other performance metrics. In addition, the Company believes that including EBITDA and supplemental adjustments applied in presenting adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate the Company's ability to comply with financial debt covenants and assess the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness. The Company also believes that adjusted EBITDA better focuses management on the Company's underlying operational results and true business performance and is used, in part, for management's incentive compensation. We also report sales performance using the non-GAAP financial measures of \"constant currency\", also referred to herein as \"operational change\", total revenues, net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. These measures provide information on the change in total revenues, net sales, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS assuming that foreign currency exchange rates had not changed between the prior and current period. The comparisons presented at constant currency rates reflect comparative local currency sales at the prior year's foreign exchange rates. We routinely evaluate our net sales, total revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating a period-to-period comparison of our operational activities, and believe that this presentation also provides useful information to investors for the same reason. Divestiture-adjusted operational change refers to operational change, further adjusted for the impact of divestitures that have closed during 2023 and 2024 by excluding proportionate net sales from those divested businesses from comparable prior periods. The \"Summary of Total Revenues by Segment\" table below compares net sales on an actual and constant currency basis for each reportable segment for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as well as for total revenues, as well as divestiture adjusted operational change in net sales and total revenues. Also, set forth below, Viatris has provided reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Investors and other readers are encouraged to review the related U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures set forth below, and investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For additional information regarding the components and uses of Non-GAAP financial measures refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Viatris' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nWith respect to the Estimated Ranges as provided as of August 8, 2024, at that time the Company did not provide forward-looking guidance for U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS or a quantitative reconciliation of its 2024 adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, U.S. GAAP net earnings (loss) or U.S. GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because it was unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items, including integration, acquisition and divestiture-related expenses, restructuring expenses, asset impairments, litigation settlements and other contingencies, such as changes to contingent consideration, acquired IPR&D and certain other gains or losses, including for the fair value accounting for non-marketable equity investments, as well as related income tax accounting, because certain of these items had not occurred, were out of the Company's control and/or could be reasonably predicted without unreasonable effort. These items were uncertain, depended on various factors, and could have had a material impact on U.S. GAAP reported results for the guidance period. As previously disclosed, such guidance ranges excluded any divestiture-related taxes and transaction costs as well as any unknown acquired IPR&D to be incurred in any future period as it could not be reasonably forecasted.\n\n**Certain Key Terms and Presentation Matters**\n\n_New product sales, new product launches or new product revenues:_ Refers to revenue from new products launched in 2024 and the carryover impact of new products, including business development, launched within the last 12 months.\n\n_Operational change:_ Refers to constant currency percentage changes and is derived by translating amounts for the current period at prior year comparative period exchange rates, and in doing so shows the percentage change from 2024 constant currency net sales, revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS to the corresponding amount in the prior year.\n\n_Divestiture-adjusted operational change:_ Refers to operational changes, further adjusted for the impact of the proportionate results from the divestitures that closed in 2023 and 2024, from the 2023 period by excluding such net sales from those divested businesses from comparable prior periods. Also, for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, refers to operational changes, adjusted as outlined in the previous sentence and further adjusted for the mark up for the TSA services provided to Biocon Biologics from the 2023 period.\n\n_SG &A and R&D TSA reimbursement and DSA reimbursement:_ Expenses related to TSA services provided for divested businesses are recorded in their respective functional line item; however, reimbursement of those expenses plus any mark-up is included in other income, net. For comparability purposes, amounts related to the cost reimbursement were reclassified to adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D during 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, primarily related to the Biocon Biologics Transaction. This reclassification had no impact on adjusted net earnings, adjusted EBITDA or adjusted EPS. Any TSA reimbursement and DSA reimbursement amounts related to the closed divestitures are not direct offsets to operational expense and have not been reclassified.\n\n_Closed divestitures_ or _divestitures closed in 2023 and 2024_ : Refers to the divestiture of the Company's rights to two women's healthcare products in certain countries that closed in December 2023 and August 2024, the divestitures of the commercialization rights in certain of the Upjohn Distributor markets that closed in 2023 and 2024, the divestiture of the women's healthcare business that closed in March 2024, the divestiture of the API business in India that closed in June 2024, and the divestiture of the OTC business that closed in July 2024.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\".
