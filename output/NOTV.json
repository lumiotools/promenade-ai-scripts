(Nasdaq: NOTV) (the “Company”),** a leading contract research organization specializing in nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services and research models and related products and services, today announced financial results for the three months (“Q3 FY 2024”) and nine months (\"YTD FY 2024\") ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Revenue by Segment (in millions of USD)**\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **%****change**| **Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024**| **%****change**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024**|  **2023**|  **2024**|  **2023**  \n** _(unaudited)_**| **_(unaudited)_**| **_(unaudited)_**| **_(unaudited)_**  \n**DSA (Discovery & Safety Assessment)**| $| 44.2| $| 46.8| (5.6| )%| $| 135.5| $| 134.9| 0.4| %  \n**RMS (Research Models & Services)**| $| 61.6| $| 110.7| (44.4| )%| $| 224.8| $| 296.8| (24.3| )%  \n**Total**|  $| 105.8| $| 157.5| (32.8| )%| $| 360.3| $| 431.7| (16.5| )%  \n  \n**Management Commentary**\n\nRobert Leasure Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The third quarter was productive for Inotiv; however, the period was not without challenges. Our financial results in Q3 were negatively impacted again, much like Q2, due to lower NHP demand and pricing. However, we were able to accomplish some significant milestones and see signs of improvements going into the end of 2024 and into 2025. We were pleased to see the conclusion of certain open government investigations. We are seeing signs of recovery for the NHP business, we are beginning to see growth in segments of our U.S, European and U.K., RMS businesses and portions of our DSA business. We have completed additional site optimization, integration and transportation initiatives which continue to provide efficiencies and expense reductions while improving service and delivery.\n\nWe have faced some unexpected challenges over the past two years, but we have made progress and have confidence in the future for our industry, our company, and the investments we have made to prepare ourselves for the future. We want to position ourselves so we will not be dependent solely on a market recovery to improve our results of operations and cash flow. Our results for Q3 show some trends towards that momentum.\"\n\n**Financial Highlights**\n\n**Q3 FY 2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $105.8 million in Q3 FY 2024 as compared to $157.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 (“Q3 FY 2023”), driven primarily by a decrease of $49.1 million, or 44.4%, in Research Models and Services (“RMS”) revenue and a $2.5 million, or 5.4%, decrease in Discovery and Safety Assessment (\"DSA\") revenue.\n  * Consolidated net loss for Q3 FY 2024 was $26.1 million, or 24.7% of total revenue, compared to consolidated net income of $0.4 million, or 0.2% of total revenue, in Q3 FY 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in Q3 FY 2024 was $0.1 million, or 0.1% of total revenue, compared to $30.5 million, or 19.4% of total revenue, in Q3 FY 2023.\n  * Book-to-bill ratio for Q3 FY 2024 was 0.94x for the DSA services business.\n  * DSA backlog was $139.4 million at June 30, 2024, down from $149.1 million at June 30, 2023, and down from $142.1 million at March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n**YTD FY 2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Revenue was $360.3 million during YTD FY 2024 compared to $431.7 million during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 (\"YTD FY 2023\"), primarily driven by a $72.0 million, or 24.3%, decrease in RMS revenue.\n  * Consolidated net loss for YTD FY 2024 was $90.0 million, or 25.0% of total revenue, compared to consolidated net loss of $96.2 million, or 22.3% of total revenue, for YTD FY 2023. Consolidated net loss for YTD FY 2024 included a $28.5 million charge related to the Resolution Agreement (the “Resolution Agreement”) the Company and its related entities entered into with the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia (“USAO-WDV”) and the Plea Agreement (the “Plea Agreement”) Envigo RMS, LLC and Envigo Global Services, Inc. entered into with the DOJ and the USAO-WDV. Each of the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement were entered into on June 3, 2024 in connection with the resolution of a previously-announced criminal investigation into the Company’s shuttered canine breeding facility located in Cumberland, Virginia. Consolidated net loss for YTD FY 2023 included a $66.4 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the RMS segment.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA1 in YTD FY 2024 was $12.8 million, or 3.6% of total revenue, compared to $42.1 million, or 9.8% of total revenue, in YTD FY 2023.\n  * Book-to-bill ratio for YTD FY 2024 was 1.06x for the DSA services business.\n\n\n\n1 This is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to “Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation” in this release for further information. \n\n**DSA and RMS Highlights**\n\n  * On June 2, 2024, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company and the lenders party thereto entered into a Fifth Amendment (“Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Fifth Amendment, among other changes, permits charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement to be added back to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA in an amount up to $28.5 million, of which the Company paid $6.5 million during Q3 FY 2024; excludes any direct effects to the Company resulting from the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement from being deemed a material adverse effect under the Credit Agreement; permits liens on the Company and certain subsidiaries in favor of the DOJ in connection with the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement; provides that certain uncured or unwaived breaches of the terms and conditions of the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement shall be considered an event of default under the Credit Agreement; and enables the lenders to cause, at their discretion, material foreign subsidiaries to be joined as guarantors of the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement.\n  * On June 3, 2024, Inotiv, Inc. announced that it had reached agreement with the DOJ to resolve a previously-announced criminal investigation into its shuttered canine breeding facility located in Cumberland, Virginia, which was operated originally by Envigo RMS, LLC, an entity acquired by the Company in November 2021.\n  * The Company continued to execute on its site optimization plan for its Blackthorn, U.K. site, which the Company is leasing back until its operations are relocated to its Hillcrest, U.K. site. The relocation of operating activities from Blackthorn into its Hillcrest, U.K. site have been completed and the Company plans to exit the leased facility by the end of September 2024.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results (Three Months Ended June 30, 2024)**\n\n**Revenue** decreased 32.8% to $105.8 million in Q3 FY 2024 as compared to $157.5 million in Q3 FY 2023. The lower total revenue in the second quarter was primarily driven by a $49.1 million decrease in RMS revenue and a $2.5 million decrease in DSA revenue. The decrease in RMS revenue was primarily due to the lower non-human primate (\"NHP\") related product and service revenue of $45.7 million mainly as a result of product volumes and pricing. Additionally, in Q3 FY 2024, there was a decrease of $3.0 million in RMS revenue as a result of the sale of our Israeli businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\n**Operating loss** was $20.8 million in Q3 FY 2024 as compared to operating income of $8.8 million in Q3 FY 2023. The higher total operating loss in Q3 FY 2024 was primarily due to the decrease in RMS revenue, partially offset by a decrease of $18.0 million in RMS cost of revenue1 and a decrease of $1.6 million in RMS operating expenses. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily driven by a $17.3 million reduction of NHP-related cost of revenue1 and the impact of the sale of our Israeli businesses of $2.1 million. The decrease in operating expenses2 was primarily related to the $1.1 million decrease in provision of expected credit losses in addition to decreases in restructuring costs, severance, remediation costs and legal and professional fees, partially offset by the $2.0 million charge related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** as of June 30, 2024, was $14.4 million and there were no borrowings on the Company’s $15.0 million revolving credit facility. Total debt, net of debt issuance costs, as of June 30, 2024, was $382.4 million. As of the date of this release, the Company has borrowings of $12.0 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility. On August 7, 2024, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment (the \"Sixth Amendment\") to the Credit Agreement, which waives the financial covenant tests for the quarter ending June 30, 2024.\n\n**Year-to-Date Fiscal 2024 Financial Results (Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024)**\n\n**Revenue** decreased 16.5% to $360.3 million in YTD FY 2024 as compared to $431.7 million in YTD FY 2023. The lower total revenue in YTD FY 2024 was primarily driven by a $72.0 million decrease in RMS revenue due primarily to the negative impact of lower NHP sales of $58.2 million. Additionally, there was a decrease of $8.9 million in RMS revenue as a result of the sale of our Israeli businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The remaining decrease in RMS revenue was due primarily to decreases in small animal sales and RMS services in the U.S., partially offset by an increase in diets and bedding sales.\n\n**Operating loss** was $73.2 million in YTD FY 2024 as compared to $83.9 million in YTD FY 2023. The lower total operating loss in YTD FY 2024 was primarily due to a $66.4 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our RMS segment in YTD FY 2023 that did not recur in YTD FY 2024, partially offset by the $28.5 million charge incurred during YTD FY 2024 related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** of $14.4 million at June 30, 2024, compares to $35.5 million at September 30, 2023, the end of fiscal year 2023. Cash used by operating activities was $4.4 million for YTD FY 2024, which includes the June 3, 2024 payments of $6.5 million related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $9.1 million for YTD FY 2023. For YTD FY 2024, capital expenditures totaled $17.0 million compared to $21.3 million for YTD FY 2023.\n\n1Cost of revenue includes cost of services provided and cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets2Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\n  * On July 23, 2024, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida informed the Company that it was no longer investigating the Company or its subsidiaries with respect to their procurement of NHPs from foreign suppliers or NHP importation practices.\n  * On August 7, 2024, the Company, certain subsidiaries and the lenders party thereto entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment among other changes, waives the financial covenant tests set out under the Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, establishes a new weekly liquidity reporting requirement to the lenders, and establishes a new minimum weekly liquidity requirement of $7.0 million for the weeks ending August 16, 2024, August 23, 2024 and August 30, 2024, $17.5 million for the weeks ending October 11, 2024, October 18, 2024 and October 25, 2024 and $10.0 million for each other week thereafter.\n\n\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Thursday, August 8, 2024, at 4:30 pm ET to discuss third quarter fiscal 2024 results.\n\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing:\n\n  * (800) 225-9448 (Domestic)\n  * (203) 518-9708 (International)\n  * \"Inotiv\" (Conference ID)\n\n\n\nThe live conference call webcast will be accessible in the Investors section of the Company’s web site and directly via the following link:\n\n[https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1677787&tp_key=b286b1a375](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=thb8rnlQVCGULNKf0b3PpIaX4XIhZTwcEFgYtEDbRTvn5OXkIv4MWvP_zRpZGJaulgkRgQJie1o1nTorixBEYQ_0mG8R1FgfuW-fwOOCqCpQJ-uRtqVVFTxFqzCIvpwXuHeWVfH-zgpM9ivXvpHwCPEWcn3jyfXpYM-LgWh3CqfDZqomGDa8AIG7fJOwXuIx06qGKCDc46cvKYKYOPi6-FPfdDGaBnjkWcjAENNTedM=)\n\nFor those who cannot listen to the live broadcast, an online replay will be available in the Investors section of Inotiv’s web site at: [https://www.inotivco.com/investors/investor-information/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=thb8rnlQVCGULNKf0b3PpO4SbU49AC4I4WkbcUS_8dufPTHONnlzQ4-YO5kg9EQqm3O5liQ_mKtmKbMVFA2LsvCwLh9EDNusAyv-x-UJoAmi93ahoef33hcwYWdoPEMKN-tdNpLyP2j3qigL6bmbAtBd-eE9uCSWvObNcmzs_lZBVp2rJOHdGy3UFAnWDux3). \n\n**Non-GAAP to GAAP Reconciliation**\n\nThis press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), including Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and selected business segment information for those periods. Adjusted EBITDA as reported herein refers to a financial measure that excludes from consolidated net loss, statements of operations line items interest expense and income tax benefit, as well as non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, acquisition and integration costs, startup costs, restructuring costs, unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss, amortization of inventory step up (gain) loss on disposition of assets, other unusual, third party costs, the charge in connection with the Resolution and Plea Agreements and goodwill impairment loss. The adjusted business segment information excludes from operating loss and unallocated corporate operating expenses for these same expenses.\n\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, they may help investors evaluate the Company’s ongoing operations. They can assist in making meaningful period-over-period comparisons and in identifying operating trends that would otherwise be masked or distorted by the items subject to the adjustments. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures as supplemental and in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.Management has chosen to provide this supplemental information to investors, analysts, and other interested parties to enable them to perform additional analyses of our results and to illustrate our results giving effect to the non-GAAP adjustments. Management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and cautions investors that the non-GAAP measures used by the Company may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\n\n**About the Company**\n\nInotiv, Inc. is a leading contract research organization dedicated to providing nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services and research models and related products and services.

STATEMENTS\n(amounts in thousands except share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)\n(unaudited)\n1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nInotiv, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” and “Inotiv”) comprise a leading contract research organization (“CRO”) dedicated to\nproviding nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries and selling a range of\nresearch-quality animals and diets to the same industries as well as academia and government clients. Our products and services focus on bringing new drugs\nand medical devices through the discovery and preclinical phases of development, all while increasing efficiency, improving data, and reducing the cost of\ndiscovering and taking new drugs and medical devices to market. Inotiv is committed to supporting discovery and development objectives as well as helping\nresearchers realize the full potential of their critical research and development projects, all while working together to build a healthier and safer world. We are\ndedicated to practicing high standards of laboratory animal care and welfare.\nAs a result of our strategic acquisition of Envigo RMS Holding Corp. in November 2021, which added a complementary research model platform, our full\nspectrum solutions span two segments: Discovery and Safety Assessment (“DSA”) and Research Models and Services (“RMS”).\nThrough our DSA segment, we support the discovery, nonclinical development and clinical development needs of researchers and clinicians for primarily small\nmolecule drug candidates, as well as biotherapeutics and biomedical devices. Our scientists have skills in analytical instrumentation development, chemistry,\ncomputer software development, histology, pathology, physiology, surgery, analytical chemistry, drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology to make\nthe services and products we provide increasingly valuable to our current and potential clients. Our principal clients are companies whose scientists are\nengaged in analytical chemistry, drug safety evaluation, clinical trials, drug metabolism studies, pharmacokinetics and basic research, from small start-up\nbiotechnology companies to some of the largest global pharmaceutical companies.\nThrough our RMS segment, we offer access to a wide range of small and large research models for basic research and drug discovery and development, as well\nas specialized models for specific diseases and therapeutic areas in addition to diet and bedding. We combine deep animal husbandry expertise and expanded\naccess to scientists across the discovery and preclinical continuum, which reduces nonclinical lead times and provides enhanced project delivery. In\nconjunction with our DSA business, we have the ability to run selected nonclinical studies directly on-site at closely located research model facilities and\nprovide access to innovative genetically engineered models and services solutions. Our principal clients include biopharmaceutical companies, CROs, and\nacademic and government organizations.\nResolution and Plea Agreements\nOn June 3, 2024, Inotiv, Inc. announced that it had reached agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to resolve a previously-announced criminal\ninvestigation into its shuttered canine breeding facility located in Cumberland, Virginia, which was operated originally by Envigo RMS, LLC (“Envigo RMS”),\nan entity acquired by the Company in November 2021. In connection with such resolution, the Company and its related entities have entered into a Resolution\nAgreement (the “Resolution Agreement”) with the DOJ and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia (“USAO-WDV”), and\nEnvigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, Inc. (“EGSI” and together with Envigo RMS, “Envigo”) have entered into a Plea Agreement (the “Plea Agreement”)\nwith the DOJ and the USAO-WDV. On June 3, 2024, before the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to\none misdemeanor count of conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act and EGSI pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to violate the Clean Water\nAct. While the terms of the resolution are subject to Court approval at a sentencing hearing, which is currently scheduled for October 7, 2024, the obligations\nof the Company and Envigo under the Resolution Agreement, the Plea Agreement and related documents apply beginning on the date of execution of June 3,\n2024. Refer to Note 14 – Contingencies for additional information.\nPursuant to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement, the Company and Envigo, among other matters, have agreed to: (i) make payments totaling\n$22,000 in fines, with $5,000 payable on each of June 3, 2025, 2026 and 2027, and $7,000 (plus accrued interest beginning on the sentencing date) payable on\nJune 3, 2028; (ii) on June 3, 2024, pay $3,000, split between the Virginia Animal Fighting Taskforce and the Humane Society of the United States in\nrecognition of\n11\nTable of Contents\nassistance provided to the U.S. Government’s investigation; (iii) on June 3, 2024, pay $3,500 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to fund\nenvironmental projects, studies, and initiatives in Cumberland County, Virginia; (iv) expend at least $7,000 ($2,500 by June 3, 2025, $2,500 by June 3, 2026,\nand $2,000 by June 3, 2027) for improvements to its facilities and personnel related to the welfare of animals; (v) provide a lien to the United States against\nsufficient Company assets to secure the deferred payments in connection with the $22,000 fine, which lien will be junior to only the lien provided by the\nCompany to lenders under its credit facility as of April 1, 2024 and additional liens to secure up to $100,000 of additional debt; (vi) meet specified standards\nwith respect to the health, safety and well-being of animals under the Company’s care; (vii) develop, adopt, implement, fund and comply with a comprehensive\nnationwide compliance plan related to applicable laws; and (viii) the appointment of a Compliance Monitor to review the Company’s care of animals and\ncompliance with certain laws, and to pay all associated costs, which Compliance Monitor shall serve for a term that expires five years after the completion of\nthe selection process for the Compliance Monitor, unless Envigo is released from probation prior to completion of the five-year term, in which case the\nmonitorship term shall expire three years after the completion of the selection process, or two months after the completion of probation, whichever is later. In\naddition, the pleas result in Envigo RMS and EGSI being subject to probation for up to five years, with the potential to end the term early at a minimum of\nthree years if the Company complies with the elements of the resolution.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company has expensed $28,500 related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements, which is presented within other\noperating expense in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In line with the Resolution and Plea Agreements, the Company paid\n$6,500 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and expects to pay an additional $22,000 over multiple years. Accordingly, the Company has included\n$5,000 in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and within “Changes in operating\nassets and liabilities – accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended June\n30, 2024 and the Company has included $17,000 in other long-term liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and “Changes\nin operating assets and liabilities – other assets and liabilities” in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended June 30,\n2024. The total $28,500 charge is reflected in the operating loss of the RMS segment. The charge of $28,500 is non-deductible for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Further, the Fifth Amendment (as defined in Note 6 - Debt), among other changes to the Credit Agreement, permits charges or expenses attributable\nto or related to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement to be added back to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA in an amount up to $28,500 for\npurposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. The Company expects to have additional cash outlays in connection with certain costs related\nto the Resolution Agreement, which would be paid over the next three to five years. The additional cash outlays could include ongoing monitoring and\ncompliance costs, legal expenses and other payments required to comply with the Resolution Agreement, subject to final approvals, and at this time, the\nCompany expects that such costs would be expensed as incurred.\nOperational Update\nOn November 16, 2022, the Company became aware that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) had criminally\ncharged employees of the principal supplier of non-human primates (\"NHPs\") to the Company, along with two Cambodian government officials, with\nconspiring to illegally import NHPs into the U.S. from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with seven specific imports between July 2018\nand December 2021 (the \"November 16, 2022 event\"). The Company has not been directed to refrain from selling the Cambodian NHPs in its possession in the\nU.S. However, due to the allegations contained in the indictment involving the supplier and the Cambodian government officials, the Company believed that it\nwas prudent, at the time, to refrain from selling or delivering any of its Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. until the Company’s staff and external experts could\nevaluate what additionally could be done to satisfy itself that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia can be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred.\nHistorically, the Company relied on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (“CITES”) documentation and\nrelated processes and procedures, including release of each import by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. After a thorough review of the documentation we have\nfor the Cambodian NHPs in our inventory and their colonies, we resumed shipping Cambodian NHPs. In addition, we completed audits on site at our\nCambodian supplier and we worked to establish even more robust procedures for future imports. Inotiv has continued to monitor and respond to the evolving\nenvironment around non-human primates. Although Cambodia has remained closed as a source through the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we have identified and\nextensively audited multiple additional sources of purpose-bred animals that can be made available for life-saving medical research. This has allowed us to\ndiversify our sourcing of NHPs outside of Cambodia to satisfy demand at our DSA business segment and to our RMS clients. In addition, we have developed,\nand sourced, novel genetic testing techniques to further bolster our auditing capabilities to\n12\nTable of Contents\ndetermine whether the animals we import are purpose-bred, and we are assessing the ability to introduce these techniques into our supply chain.\nNHPs are critical for scientific research and are required by international regulatory guidance to develop and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a range of\nlife-saving drugs and treatments prior to their assessment in human clinical trials. Without a consistent source of NHP’s in the U.S., Drug discovery and\ndevelopment in the U.S. could be materially impacted.\nNHP imports into the U.S. for drug discovery significantly declined from 2022 to 2023. The decrease in overall NHP supply drove an increase in pricing in\n2023. Furthermore, we now believe the decreased U.S. NHP supply caused some studies to be shifted outside of the U.S. We also believe some clients\nincreased their inventory levels of NHP’s during 2023 and therefore recently, clients appear to be utilizing existing NHP inventory without purchasing\nhistorical levels of NHPs. RMS revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due\nprimarily to lower NHP-related product and service revenue of $45,667. For the 2024 period, the reduction in sales volumes adversely affected our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2022 and 2023 there were decreases in biotech funding which contributed to a reduced demand for preclinical studies. While U.S. biotech funding\nincreased in the first half of calendar 2024, the Company has yet to see a meaningful increase in demand from biotech clients.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\"GAAP\") applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $14,434 and access to a $15,000 revolver, which had no balance\noutstanding as of June 30, 2024 and a $12,000 balance outstanding as of the date of this report. The proceeds from the recent draw on the revolver were used\nfor working capital demands, such as timing of an NHP deposit. The November 16, 2022 event and subsequent decision to refrain from selling or delivering\nCambodian NHPs held in the U.S. triggered a material adverse event clause in our Credit Agreement discussed in Note 6 - Debt to these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements resulting in, among other things, a limitation of our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. The loss of access to our\nrevolving credit facility at the time and reduced liquidity resulting from the decision to refrain from selling Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. resulted in\nreduced forecasted liquidity. As a result of these events, the Company took steps to improve its liquidity, which included negotiating an amendment to its\nCredit Agreement in January 2023 to reinstate its ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility. Without the amendment, the Company was at the time at\nrisk of not having the revolving credit facility available.\nIn 2023, we implemented several initiatives to integrate and optimize several of the facilities we acquired through acquisitions in 2021 and 2022. The initiatives\nincluded significant investments in existing facilities and were also designed to enhance animal welfare and customer experience, reduce our operating costs\nand provide additional scale and create efficiencies in our remaining operations. Additionally, we identified and have been implementing new strategies to\nimprove the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the transportation of our products. We announced several site consolidation plans in the U.S. and certain\nEuropean and U.K. sites. Our site optimization plans allow us to reduce overhead and create efficiencies through scale. During fiscal 2023, we completed all\nplanned fiscal year 2023 consolidations and closures and sold our Israeli businesses. The consolidation of the operations at our Blackthorn, U.K., facility with\nthe operations in Hillcrest, U.K., is complete as of the date of this report and we expect to exit the leased facility before the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2024. Over the last year, we have continued to improve our infrastructure and worked to optimize our operating platform to support future growth. These\nimprovements included investments in our information technology platforms, building program management functions to enhance management and\ncommunication with clients and multi-site programs, further enhancing client services and improving the client experience. We believe the actions taken and\ninvestments made in recent periods form a solid foundation upon which we can continue to build. However, there is no assurance that such actions will\nultimately have the intended effects.\nIn connection with the site optimizations noted above and other restructuring initiatives, we reduced our workforce. We also took steps to reduce our budgeted\ncapital expenditures and certain forecasted expenses, including a reduction of nonessential travel and employee-related expenses among other efficiency-based\nreductions. Additionally, we identified\n13\nTable of Contents\nand executed new strategies to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the transportation of our products. In December 2023, we announced that we\nwould be partnering with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC, a provider of our transportation services, to enable the in-house integration of our North\nAmerican transportation operations. By taking direct control of our transportation operations, we believe we have achieved key efficiencies to strengthen\ninternal operations, improve our outgoing supply chain, and bolster service and scientific continuity for clients. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we\ncompleted the in-house integration of our North American transportation operations as described above. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany worked on route optimization projects, which are designed for further efficiencies and cost reductions and is continuing to work on route\noptimization projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThe financial covenants under the Company's Credit Agreement include, among others, a requirement to not permit the consolidated debt to consolidated\nEBITDA of the Company to exceed certain leverage thresholds under the Credit Agreement. On June 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment\nto the Credit Agreement, which provides that any charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements may be added back to\nthe Company’s consolidated EBITDA (up to $28,500) for purposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of the date of filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to the decrease in the Company's revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events) to the Credit Agreement, which waives the testing of the secured\nleverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants thereunder as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the unexpected shift in NHP demand as\ndiscussed in the Operational Update above, there is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in revenue for the remainder of the 2024 fiscal\nyear. If the Company's revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit\nAgreement beginning with the September 30, 2024 test date. If at the time the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K it reports a failure to comply\nwith its financial covenants which remains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, this would constitute an event of default\nunder the Credit Agreement and the lenders may, among other remedies set out under the Credit Agreement, declare all or any portion of the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, if the lenders were to accelerate the\nloans under the Credit Agreement, such acceleration would constitute a default under our indenture governing the Company's Convertible Senior Notes (the\n\"Notes\") which, if not cured within 30 days following notice of such default from the trustee or holders of 25 percent of the Notes, would permit the trustee or\nsuch holders to accelerate the Notes. If the lenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, the Company does not believe its existing cash and cash\nequivalents, together with cash generated from operations, would be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned\ntargeted capital expenditures, and repay the entirety of its outstanding senior term loans, repay the entirety of its outstanding Notes and repay the entirety of the\n$12,000 balance of the revolving credit facility in the next twelve months. Additionally, access to the revolver would be restricted and such funds would not be\navailable to pay for any operating activities.\nOur evaluation of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles entailed analyzing\nprospective fully implemented operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of our cash needs and comparing those needs to the current cash and cash\nequivalent balances in order to satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and to comply with minimum\nliquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve\nmonths. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented\nand are outside of its control as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the\nmitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s\nplans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial\nstatements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about\nthe entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. After\nconsidering the factors outlined above, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\nWe plan to continue our efforts to optimize our capital allocation and expense base, which reduced our cash expenses in the three and nine months ended June\n30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and which are expected to continue to reduce cash expenses in the remainder of fiscal\n2024 and into fiscal 2025. Further, we have invested and plan to continue to invest in our DSA capacity and added to our service offerings in recent periods\nwhich we plan to utilize in order to support future revenue growth and margins. The Company also continues to collaborate with its\n14\nTable of Contents\nlenders with regard to its current business conditions. The Company plans to request amendments to the Credit Agreement, which may include potential\nadditional financial covenant requirements, in an effort to avoid an acceleration of the loans under the Credit Agreement prior to their existing maturity. In the\nevent that the Company fails to comply with the requirements of the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company has approximately 55\ndays subsequent to any fiscal quarter, and approximately 100 days subsequent to fiscal year-end to cure noncompliance (the \"grace period\"). Additionally, the\nCompany has and may continue to seek additional financing and evaluate financing alternatives to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months. There is\nno assurance that the Company’s lenders will agree to any amendment to the Credit Agreement, nor can there be any assurance that the Company would be\nable to raise additional capital, whether through selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan on terms acceptable to the\nCompany or at all.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company has prepared the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes\nrequired by GAAP, and therefore should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included\nin the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 include all adjustments which are necessary for a fair\npresentation of the results of the interim periods and of the Company’s financial position at June 30, 2024. The results of operations for the three and nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Certain prior year amounts have been\nreclassified within the condensed consolidated statements of operations and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for consistency with the\ncurrent year presentation. Specifically, depreciation expense has been combined with amortization of intangible assets. These reclassifications had no effect on\nthe reported results of operations. Further, certain financing activities have been reclassified within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for\nconsistency with the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that may\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These include, but are not\nlimited to, management estimates in the calculation and timing of revenue recognition, pension liabilities, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related\nvaluation allowance. Although estimates are based upon management’s best estimate using historical experience, current events, and actions, actual results\ncould differ from those estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results in the period in which they become known.\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared by the Company, including all subsidiaries and prior to\nDecember 23, 2023, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) it previously consolidated in accordance with GAAP. During December 2023, the Company entered into\na transition services agreement with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC, one of the Company's transportation providers, to enable the in-house integration\nof Inotiv’s North American transportation operations. Following this transaction, Inotiv was no longer required to consolidate this entity. The VIE has not\nmaterially impacted our net assets or net loss. The Company successfully completed the in-house integration of its North American transportation operations\nduring the second fiscal quarter of 2024.\nThe Company accounts for noncontrolling interests in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810”). ASC\n810 requires companies with noncontrolling interests to disclose such interests as a portion of equity but separate from the parent’s equity. The noncontrolling\ninterests’ portion of net loss is presented on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Company’s Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, and there have been no material changes to those significant accounting policies.\n15\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables from customers in the\nbiopharmaceutical, contract research, academic, and governmental sectors. The Company believes its exposure to credit risk is minimal, as the majority of the\ncustomers are predominantly well established and viable. Additionally, the Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses. The Company’s exposure\nto credit loss in the event that payment is not received for revenue recognized equals the outstanding trade receivables and contract assets less fees invoiced in\nadvance.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, no clients accounted for more than 10% of sales. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, one client\naccounted for 16.1% of sales. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, one client accounted for 19.7% and 22.5% of sales, respectively. During\nthe three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, no vendors accounted for more than 10% of the sum of cost of services and cost of products.\n2. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nDSA\nThe DSA segment generates service revenue through drug discovery and development services. The DSA segment generates product revenue through\ninternally-manufactured scientific instruments for life sciences research and the related software for use by pharmaceutical companies, universities,\ngovernment research centers and medical research institutions under the Company’s BASi product line.\nRMS\nThe RMS segment generates product revenue through the commercial production, procurement and sale of research models, diets and bedding and bioproducts.\nThe RMS segment generates service revenue through Genetically Engineered Models and Services (\"GEMS\"), client-owned animal colony care, and health\nmonitoring and diagnostics services related to research models.\nContract Assets and Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed receivables (trade receivables), contract assets (unbilled revenue), and contract\nliabilities (customer deposits and deferred revenue) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The following table provides information about contract\nassets (trade receivables and unbilled revenue, excluding allowances for credit losses), and fees invoiced in advance (customer deposits and deferred revenue):\nBalance at Balance at\nJune 30, September 30,\n2024 2023\nContract assets: Trade receivables $ 53,737 $ 77,618\nContract assets: Unbilled revenue 15,910 17,211\nContract liabilities: Customer deposits 22,374 36,689\nContract liabilities: Deferred revenue 16,321 18,933\nWhen the Company does not have the unconditional right to advanced billings, both advanced client payments and unpaid advanced client billings are\nexcluded from deferred revenue, with the advanced billings also being excluded from client receivables. The Company excluded approximately $10,807 and\n$10,220 of unpaid advanced client billings from both client receivables and deferred revenue as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company expects a majority of deferred revenue to be recognized as revenue within twelve months.\n16\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the contract asset and the contract liability balances during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 include the following:\n• Changes in the time frame for a right for consideration to become unconditional – approximately 79.0% of unbilled revenue as of September 30, 2023,\nwas billed during the nine months ended June 30, 2024; and\n• Changes in the time frame for a performance obligation to be satisfied – approximately 75.0% of deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, was\nrecognized as revenue during the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\n3. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nSegment Information\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the RMS segment reported intersegment revenue of $396 and $5,230, respectively, related to sales to\nthe DSA segment. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the RMS segment reported intersegment revenue of $3,471 and $7,858, respectively,\nrelated to sales to the DSA segment.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The guidance requires consideration given, including contingent\nconsideration, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests to be valued at their fair market values at the acquisition date. The guidance\nfurther provides that: (1) in-process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset; (2) acquisition costs will\ngenerally be expensed as incurred; (3) restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date;\nand (4) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense\n(benefit). ASC 805 requires that any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangibles and liabilities\nassumed, be recognized as goodwill.\nHistion Acquisition\nOn April 25, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Histion, LLC (“Histion”), which was a strategic element of the Company’s expansion of its\nspecialized pathology services. Consideration for the Histion acquisition consisted of (i) $950 in cash, subject to working capital adjustments, (ii) 17,618 of the\nCompany’s common shares valued at $364 based on\n18\nTable of Contents\nthe closing stock price of the Company’s common shares as reported by Nasdaq on the closing date and (iii) unsecured subordinated promissory notes payable\nto the former shareholders of Histion in an aggregate principal amount of $433.\nProtypia Acquisition\nOn July 7, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Protypia, Inc. (“Protypia”), which was a strategic element of the Company’s\nexpansion of its mass spectrometry-based bioanalytical offerings, providing for the acquisition by the Company of all of the outstanding stock of Protypia on\nthat date. Consideration for the Protypia stock consisted of (i) $9,460 in cash, subject to certain adjustments, (ii) 74,997 of the Company's common shares\nvalued at $806 based on the opening stock price of the Company’s common shares as reported by Nasdaq on the closing date and (iii) $600 in seller notes.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\nJuly 7, 2022\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nGoodwill 6,002\nIntangible assets 5,600\nOther liabilities, net (84)\nDeferred tax liabilities (652)\n$ 10,866\nIntangible assets primarily relate to client relationships and technology associated with the ability to perform specialized protein and peptide mass spectrometry\nanalysis. The acquired definite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a weighted-average estimated useful life of approximately 8.1 years on a\nstraight-line basis. The estimated fair values of identifiable intangible assets were determined using the \"income approach,\" which is a valuation technique that\nprovides an estimate of the fair value of an asset based on market participant expectations of the cash flows an asset would generate over its remaining useful\nlife. Some of the significant assumptions inherent in the development of these asset valuations include the estimated net cash flows for each year for each asset\nor product (including revenues and EBITDA), the appropriate discount rate necessary to measure the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the life\ncycle of each asset, the potential regulatory and commercial success risk, and competitive trends impacting the asset and each cash flow stream, as well as other\nfactors.\nGoodwill, which is derived from the enhanced scientific expertise and our ability to provide broader service solutions through a comprehensive portfolio, is\nrecorded based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired and none is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill\nfrom this transaction is allocated to the Company’s DSA reportable segment.\nIn accordance with ASC 805-740, the Company established a deferred tax liability with an offset to goodwill in connection with the accounting for the opening\nbalance sheet of the Protypia acquisition as a result of book-to-tax differences primarily related to the intangible assets.\n19\nTable of Contents\n5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table displays intangible assets, net by major class:\nJune 30, 2024\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying\nAmount, Gross Amortization Amount, Net\nClient relationships $ 317,026 $ (75,585) $ 241,441\nIntellectual property 56,362 (17,077) 39,285\nOther 4,837 (3,023) 1,814\n$ 378,225 $ (95,685) $ 282,540\nSeptember 30, 2023\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying\nAmount, Gross Amortization Amount, Net\nClient relationships $ 316,820 $ (54,711) $ 262,109\nIntellectual property 56,337 (12,234) 44,103\nOther 4,837 (2,621) 2,216\n$ 377,994 $ (69,566) $ 308,428\nThe decrease in intangible assets, net during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 related to amortization over the applicable useful lives, partially offset by the\nimpact of foreign exchange rates.\n6. DEBT\nLong-term debt as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is detailed in the table below.\nJune 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSeller Note – Bolder BioPath (Related party) $ 432 $ 602\nSeller Note – Preclinical Research Services 484 541\nSeller Payable - Orient BioResource Center 3,690 3,649\nSeller Note – Histion (Related party) 120 229\nSeller Note – Protypia (Related party) — 400\nEconomic Injury Disaster Loan — 140\nConvertible Senior Notes 115,296 110,651\nTerm Loan Facility, DDTL and Incremental Term Loans 274,048 272,930\nTotal debt before unamortized debt issuance costs $ 394,070 $ 389,142\nLess: Debt issuance costs not amortized (11,623) (11,397)\nTotal debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs $ 382,447 $ 377,745\nLess: Current portion (378,550) (7,950)\nTotal Long-term debt $ 3,897 $ 369,795\nAs of the date of filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to the decrease in the Company's revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events) to the Credit Agreement, which waives the testing of the secured\nleverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants thereunder as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the unexpected shift in NHP demand as\ndiscussed in the Operational Update above, there is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in revenue for the remainder\n20\nTable of Contents\nof the 2024 fiscal year. If the Company's revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would result in non-compliance with the financial covenants\nunder the Credit Agreement beginning with the September 30, 2024 test date. If at the time the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K it reports a\nfailure to comply with its financial covenants which remains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, this would constitute an\nevent of default under the Credit Agreement and the lenders may, among other remedies set out under the Credit Agreement, declare all or any portion of the\noutstanding principal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, if the lenders were to\naccelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, such acceleration would constitute a default under our indenture governing the Company's Convertible Senior\nNotes (the \"Notes\") which, if not cured within 30 days following notice of such default from the trustee or holders of 25 percent of the Notes, would permit the\ntrustee or such holders to accelerate the Notes. Refer to Note 1 - Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation for the Company's Operational Update\nand the Company's analysis of Liquidity and Going Concern.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility. Refer to the statements of cash flows\nfor information related to payments on the revolving credit facility during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. As of the date of this report, there is a $12,000\nbalance under the revolving credit facility.\nSignificant Transactions\nOn October 12, 2022, the Company drew its $35,000 delayed draw term loan (the “Additional DDTL”) allowed under the First Amendment to the Credit\nAgreement (“First Amendment”). A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the $15,000 balance on the Company’s revolving credit facility, while the\nremaining amount was drawn to fund a portion of the Company’s capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 and those planned for fiscal year 2023.\nOn December 29, 2022 and January 9, 2023, the Company, the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), entered\ninto the Second and Third Amendments, respectively, to the Credit Agreement. Refer below for further information related to those amendments.\nOn May 14, 2024 and June 2, 2024, the Company, the lenders party thereto, and the Agent, entered into the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively, to the\nCredit Agreement. Refer below for further information related to those amendments.\nAbsent the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events), the Company would not have complied with its financial covenants under the Credit\nAgreement and the Company believes that if it does not see an increase in revenue, and related operating margins, it is probable that the Company will fail its\nfinancial covenants within twelve months of the balance sheet date. As a result, we have classified the Term Loan Facility, DDTL and Incremental Term Loans\n(each as defined below) and the Notes as current. Refer to Note 1 - Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation for the Company's Operational\nUpdate and the Company's analysis of Liquidity and Going Concern.\nTerm Loan Facility, DDTL and Incremental Term Loans\nBelow are the weighted-average effective interest rates for the loans available under the Credit Agreement (as defined below):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEffective interest rates:\nTerm Loan 11.67 % 10.25 % 11.43 % 10.29 %\nInitial DDTL 11.66 % 10.22 % 11.41 % 10.31 %\nAdditional DDTL 11.78 % 10.35 % 11.54 % 10.47 %\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 5, 2021, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), the lenders party thereto, and the Agent, entered into\na Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") in the original principal amount of\n$165,000, a delayed draw term loan facility in the\n21\nTable of Contents\noriginal principal amount of $35,000 (available to be drawn up to 18 months from the date of the Credit Agreement) (the “Initial DDTL” and together with the\nAdditional DDTL, the “DDTL”) and a revolving credit facility in the original principal amount of $15,000. On November 5, 2021, the Company borrowed the\nfull amount of the term loan facility, but did not borrow any amounts on the delayed draw term loan facility or the revolving credit facility.\nThe Company could have elected to borrow on each of the loan facilities at either an adjusted LIBOR rate of interest or an adjusted prime rate of interest.\nAdjusted LIBOR rate loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin of between 6.00% and 6.50%, depending on the\nCompany’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The LIBOR rate had to be a minimum of 1.00%. The initial adjusted\nLIBOR rate of interest was the LIBOR rate plus 6.25%. Adjusted prime rate loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus a margin of\nbetween 5.00% and 5.50%, depending on the Company’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio. The initial adjusted prime rate of interest was the prime rate\nplus 5.25%.\nThe Company must pay (i) a fee based on a percentage per annum equal to 0.50% on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the\nrevolving credit facility and (ii) a fee based on a percentage per annum equal to 1.00% on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of\nthe delayed draw loan facility. In each case, such fee shall be paid quarterly in arrears.\nEach of the term loan facility and delayed draw term loan facility require annual principal payments in an amount equal to 1.00% of their respective original\nprincipal amounts. The Company shall also repay the term loan facility on an annual basis in an amount equal to a percentage of its Excess Cash Flow (as\ndefined in the Credit Agreement), which percentage will be determined by its then current Secured Leverage Ratio. Each of the loan facilities may be repaid at\nany time.

The Notes were issued\npursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of September 27, 2021, among the Company, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, BAS\nEvansville, Inc., as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”). Pursuant to the purchase agreement between\nthe Company and the initial purchaser of the Notes, the Company granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days\nfrom, and including, the date the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $15,000 principal amount of the Notes. The Notes issued on September 27, 2021\nincluded $15,000 principal amount of the Notes issued pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchaser of such option. The Company used the net proceeds\nfrom the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the\nEnvigo acquisition and related fees and expenses.\nThe Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured\nindebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively\nsubordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv)\nstructurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder\nthereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis,\nby the Guarantor.\nThe Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2022.\nThe Notes will mature on October 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before April 15, 2027, noteholders have the right to convert\ntheir Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after April 15, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the\nclose of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as\napplicable, cash, its common shares or a combination of cash and its common shares, at the Company’s election. The initial conversion rate is 21.7162 common\nshares per $1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $46.05 per common share. The conversion rate and\nconversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-\nWhole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of\ntime.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were $3,468 and $4,172, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Notes. For the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the total interest expense was $2,948, including coupon interest expense of $1,131, accretion expense of $1,580, and the\namortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $237. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the total interest expense was $2,726, including\ncoupon interest expense of $1,071, accretion expense of $1,436, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $219. For the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the total interest expense was $8,755, including coupon interest expense of $3,406, accretion expense of $4,645, and the amortization of debt\ndiscount and issuance costs of $704. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the total interest expense was $8,229, including coupon interest expense of\n$3,371, accretion expense of $4,200, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $658.\nThe Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at the Company’s option at any time on or after October 15, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled\ntrading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per common share of the Company exceeds 130.00% of the conversion\nprice on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day\nimmediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such\nnotice. The redemption price is a cash amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling the Notes for redemption pursuant to the provisions described in this paragraph will constitute a Make-\nWhole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time.\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then noteholders may require the Company to\nrepurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the Fundamental Change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the\nCompany and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common shares.\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of “Events of Default” (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain\npayment defaults on the Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Notes, are subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) the Company’s\nfailure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) the failure by the Company or the Guarantor to comply with certain\ncovenants in the Indenture relating to the ability of the Company or the Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer,\nin one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole, to another person; (iv) a default by the Company or the Guarantor in its other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Notes if such default\nis not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by the Company, the Guarantor or any of their\nrespective subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $20,000; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against the Company, the\nGuarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries for the payment of at least $20,000, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after\nthe date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and\nreorganization involving the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective significant subsidiaries; and (viii) the guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full\nforce and effect (except as permitted by the Indenture) or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its guarantee of the Notes.\nIf an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to the Company or the Guarantor (and not solely with respect to a\nsignificant subsidiary of the Company or the Guarantor) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then\noutstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is\ncontinuing, then the trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 25.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice\nto the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due\nand payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating\nto certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive\nspecial interest on the Notes for up to 180 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% on the principal amount of the Notes.\nAt issuance, the Company evaluated the convertible feature of the Notes and determined it was required to be bifurcated as an embedded derivative and did not\nqualify for equity classification. In subsequent periods, the Notes conversion rights met all equity classification criteria and the fair value of the embedded\nderivative was reclassified to additional paid-in-capital. The discount resulting from the initial fair value of the embedded derivative has and will continue to be\namortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. Non-cash interest expense during the period primarily related to this discount.\n7.

The consolidation of operations at Gannat with the operations in Horst, the Netherlands was completed in June 2023 and initially met\nthe criteria for assets held for sale as of June 30, 2023. The Gannat facility was sold in December 2023. As of June 30, 2023, the real property of the Blackthorn\nfacility initially met the criteria for assets held for sale. The Blackthorn facility sold in February 2024, which the Company is leasing back until the operations\nare relocated to its Hillcrest, U.K. site. The consolidation of the operations at our Blackthorn, U.K., facility with the operations in Hillcrest, U.K., is complete\nas of the date of this report and we expect to exit the leased facility before the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.

The\nexits of the Boyertown and Haslett facilities were completed in March 2023 and both facilities initially met the criteria for assets held for sale as of March 31,\n2023. The Boyertown facility was sold in September 2023. The facility in Haslett was sold during April 2024.\nIsrael\nAs of December 31, 2022, the assets and liabilities related to the Israel RMS and Israel CRS businesses (the “Israeli Businesses”) initially met the held for sale\ncriteria and, in August 2023, the Company sold its ownership interest in the Israeli Businesses, which were previously reflected in the RMS reportable segment.\nConsideration for the sale consisted of (i) $1,000 in cash, (ii) an excess cash adjustment of $316, (iii) real property valued at $3,700, and (iv) a promissory note\nreceivable in the aggregate amount of $2,453.

LEASES\nThe Company records a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability for substantially all leases for which it is a lessee, in accordance with ASC 842. Leases\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes lease expense for the leases\non a straight-line basis over the lease term. At inception of a contract, the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether or not the\ncontract represents a lease by determining whether or not the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, either explicit or implicit, for a\nperiod of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company has various operating and finance leases for facilities and equipment. Facilities leases provide office, laboratory, warehouse, or land that the\nCompany uses to conduct its operations. Facilities leases range in duration from one to 21 years, with either renewal options for additional terms as the initial\nlease term expires, or purchase options. Facilities leases are considered as either operating or financing leases.\nEquipment leases provide for office equipment, laboratory equipment or services the Company uses to conduct its operations. Equipment leases range in\nduration from 21 to 84 months, with either subsequent annual renewals, additional terms as the initial lease term expires, or purchase options.\nROU lease assets and operating lease liabilities that are reported in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOperating ROU assets, net $ 45,216 $ 38,866\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 11,439 10,282\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 35,899 29,614\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 47,338 $ 39,896\nDuring the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had operating lease amortization of $2,191 and $6,546, respectively. During the three and\nnine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company had operating lease amortization of $2,067 and $6,469, respectively.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The components of lease expense related to the Company’s leases\nfor the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease costs:\nFixed operating lease costs $ 3,448 $ 2,800 $ 10,042 $ 8,714\nShort-term lease costs — 41 — 103\nLease income (753) (794) (2,311) (2,278)\nTotal operating lease cost $ 2,695 $ 2,047 $ 7,731 $ 6,539\nThe Company serves as lessor to a lessee in six facilities.

The gross rent receivables and underlying lease liabilities are presented gross in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n31\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nNine Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023\nCash flows included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 8,906 $ 8,397\nNon-cash lease activity:\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 12,858 $ 15,938\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for the Company’s operating leases as of June 30, 2024 and 2023 were:\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\nOperating lease 8.83 6.26\nWeighted-average discount rate (in percentages)\nOperating lease 11.92 % 7.98 %\nLease duration was determined utilizing renewal options that the Company is reasonably certain to execute.\nAs of June 30, 2024, maturities of operating lease liabilities for each of the following five fiscal years and a total thereafter were as follows:\nOperating Leases\n2024 (remainder of fiscal year) $ 3,147\n2025 10,159\n2026 10,340\n2027 8,375\n2028 6,859\nThereafter 47,846\nTotal minimum future lease payments 86,726\nLess interest (39,388)\nTotal lease liability 47,338\n12. EQUITY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nAuthorized Shares\nOn November 4, 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to\nincrease the number of authorized shares from 20,000,000 shares, consisting of 19,000,000 common shares and 1,000,000 preferred shares, to 75,000,000\nshares, consisting of 74,000,000 common shares and 1,000,000 preferred shares. Approval of this matter by the Inotiv shareholders was a condition to the\nclosing of the Envigo acquisition. The amendment was effective on November 4, 2021.\nOn March 14, 2024, the Company's shareholders approved the Inotiv, Inc. 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan provides for the\nissuance of up to 1,500,000 of the Company's common shares, plus the number of common shares remaining available for future grants under the Amended and\nRestated 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) as of March 14, 2024. Any common shares subject to an award under the 2024 Plan or 2018 Plan that\nexpires, is forfeited or cancelled, is settled for cash or exchanged will become available for future awards under the 2024 Plan. Following the shareholders'\napproval of the 2024 Plan, no further awards will be granted under the 2018 Plan. As of June 30, 2024, 1,798,668 shares remained available for grants under\nthe 2024 Plan.\n32\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company expenses the estimated fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units over the vesting periods of the grants. The Company\nrecognizes expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight-line attribution method and forfeitures, as they are incurred. Stock based\ncompensation expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $1,337 and $2,029, respectively. Stock based compensation expense for the\nnine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $5,118 and $5,856, respectively.\nLoss per Share\nThe Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The Company computes diluted\nearnings (loss) per share using the if-converted method for preferred shares and convertible debt, if any, and the treasury stock method for stock options and\nrestricted stock units.\nThe following table reconciles the numerator and denominator in the computations of basic and diluted loss per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nConsolidated net (loss) income $ (26,087) $ 365 $ (89,994) $ (96,196)\nLess: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests — (1,475) (440) (719)\nNet (loss) income attributable to common shareholders (26,087) 1,840 (89,554) (95,477)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - Basic (in thousands) 25,993 25,726 25,862 25,690\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards — 295 — —\nWeighted-average shares outstanding - Diluted 25,993 26,021 25,862 25,690\nAnti-dilutive common share equivalents (1) 5,451 5,494 5,451 5,790\n(1) Anti-dilutive common share equivalents are comprised of stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards and 3,040,268 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion in\nconnection with the convertible debt entered into on September 27, 2021.These common share equivalents were outstanding for the periods presented, but were not included in the computation\nof diluted loss per share for those periods because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.\n13. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable\nincome in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowances based on a\ndetermination of the expected realization of tax assets.\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 20.8% and 118.1%, respectively. For the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily driven by a change in the Company's forecasted loss before income taxes. For the three months\nended June 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was driven by a change in the Company's forecasted loss before income taxes, resulting in a catch up\nadjustment.\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.7% and 17.8%, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30,\n2024, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable permanent items related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements and valuation\nallowance adjustments. For the nine months ended\n33\nTable of Contents\nJune 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of non-deductible goodwill impairment and other discrete adjustments.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the\ntechnical merits of the position. The Company measures the amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists as the largest amount of benefit determined on\na cumulative probability basis that it believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement of the position. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had no\nmaterial liability for uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company records interest and penalties accrued in relation to the uncertain income tax position as a component of income tax expense (benefit). Any\nchanges in the liability for the uncertain tax position would impact the effective tax rate. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits to significantly change in the next twelve months.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and the various states and foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax regulations\nwithin each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. In the normal course\nof business, the Company is subject to examination by federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities. State and other income tax returns are generally\nsubject to examination for a period of three to five years after the filing of the respective returns. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax\nexaminations for years before 2020 or state and local tax examinations for years before 2019, with limited exceptions. For federal purposes, the tax attributes\ncarried forward could be adjusted through the examination process and are subject to examination three years from the date of utilization.\n14. CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nEnvigo RMS, LLC (“Envigo RMS”) is a defendant in a purported class action and a related action under California’s Private Attorney General Act of 2004\n(“PAGA”) brought by Jacob Greenwell, a former non-exempt employee of Envigo RMS, on June 25, 2021 in the Superior Court of California, Alameda\nCounty. The complaints allege that Envigo RMS violated certain wage and hour requirements under the California Labor Code. PAGA authorizes private\nattorneys to bring claims on behalf of the State of California and aggrieved employees for violations of California’s wage and hour laws. The class action\ncomplaint seeks certification of a class of similarly situated employees and the award of actual, consequential and incidental losses and damages for the alleged\nviolations. The PAGA complaint seeks civil penalties pursuant to the California Labor Code and attorney’s fees. On June 2, 2023, Envigo RMS and the plaintiff\nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) that sets forth the parties’ intent to settle these matters for $795 which includes attorneys’ fees. The MOU\nprovides that the parties will negotiate and enter into a definitive settlement agreement, which will be subject to court approval. The MOU contains no\nadmission of liability or wrongdoing by Envigo RMS. The MOU provides that, if the settlement is approved by the court, the settlement amount would be paid\nin four quarterly installments, with the first one to be funded after the court’s final approval of the settlement, and the following ones in the three subsequent\nquarters. The parties are in the process of finalizing the long-form settlement agreement. While the timeline for final court approval is not yet determined, the\nCompany took a reserve equal to the proposed settlement amount, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nOn June 23, 2022, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, naming the\nCompany and Robert W. Leasure and Beth A. Taylor as defendants, captioned Grobler v. Inotiv, Inc., et al., Case No. 4:22-cv-00045 (N.D. Ind.). The complaint\nalleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated\nthereunder, based on alleged false and misleading statements and material omissions regarding the Company’s acquisition of Envigo RMS and its regulatory\ncompliance. On September 12, 2022, Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System was appointed by the Court as lead plaintiff. Thereafter, on November\n14, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same defendants, in addition to John E. Sagartz and Carmen Wilbourn, that asserted the\nsame claims along with a claim under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. On November 23, 2022, the lead plaintiff filed a further amended complaint against\nthe aforementioned defendants asserting the same claims as the amended complaint and further alleging that false and misleading statements and material\nomissions were made concerning the Company’s non-human primate business. The purported class in the operative complaint includes all persons who\npurchased or otherwise acquired the Company’s common stock between September 21, 2021 and November 16, 2022, and the complaint seeks an unspecified\namount of monetary damages, interest, fees and expenses of attorneys and experts, and other relief. On January 27, 2023, the\n34\nTable of Contents\ndefendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion was fully briefed by April 28, 2023. On March 29, 2024, the Court issued a decision\ndenying, in part, Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The case is now in discovery. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter, the Company\nbelieves the class action to be without merit and plans to vigorously defend itself. We cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range\nof possible loss for this matter.\nOn September 9, 2022, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, naming\nRobert W. Leasure, Beth A. Taylor, Gregory C. Davis, R. Matthew Neff, Richard A. Johnson, John E. Sagartz, Nigel Brown, and Scott Cragg as defendants,\nand the Company as a nominal defendant, captioned Grobler v. Robert W. Leasure, et al., Case No. 4:22-cv-00064 (N.D. Ind.) (the “Grobler Derivative\nAction”). On January 4, 2023, an additional shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana,\nnaming Robert W. Leasure, Beth A. Taylor, Gregory C. Davis, R. Matthew Neff, Richard A. Johnson, John E. Sagartz, Nigel Brown, and Scott Cragg as\ndefendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant, captioned Burkhart v. Robert W. Leasure, et al., Case No 4:23-cv-00003 (N.D. Ind.) (the “Burkhart\nDerivative Action,” and together with the Grobler Derivative Action, the “Federal Derivative Actions”). The Federal Derivative Actions collectively assert\nclaims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets, as well as violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), and\n21D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 arising out of the Company’s acquisition of Envigo and its regulatory compliance. The Court entered orders on\nNovember 15, 2022 and May 8, 2023 in the Grobler and Burkhart Derivative Actions, respectively, staying each Action pending a resolution of a motion to\ndismiss in the securities class action. The stays expired following the March 29, 2024 decision on the motion to dismiss in the securities class action. The Court\nconsolidated the Federal Derivative Actions on April 24, 2024, and Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on June 24, 2024. The parties have jointly moved\nthe Court to stay litigation. That motion is currently pending. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, the Company believes the\nconsolidated Federal Derivative Actions to be without merit and plans to vigorously defend itself. We cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential\nexposure or the range of possible loss for any of these matters.\nOn April 20, 2023, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the State of Indiana Tippecanoe County Circuit Court, naming Robert W. Leasure,\nBeth A. Taylor, Gregory C. Davis, R. Matthew Neff, Richard A. Johnson, John E. Sagartz, Nigel Brown, and Scott Cragg as defendants, and the Company as a\nnominal defendant, captioned Whitfield v. Gregory C. Davis, et al., Case No. 79C01-2304-PL-000048 (Tippecanoe Circuit Court) (the “Whitfield Derivative\nAction”). On June 2, 2023, an additional shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Indiana Commercial Court of Marion County, naming Robert W.\nLeasure, Beth A. Taylor, Carmen Wilbourn, Gregory C. Davis, R. Matthew Neff, Richard A. Johnson, John E. Sagartz, Nigel Brown, and Scott Cragg as\ndefendants, and the Company as a nominal defendant, captioned Castro v. Robert W. Leasure, et al., Case No. 49D01-2306-PL-022213 (Marion Superior Court\n1) (the “Castro Derivative Action,” and together with the Whitfield Derivative Action, the “State Derivative Actions”). The State Derivative Actions\ncollectively assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and waste of corporate assets arising out\nof the Company’s acquisition of Envigo and its regulatory compliance, and the Company’s non-human primate business. On August 24, 2023, the Castro\nDerivative Action was transferred to the Tippecanoe County Circuit Court and consolidated with the Whitfield Derivative Action. The consolidated State\nDerivative Actions are currently stayed. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, the Company believes the consolidated State\nDerivative Actions to be without merit and plans to vigorously defend itself. We cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of\npossible loss for any of these matters.\nThe Company is party to certain other legal actions arising out of the normal course of its business. In management's opinion, none of these actions will have a\nmaterial effect on the Company's operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nGovernment Investigations and Actions\nThe Company is subject to and/or involved in various government investigations, inquiries and actions, including those described below. Given their inherent\nuncertainty, except as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict the duration or outcome of the pending matters described below. An adverse outcome of\nany of the following matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nDuring the period from July 2021 through March 2022, Envigo RMS’s Cumberland facility was inspected on several occasions by the U.S. Department of\nAgriculture (“USDA”). USDA issued inspection reports with findings of non-compliance with certain USDA laws and regulations. Envigo RMS formally\nappealed certain of the findings, and made multiple remediations and improvements at the Cumberland facility, of which it kept USDA apprised.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOn May 18, 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), together with federal and state law enforcement agents, executed a search and seizure warrant on\nthe Cumberland facility. The warrant was issued by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia on May 13, 2022. In 2022, Envigo Global\nServices, Inc. (\"EGSI\") and Inotiv received grand jury subpoenas and other requests from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia\n(“USAO-WDVA”) for documents and information related to the companies’ compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”),\nthe Virginia State Water Control Law and local pretreatment requirements from January 2017 to present. On July 23, 2023, EGSI and Inotiv received a grand\njury subpoena from USAO-WDVA for documents related to the Cumberland facility’s compliance with the Clean Air Act, Virginia Air Pollution Control Laws\nand Regulations, and local requirements from January 1, 2017 to present. Also on July 23, 2023, Inotiv received a grand jury subpoena from USAO-WDVA for\ndocuments and information related to the Company’s Alice, Texas facilities’ compliance with the CWA, the Texas State Water Control Law, and local\npretreatment requirements from January 1, 2020 to present. Certain current and former employees have also received subpoenas for testimony and documents\nrelated to these matters.\nOn June 3, 2024, the Company reached agreement to resolve this criminal investigation by the DOJ and other federal and state law enforcement agencies as to\nthe Company, EGSI and Envigo RMS. In connection with such resolution, the Company and its related entities have entered into a Resolution Agreement (the\n“Resolution Agreement”) with the DOJ and the USAO-WDVA, and Envigo RMS and EGSI have entered into a Plea Agreement (the “Plea Agreement”) with\nthe DOJ and the USAO-WDVA. On June 3, 2024, before the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to\none misdemeanor count of conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act and EGSI pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to violate the Clean Water\nAct. While the terms of the resolution are subject to Court approval at a sentencing hearing, which is currently scheduled for October 7, 2024, the obligations\nof the Company, EGSI, and Envigo RMS under the Resolution Agreement, the Plea Agreement and related documents apply beginning on the date of execution\nof June 3, 2024.\nAs previously disclosed, on May 19, 2022, a civil complaint was filed by DOJ against Envigo RMS in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of\nVirginia alleging violations of the AWA at the Cumberland facility. On July 15, 2022, the court approved a settlement entered into by Envigo RMS, DOJ and\nthe USDA in this civil case, which also comprised USDA’s administrative claims against Envigo RMS for the Cumberland facility, and the civil and\nadministrative complaints were dismissed with prejudice on September 14, 2022. This matter is now fully resolved.\nOn June 15, 2021, EGSI, a subsidiary of the Company acquired in the Envigo acquisition, received a grand jury subpoena requested by the U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) for the production of documents related to the procurement of NHPs from foreign suppliers for the\nperiod January 1, 2018 through June 1, 2021. The subpoena relates to an earlier grand jury subpoena requested by the USAO-SDFL and received by EGSI’s\npredecessor entity, Covance Research Products, in April 2019. Envigo acquired EGSI from Covance, Inc., a subsidiary of Laboratory Corporation of America\nHoldings, in June 2019. As of the filing date of this report, the Company has not received any additional subpoenas related to this matter.\nOn January 27, 2022, EGSI acquired OBRC, which owns and operates a primate quarantine and holding facility located near Alice, Texas. In 2019, OBRC\nreceived grand jury subpoenas requested by the USAO-SDFL requiring the production of documents and information related to its importation of NHPs into\nthe United States. On June 16, 2021, OBRC received a grand jury subpoena requested by the USAO-SDFL requiring the production of documents related to the\nprocurement of NHPs from foreign suppliers for the period January 1, 2018 through June 1, 2021. The OBRC purchase agreement provides for indemnification\nof EGSI and its officers, directors and affiliates by the Seller, Orient Bio, Inc., for liabilities resulting from actions, inactions, errors or omissions of Orient Bio,\nInc. or OBRC related to any period prior to the closing date. As of the filing date of this report, the Company has not received any additional subpoenas related\nto this matter.\nOn November 16, 2022 the Company disclosed that employees of the principal supplier of NHPs to the Company, along with two Cambodian government\nofficials, had been criminally charged by the USAO-SDFL with conspiring to illegally import NHPs into the United States from December 2017 through\nJanuary 2022 and in connection with seven specific imports between July 2018 and December 2021. One of these Cambodian officials was tried in March\n2024 and prevailed on all charges.\nIn connection with the matters described herein, on July 23, 2024, USAO-SDFL informed the Company that it was no longer investigating the Company or its\nsubsidiaries with respect to their procurement of NHPs from foreign suppliers or NHP importation practices.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOn May 23, 2023, Inotiv received a voluntary request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) seeking documents and information for the\nperiod December 1, 2017 to the present regarding the Company, EGSI, and OBRC’s importation of NHPs from Asia, including information relating to whether\ntheir importation practices complied with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In March 2024, the SEC provided the Company a formal order of\ninvestigation concerning this matter that is dated January 9, 2024, and on April 12, 2024, the SEC provided supplemental document requests to the Company.\nThe Company is cooperating with the SEC.\n15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn August 7, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the lenders party thereto entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the\nCredit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment among other changes, waives the financial covenant tests set out under the Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter\nending June 30, 2024, establishes a new weekly liquidity reporting requirement to the lenders, and establishes a new minimum weekly liquidity requirement of\n$7,000 for each of the weeks ending August 16, 2024, August 23, 2024 and August 30, 2024, $17,500 for each of the weeks ending October 11, 2024,\nOctober 18, 2024 and October 25, 2024 and $10,000 for each other week thereafter.\nITEM 2 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Report contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Our actual results could\ndiffer materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included\nelsewhere in this Report.\nAll amounts in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are presented in thousands, unless otherwise\nspecified.\n37\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Overview\nInotiv is a leading contract research organization (\"CRO\") dedicated to providing nonclinical and analytical drug discovery and development services to the\npharmaceutical and medical device industries and selling a range of research-quality animals and diets to the same industries as well as academia and\ngovernment clients. Our products and services focus on bringing new drugs and medical devices through the discovery and preclinical phases of development,\nall while focusing on increasing efficiency, improving data and reducing the cost of discovering and taking new drugs and medical devices to market. Inotiv is\ncommitted to supporting discovery and development objectives as well as helping researchers realize the full potential of their critical research and\ndevelopment projects, all while working together to build a healthier and safer world. We are dedicated to practicing high standards of laboratory animal care\nand welfare.\nOver the past five years, we have undertaken significant internal and external growth initiatives, integration of our acquisitions, as well as site optimization\ninitiatives. Our growth initiatives include acquisitions and related integrations, expansion of existing capacity and services, and startup of new services. Prior to\nfiscal year 2022, our growth initiatives focused on discovery and safety assessment services, and, as a result of our strategic acquisition of Envigo RMS\nHolding Corp. in November 2021, which added a complementary research model platform, our full spectrum solutions span two segments: Discovery and\nSafety Assessment (“DSA”) and Research Models and Services (“RMS”). In addition to the growth initiatives described above, we have also undertaken site\noptimization initiatives through site closures and consolidation in the U.S. and Europe as further described below.\nDSA\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our focus for the DSA segment revolved around maximizing the integration of service offerings from previous\nacquisitions and continuing to build out additional service capabilities and capacity. As we completed fitting out laboratory space, validating new equipment\nand establishing our processes over the last year, we added to the overall depth and breadth of our services portfolio, and expanded our client service\ncapabilities, which are designed to enhance both overall quality and operating margins by reducing our reliance on third-party outsourcing. Furthermore, the\nexpansion activities at Fort Collins, Colorado, were completed by the end of October 2023 and the expanded site completed the validation of our facility and\nequipment in January 2024.\nRMS\nDuring the nine months ended June 30, 2024, our focus for our business within the RMS segment included navigating the global non-human primate (\"NHP\")\nmarket and executing on our continued site optimization plans and new strategies to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the production and\ntransportation of our products. We closed on the sale of our Blackthorn, U.K., Dublin, Virginia, Haslett, Michigan and Cumberland, Virginia facilities during\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2024. We closed on the sale of our Blackthorn site during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and we are leasing the facility back.\nThe consolidation of the operations at our Blackthorn, U.K., facility with the operations in Hillcrest, U.K., is complete as of the date of this report and we\nexpect to exit the leased facility before the end of the fourth quarter fiscal 2024.\nIn December 2023, the Company announced that it would be partnering with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC, the Company’s then-current provider of\ntransportation services, to enable the in-house integration of Inotiv’s North American transportation operations. The Company completed this in-house\nintegration in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company worked on route optimization projects, which were\ndesigned for further efficiencies and cost reductions and is continuing to work on route optimization projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nRefer to Note 10 – Restructuring and Assets Held for Sale in our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 for more information\nrelated to the site optimizations.\nResolution and Plea Agreements\nOn June 3, 2024, Inotiv, Inc. announced that it had reached agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to resolve a previously-announced criminal\ninvestigation into its shuttered canine breeding facility located in Cumberland, Virginia, which was operated originally by Envigo RMS, LLC (“Envigo RMS”),\nan entity acquired by the Company in November 2021. In connection with such resolution, the Company and its related entities have entered into a Resolution\nAgreement (the “Resolution Agreement”) with the DOJ and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia (“USAO-WDV”), and\nEnvigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, Inc. (“EGSI” and together with Envigo RMS, “Envigo”) have entered into a Plea Agreement (the “Plea Agreement”)\nwith the DOJ and the USAO-WDV. On June 3, 2024, before the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to\none\n38\nTable of Contents\nmisdemeanor count of conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act and EGSI pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to violate the Clean Water Act.\nWhile the terms of the resolution are subject to Court approval at a sentencing hearing, which is currently scheduled for October 7, 2024, the obligations of the\nCompany and Envigo under the Resolution Agreement, the Plea Agreement and related documents apply beginning on the date of execution of June 3, 2024.\nRefer to Note 14 – Contingencies for additional information.\nPursuant to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement, the Company and Envigo, among other matters, have agreed to: (i) make payments totaling\n$22,000 in fines, with $5,000 payable on each of June 3, 2025, 2026 and 2027, and $7,000 (plus accrued interest beginning on the sentencing date) payable on\nJune 3, 2028; (ii) on June 3, 2024, pay $3,000, split between the Virginia Animal Fighting Taskforce and the Humane Society of the United States in\nrecognition of assistance provided to the U.S. Government’s investigation; (iii) on June 3, 2024, pay $3,500 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to\nfund environmental projects, studies, and initiatives in Cumberland County, Virginia; (iv) expend at least $7,000 ($2,500 by June 3, 2025, $2,500 by June 3,\n2026, and $2,000 by June 3, 2027) for improvements to its facilities and personnel related to the welfare of animals; (v) provide a lien to the United States\nagainst sufficient Company assets to secure the deferred payments in connection with the $22,000 fine, which lien will be junior to only the lien provided by\nthe Company to lenders under its credit facility as of April 1, 2024 and additional liens to secure up to $100,000 of additional debt; (vi) meet specified\nstandards with respect to the health, safety and well-being of animals under the Company’s care; (vii) develop, adopt, implement, fund and comply with a\ncomprehensive nationwide compliance plan related to applicable laws; and (viii) the appointment of a Compliance Monitor to review the Company’s care of\nanimals and compliance with certain laws, and to pay all associated costs, which Compliance Monitor shall serve for a term that expires five years after the\ncompletion of the selection process for the Compliance Monitor, unless Envigo is released from probation prior to completion of the five-year term, in which\ncase the monitorship term shall expire three years after the completion of the selection process, or two months after the completion of probation, whichever is\nlater. In addition, the pleas result in Envigo RMS and EGSI being subject to probation for up to five years, with the potential to end the term early at a\nminimum of three years if the Company complies with the elements of the resolution.\nFor the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company has expensed $28,500 related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements, which is presented within other\noperating expense in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In line with the Resolution and Plea Agreements, the Company paid\n$6,500 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and expects to pay an additional $22,000 over multiple years. Accordingly, the Company has included\n$5,000 in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and within “Changes in operating\nassets and liabilities – accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended June\n30, 2024 and the Company has included $17,000 in other long-term liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2024 and “Changes\nin operating assets and liabilities – other assets and liabilities” in its Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the nine months ended June 30,\n2024. The total $28,500 charge is reflected in the operating loss of the RMS segment. The charge of $28,500 is non-deductible for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes. Further, the Fifth Amendment (as defined in Note 6 - Debt), among other changes to the Credit Agreement, permits charges or expenses attributable\nto or related to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement to be added back to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA in an amount up to $28,500 for\npurposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. The Company expects to have additional cash outlays in connection with certain costs related\nto the Resolution Agreement, which would be paid over the next three to five years. The additional cash outlays could include ongoing monitoring and\ncompliance costs, legal expenses and other payments required to comply with the Resolution Agreement, subject to final approvals, and at this time, the\nCompany expects that such costs would be expensed as incurred.\nOperational Update\nOn November 16, 2022, the Company became aware that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL”) had criminally\ncharged employees of the principal supplier of non-human primates (\"NHPs\") to the Company, along with two Cambodian government officials, with\nconspiring to illegally import NHPs into the U.S. from December 2017 through January 2022 and in connection with seven specific imports between July 2018\nand December 2021 (the \"November 16, 2022 event\"). The Company has not been directed to refrain from selling the Cambodian NHPs in its possession in the\nU.S. However, due to the allegations contained in the indictment involving the supplier and the Cambodian government officials, the Company believed that it\nwas prudent, at the time, to refrain from selling or delivering any of its Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. until the Company’s staff and external experts could\nevaluate what additionally could be done to satisfy itself that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia can be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred.\nHistorically, the Company relied on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild\n39\nTable of Contents\nFauna and Flora (“CITES”) documentation and related processes and procedures, including release of each import by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. After a\nthorough review of the documentation we have for the Cambodian NHPs in our inventory and their colonies, we resumed shipping Cambodian NHPs. In\naddition, we completed audits on site at our Cambodian supplier and we worked to establish even more robust procedures for future imports. Inotiv has\ncontinued to monitor and respond to the evolving environment around non-human primates. Although Cambodia has remained closed as a source through the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024, we have identified and extensively audited multiple additional sources of purpose-bred animals that can be made available for life-\nsaving medical research. This has allowed us to diversify our sourcing of NHPs outside of Cambodia to satisfy demand at our DSA business segment and to\nour RMS clients. In addition, we have developed, and sourced, novel genetic testing techniques to further bolster our auditing capabilities to determine whether\nthe animals we import are purpose-bred, and we are assessing the ability to introduce these techniques into our supply chain.\nNHPs are critical for scientific research and are required by international regulatory guidance to develop and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a range of\nlife-saving drugs and treatments prior to their assessment in human clinical trials. Without a consistent source of NHP’s in the U.S., Drug discovery and\ndevelopment in the U.S. could be materially impacted.\nNHP imports into the U.S. for drug discovery significantly declined from 2022 to 2023. The decrease in overall NHP supply drove an increase in pricing in\n2023. Furthermore, we now believe the decreased U.S. NHP supply caused some studies to be shifted outside of the U.S. We also believe some clients\nincreased their inventory levels of NHP’s during 2023 and therefore recently, clients appear to be utilizing existing NHP inventory without purchasing\nhistorical levels of NHPs. RMS revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due\nprimarily to lower NHP-related product and service revenue of $45,667. For the 2024 period, the reduction in sales volumes adversely affected our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2022 and 2023 there were decreases in biotech funding which contributed to a reduced demand for preclinical studies. While U.S. biotech funding\nincreased in the first half of calendar 2024, the Company has yet to see a meaningful increase in demand from biotech clients.\nFinancial Highlights During Three Months Ended June 30, 2024\n• Revenue was $105,786 during the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to $157,468 during the three months ended June 30, 2023, driven\nby a $49,143, or 44.4%, decrease in RMS revenue and a $2,539, or 5.4%, decrease in DSA revenue.\n• Consolidated net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $26,087, or 24.7% of total revenue, compared to consolidated net income for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023 of $365, or 0.2% of total revenue.

The Sixth Amendment among other changes, waives the financial covenant tests set out under the Credit Agreement for the\nfiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, establishes a new weekly liquidity reporting requirement to the lenders, and establishes a new minimum weekly\nliquidity requirement of $7,000 for each of the weeks ending August 16, 2024, August 23, 2024 and August 30, 2024, $17,500 for each of the weeks\nending October 11, 2024, October 18, 2024 and October 25, 2024 and $10,000 on each other week thereafter.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2023\nDSA\n(in thousands, except percentages) Three Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenue $ 44,219 $ 46,758 $ (2,539) (5.4)%\nCost of revenue1 32,597 27,935 4,662 16.7 %\nOperating expenses2 4,809 10,406 (5,597) (53.8)%\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets 4,488 4,235 253 6.0 %\nOperating income3 $ 2,325 $ 4,182 $ (1,857) (44.4)%\nOperating income % of total revenue 2.2 % 2.7 %\n1Cost of revenue includes cost of services provided and cost of products sold and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n2Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n3Table may not foot due to rounding\nDSA revenue decreased by $2,539 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in DSA revenue\nwas primarily driven by a $1,766 decrease in safety assessment service revenue, which includes decreased revenue from general toxicology services due to a\nchange in the mix of studies conducted, a decrease in DSA products revenue and a decrease in discovery services revenue, partially offset by increases in\ngenetic toxicology and biotherapeutic analysis revenue in connection with new business at our Rockville facility of $1,124.\nDSA operating income decreased by $1,857 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to the\ndecrease in revenue. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily due to additional commercial activity at our Rockville facility, increased compensation and\nbenefits expense and increased cost of research models. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to decreases in startup costs and decreases in\ncompensation and benefits expense.\n41\nTable of Contents\nRMS\n(in thousands, except percentages) Three Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenue $ 61,567 $ 110,710 $ (49,143) (44.4)%\nCost of revenue1 52,108 70,140 (18,032) (25.7)%\nOperating expenses2 7,505 9,055 (1,550) (17.1)%\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets 9,401 9,629 (228) (2.4)%\nOperating (loss) income3 $ (7,447) $ 21,886 $ (29,333) (134.0)%\nOperating (loss) income % of total revenue (7.0)% 13.9 %\n1Cost of revenue includes cost of services provided and cost of products sold and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n2Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n3Table may not foot due to rounding\nRMS revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due primarily to the lower NHP-\nrelated product and service revenue of $45,667. Additionally, in the three months ended June 30, 2024, there was a decrease of $2,956 in RMS revenue as a\nresult of the sale of our Israeli businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nRMS operating loss decreased $29,333 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due primarily to decreased\nrevenue, partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenue and a decrease in operating expenses. The $18,032 decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to\nlower NHP-related cost of revenue of $17,298 and the impact of the sale of our Israeli businesses of $2,148. The $1,550 decrease in operating expenses was\nprimarily related to the $1,096 decrease in provision for expected credit losses in addition to decreases in severance, remediation costs and legal and third party\nfees, partially offset by the $2,000 charge related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements.\nUnallocated Corporate\n(in thousands, except percentages) Three Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating expenses1 $ 15,400 $ 17,285 $ (1,885) (10.9)%\nDepreciation 230 — 230 100.0 %\nOperating loss2 $ 15,630 $ 17,285 $ (1,655) (9.6)%\nOperating loss % of total revenue 14.8 % 11.0 %\n1Operating expenses includes general and administrative and other operating expenses\n2Table may not foot due to rounding\nUnallocated corporate costs consist of general and administrative and other operating expenses that are not directly related or allocated to the reportable\nsegments. The decreased operating loss of $1,655 was primarily driven by decreased stock compensation expense, audit expense and compensation and\nbenefits expense, partially offset by increased legal and third party fees.\nOther Expense\nOther expense increased by $1,400 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by an\nincrease of $1,330 in interest expense as a result of increased interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 20.8% and 118.1%, respectively. For the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily driven by a change\n42\nTable of Contents\nin the Company's forecasted loss before income taxes. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was driven by a change in\nthe Company's forecasted loss before income taxes, resulting in a catch up adjustment.\nConsolidated Net Loss\nAs a result of the above described factors, we had a consolidated net loss of $26,087 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to consolidated net\nincome of $365 during the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nNine Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023\nDSA\n(in thousands, except percentages) Nine Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenue $ 135,548 $ 134,874 $ 674 0.5 %\nCost of revenue1 96,210 85,110 11,100 13.0 %\nOperating expenses2 19,307 29,460 (10,153) (34.5)%\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets 13,260 11,826 1,434 12.1 %\nOperating income3 $ 6,771 $ 8,478 $ (1,707) (20.1)%\nOperating income % of total revenue 1.9 % 2.0 %\n1Cost of revenue includes cost of services provided and cost of products sold and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n2Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n3Table may not foot due to rounding\nDSA revenue increased $674 in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in DSA revenue was\nprimarily driven by an increase of $3,683 in safety assessment service revenue, partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to our discovery services of\n$3,045 as a result of the decline in overall biotech funding in the market. The increase in safety assessment service revenue was primarily driven by increased\nrevenue from genetic toxicology services and biotherapeutic analysis in connection with new business at our Rockville facility of $5,209, partially offset by a\ndecrease in medical device surgical services revenue of $2,989.\nDSA operating income decreased by $1,707 in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an\nincrease of $11,100 in cost of revenue and an increase of $1,434 in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of $10,153\nin operating expenses and the revenue increase. The increase in cost of revenue is primarily due to additional commercial activity at our Rockville facility,\nincreases in compensation and benefits expense, increases in supplies expense and increases in rent and utilities expense. The decrease in operating expenses\nprimarily relates to decreases in startup costs, decreases in compensation and benefits expense, decreases in non-income tax expense and decreases in rent and\nutilities expense.\n43\nTable of Contents\nRMS\n(in thousands, except percentages) Nine Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nRevenue $ 224,774 $ 296,811 $ (72,037) (24.3)%\nCost of revenue1 182,880 212,958 (30,078) (14.1)%\nOperating expenses2 46,086 25,856 20,230 78.2 %\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets 28,781 28,291 490 1.7 %\nGoodwill impairment loss3 — 66,367 (66,367) (100.0)%\nOperating (loss) income 4 $ (32,973) $ (36,661) $ 3,688 (10.1)%\nOperating (loss) income % of total revenue (9.2)% (8.5)%\n1Cost of revenue includes cost of services provided and cost of products sold and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n2Operating expenses include selling, general and administrative and other operating expenses and excludes depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, which is separately stated\n3Goodwill impairment loss shown on the condensed consolidated statement of operations only impact the RMS Segment\n4Table may not foot due to rounding\nRMS revenue decreased $72,037 in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 due primarily to the negative\nimpact of lower NHP sales of $58,161. Additionally, there was a decrease of $8,890 in RMS revenue as a result of the sale of our Israeli business in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2023. The remaining decrease in RMS revenue was due primarily to decreases in small animal sales and RMS services in the U.S., partially\noffset by an increase in diets and bedding sales.\nRMS operating loss decreased $3,688 in the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared the nine months ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in the operating\nloss is primarily due to a $66,367 decrease in the goodwill impairment charge related to our RMS segment in the prior year period that did not recur, decreased\nrevenue, decreased cost of revenue and an increase of in operating expenses. The decrease of $30,078 in cost of revenue was primarily due to reduced costs\nassociated with lower NHP-related product and service revenue of $22,462 and the impact of the sale of our Israeli business of $6,208. The $20,230 increase in\noperating expenses was primarily due to the $28,500 charge related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements (as defined in Note 1), partially offset by a decrease\nin legal and professional fees of $3,827, a decrease in provision for expected credit losses of $1,733, and a decrease in remediation costs of $1,114 in addition\nto decreases in property and equipment impairment charges and severance.\nUnallocated Corporate\n(in thousands, except percentages) Nine Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating expenses1 $ 46,554 $ 55,737 $ (9,183) (16.5)%\nDepreciation and amortization of intangible assets 483 — 483 100.0 %\nOperating loss2 $ 47,037 $ 55,737 $ (8,700) (15.6)%\nOperating loss % of total revenue (13.1)% (12.9)%\n1Operating loss includes general and administrative and other operating expenses\n2Table may not foot due to rounding\nUnallocated corporate operating loss consists of general and administrative expenses, other operating expenses and depreciation expense that are not directly\nrelated or allocated to the reportable segments. The decrease in unallocated corporate operating expenses of $9,183 in the nine months ended June 30, 2024,\ncompared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was primarily driven primarily by decreases in legal fees and third party fees, acquisition and integration\ncosts, stock compensation expense and compensation and benefits expense.\n44\nTable of Contents\nOther Expense\nOther expense increased by $380 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by an increase of\n$2,817 in interest expense as a result of increasing interest rates, partially offset by net gains on disposition of property and equipment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were 15.7% and 17.8%, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30,\n2024, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily driven by unfavorable permanent items related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements and valuation\nallowance adjustments. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of non-deductible\ngoodwill impairment and other discrete adjustments.\nConsolidated Net Loss\nAs a result of the above described factors, we had a consolidated net loss of $89,994 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a consolidated\nnet loss of $96,196 during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (\"GAAP\") applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal\ncourse of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and\nclassification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $14,434 and access to a $15,000 revolver, which had no balance\noutstanding as of June 30, 2024 and a $12,000 balance outstanding as of the date of this report. The proceeds from the recent draw on the revolver were used\nfor working capital demands, such as timing of an NHP deposit. The November 16, 2022 event and subsequent decision to refrain from selling or delivering\nCambodian NHPs held in the U.S. triggered a material adverse event clause in our Credit Agreement discussed in Note 6 - Debt to these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements resulting in, among other things, a limitation of our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility. The loss of access to our\nrevolving credit facility at the time and reduced liquidity resulting from the decision to refrain from selling Cambodian NHPs held in the U.S. resulted in\nreduced forecasted liquidity. As a result of these events, the Company took steps to improve its liquidity, which included negotiating an amendment to its\nCredit Agreement in January 2023 to reinstate its ability to borrow under its revolving credit facility. Without the amendment, the Company was at the time at\nrisk of not having the revolving credit facility available.\nIn 2023, we implemented several initiatives to integrate and optimize several of the facilities we acquired through acquisitions in 2021 and 2022. The initiatives\nincluded significant investments in existing facilities and were also designed to enhance animal welfare and customer experience, reduce our operating costs\nand provide additional scale and create efficiencies in our remaining operations. Additionally, we identified and have been implementing new strategies to\nimprove the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the transportation of our products. We announced several site consolidation plans in the U.S. and certain\nEuropean and U.K. sites. Our site optimization plans allow us to reduce overhead and create efficiencies through scale. During fiscal 2023, we completed all\nplanned fiscal year 2023 consolidations and closures and sold our Israeli businesses. The consolidation of the operations at our Blackthorn, U.K., facility with\nthe operations in Hillcrest, U.K., is complete as of the date of this report and we expect to exit the leased facility before the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal\n2024. Over the last year, we have continued to improve our infrastructure and worked to optimize our operating platform to support future growth. These\nimprovements included investments in our information technology platforms, building program management functions to enhance management and\ncommunication with clients and multi-site programs, further enhancing client services and improving the client experience. We believe the actions taken and\ninvestments made in recent periods form a solid foundation upon which we can continue to build. However, there is no assurance that such actions will\nultimately have the intended effects.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the site optimizations noted above and other restructuring initiatives, we reduced our workforce. We also took steps to reduce our budgeted\ncapital expenditures and certain forecasted expenses, including a reduction of nonessential travel and employee-related expenses among other efficiency-based\nreductions. Additionally, we identified and executed new strategies to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the transportation of our products. In\nDecember 2023, we announced that we would be partnering with Vanguard Supply Chain Solutions LLC, a provider of our transportation services, to enable\nthe in-house integration of our North American transportation operations. By taking direct control of our transportation operations, we believe we have\nachieved key efficiencies to strengthen internal operations, improve our outgoing supply chain, and bolster service and scientific continuity for clients. In the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed the in-house integration of our North American transportation operations as described above. During the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the Company worked on route optimization projects, which are designed for further efficiencies and cost reductions and is\ncontinuing to work on route optimization projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThe financial covenants under the Company's Credit Agreement include, among others, a requirement to not permit the consolidated debt to consolidated\nEBITDA of the Company to exceed certain leverage thresholds under the Credit Agreement. On June 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment\nto the Credit Agreement, which provides that any charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements may be added back to\nthe Company’s consolidated EBITDA (up to $28,500) for purposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of the date of filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to the decrease in the Company's revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events) to the Credit Agreement, which waives the testing of the secured\nleverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants thereunder as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the unexpected shift in NHP demand as\ndiscussed in the Operational Update above, there is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in revenue for the remainder of the 2024 fiscal\nyear. If the Company's revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit\nAgreement beginning with the September 30, 2024 test date. If at the time the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K it reports a failure to comply\nwith its financial covenants which remains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, this would constitute an event of default\nunder the Credit Agreement and the lenders may, among other remedies set out under the Credit Agreement, declare all or any portion of the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, if the lenders were to accelerate the\nloans under the Credit Agreement, such acceleration would constitute a default under our indenture governing the Company's Convertible Senior Notes (the\n\"Notes\") which, if not cured within 30 days following notice of such default from the trustee or holders of 25 percent of the Notes, would permit the trustee or\nsuch holders to accelerate the Notes. If the lenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, the Company does not believe its existing cash and cash\nequivalents, together with cash generated from operations, would be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned\ntargeted capital expenditures, and repay the entirety of its outstanding senior term loans, repay the entirety of its outstanding Notes and repay the entirety of the\n$12,000 balance of the revolving credit facility in the next twelve months. Additionally, access to the revolver would be restricted and such funds would not be\navailable to pay for any operating activities.\nOur evaluation of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles entailed analyzing\nprospective fully implemented operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of our cash needs and comparing those needs to the current cash and cash\nequivalent balances in order to satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and to comply with minimum\nliquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve\nmonths. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented\nand are outside of its control as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the\nmitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s\nplans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial\nstatements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about\nthe entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. After\nconsidering the factors outlined above, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\nWe plan to continue our efforts to optimize our capital allocation and expense base, which reduced our cash expenses in the three and nine months ended June\n30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, and which are\n46\nTable of Contents\nexpected to continue to reduce cash expenses in the remainder of fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. Further, we have invested and plan to continue to invest in\nour DSA capacity and added to our service offerings in recent periods which we plan to utilize in order to support future revenue growth and margins. The\nCompany also continues to collaborate with its lenders with regard to its current business conditions. The Company plans to request amendments to the Credit\nAgreement, which may include potential additional financial covenant requirements, in an effort to avoid an acceleration of the loans under the Credit\nAgreement prior to their existing maturity. In the event that the Company fails to comply with the requirements of the financial covenants set forth in the Credit\nAgreement, the Company has approximately 55 days subsequent to any fiscal quarter, and approximately 100 days subsequent to fiscal year-end to cure\nnoncompliance (the \"grace period\"). Additionally, the Company has and may continue to seek additional financing and evaluate financing alternatives to meet\nits cash requirements for the next 12 months. There is no assurance that the Company’s lenders will agree to any amendment to the Credit Agreement, nor can\nthere be any assurance that the Company would be able to raise additional capital, whether through selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining a\nline of credit or other loan on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.\nComparative Cash Flow Analysis\nAt June 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $14,434, compared to $35,492 at September 30, 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4,433 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $9,120 for\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nNet cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended June 30, 2024, was driven by non-cash charges of $36,370 and a net increase in operating assets\nand liabilities of $49,191, partially offset by a net loss of $89,994.

Refer to the statements of cash flows\nfor information related to payments on the revolving credit facility during the nine months ended June 30, 2023.\nSignificant Transactions\nOn October 12, 2022, the Company drew its $35,000 delayed draw term loan (the “Additional DDTL”) allowed under the First Amendment to the Credit\nAgreement (“First Amendment”). A portion of the proceeds was used to repay the $15,000 balance on the Company’s revolving credit facility, while the\nremaining amount was drawn to fund a portion of the Company’s capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 and those planned for fiscal year 2023.\nOn December 29, 2022 and January 9, 2023, the Company, the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), entered\ninto the Second and Third Amendments, respectively, to the Credit Agreement. Refer below for further information related to those amendments.\n48\nTable of Contents\nOn May 14, 2024 and June 2, 2024, the Company, the lenders party thereto, and Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), entered into the\nFourth and Fifth Amendments, respectively, to the Credit Agreement. Refer below for further information related to those amendments.\nTerm Loan Facility, DDTL and Incremental Term Loans\nBelow are the weighted-average effective interest rates for the loans available under the Credit Agreement (as defined below):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nJune 30, June 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nEffective interest rates:\nTerm Loan 11.67 % 10.25 % 11.43 % 10.29 %\nInitial DDTL 11.66 % 10.22 % 11.41 % 10.31 %\nAdditional DDTL 11.78 % 10.35 % 11.54 % 10.47 %\nCredit Agreement\nOn November 5, 2021, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”), the lenders party thereto, and the Agent, entered into\na Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") in the original principal amount of\n$165,000, a delayed draw term loan facility in the original principal amount of $35,000 (available to be drawn up to 18 months from the date of the Credit\nAgreement) (the “Initial DDTL” and together with the Additional DDTL, the “DDTL,\"), and a revolving credit facility in the original principal amount of\n$15,000. On November 5, 2021, the Company borrowed the full amount of the term loan facility, but did not borrow any amounts on the delayed draw term\nloan facility or the revolving credit facility.\nThe Company could have elected to borrow on each of the loan facilities at either an adjusted LIBOR rate of interest or an adjusted prime rate of interest.\nAdjusted LIBOR rate loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin of between 6.00% and 6.50%, depending on the\nCompany’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The LIBOR rate had to be a minimum of 1.00%. The initial adjusted\nLIBOR rate of interest was the LIBOR rate plus 6.25%. Adjusted prime rate loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate plus a margin of\nbetween 5.00% and 5.50%, depending on the Company’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio. The initial adjusted prime rate of interest was the prime rate\nplus 5.25%.\nThe Company must pay (i) a fee based on a percentage per annum equal to 0.50% on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the\nrevolving credit facility and (ii) a fee based on a percentage per annum equal to 1.00% on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of\nthe delayed draw loan facility. In each case, such fee shall be paid quarterly in arrears.\nEach of the term loan facility and delayed draw term loan facility require annual principal payments in an amount equal to 1.00% of their respective original\nprincipal amounts. The Company shall also repay the term loan facility on an annual basis in an amount equal to a percentage of its Excess Cash Flow (as\ndefined in the Credit Agreement), which percentage will be determined by its then current Secured Leverage Ratio. Each of the loan facilities may be repaid at\nany time. Voluntary prepayments were subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium if made on or prior to November 5, 2023 and other breakage penalties, as\ndefined in the Credit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments made after November 5, 2023 are not subject to any prepayment premium.\nThe Company is required to maintain a Secured Leverage Ratio of not more than 4.25 to 1.00 for the Company's fiscal quarters through the fiscal quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023, 3.75 to 1.00 beginning with the Company’s fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2023, and 3.00 to 1.00 beginning with the Company’s fiscal\nquarter ending March 31, 2025. The Company is required to maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which\nratio was 1.00 to 1.00 during the first year of the Credit Agreement and is 1.10 to 1.00 from and after the Credit Agreement’s first anniversary.\nEach of the loan facilities is secured by all assets (other than certain excluded assets) of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. Repayment of\neach of the loan facilities is guaranteed by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOn January 7, 2022, the Company drew $35,000 on the Initial DDTL. Amounts outstanding under the Initial DDTL accrued interest at an annual rate equal to\nthe LIBOR rate plus a margin of between 6.00% and 6.50%, depending on the Company’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement). The initial adjusted LIBOR rate of interest was the LIBOR rate plus 6.25%.\nThe Term Loan and the Initial DDTL will mature on November 5, 2026.\nFirst Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn January 27, 2022, the Company, Subsidiary Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and the Agent entered into the First Amendment to the existing Credit\nAgreement. The First Amendment provides for, among other things, an increase to the existing term loan facility in the amount of $40,000 (the “Incremental\nTerm Loans”) and the Additional DDTL in the original principal amount of $35,000, which amount is available to be drawn up to 24 months from the date of\nthe First Amendment. The Incremental Term Loans and any amounts borrowed under the Additional DDTL are referred to herein as the “Additional Term\nLoans”. On January 27, 2022, the Company borrowed the full amount of the Incremental Term Loans, and on October 12, 2022, the Company borrowed the\nfull $35,000 under the Additional DDTL.\nAmounts outstanding under the Additional Term Loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the LIBOR rate plus a margin of between 6.00% and 6.50%,\ndepending on the Company’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The initial adjusted LIBOR rate of interest was the\nLIBOR rate plus 6.25%.\nThe Additional Term Loans require annual principal payments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount. Voluntary prepayments of the\nAdditional Term Loans were subject to a 1.00% prepayment premium if made on or prior to November 5, 2023 and other breakage penalties, as defined in the\nCredit Agreement. Voluntary prepayments made after November 5, 2023 are not subject to any prepayment premium.\nThe Company shall also repay the term loans on an annual basis in an amount equal to a percentage of its Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement), which percentage will be determined by its then current Secured Leverage Ratio.\nThe Additional Term Loans are secured by all assets (other than certain excluded assets) of the Company and each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. Repayment of\nthe Additional Term Loans is guaranteed by each of the Subsidiary Guarantors.\nThe Additional Term Loans will mature on November 5, 2026.\nSecond Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn December 29, 2022, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and the Agent, entered into a Second Amendment (the “Second\nAmendment”) to the Credit Agreement.\nThe Second Amendment provided for, among other things, an extension of the deadline for the Company to provide to the lenders the audited financial\nstatements for the Company’s fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and an annual budget for 2023; the Company satisfied these requirements by the extended\ndeadline. The Second Amendment added a requirement that the Company provide, within 30 days after the end of each month, an unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement of cash flows as of the end of, and for, such month, as well as a “key performance indicator”\nreport. The Second Amendment also requires that, within 10 business days after the end of each month, the Company will provide a rolling 13-week cash flow\nforecast prepared on a monthly basis. The Second Amendment further provides that, upon the request of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement), the Company will permit a financial advisor designated by the Required Lenders to meet with management of the Company to discuss the affairs,\nfinances, accounts and condition of the Company during the six-month period following the effective date of the Second Amendment. In addition, the Second\nAmendment requires the Company to deliver an updated organization chart and certain supplemental information regarding the Company’s subsidiaries in\nconnection with each quarterly report required pursuant to the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Second Amendment, the Company could have elected to borrow on each of the loan facilities at either an adjusted term secured overnight financing\nrate (“Term SOFR”) rate of interest or an alternate base rate of interest. Term SOFR loans accrued interest at an annual rate equal to the applicable Term SOFR\nrate plus (i) an adjustment percentage equal to between 0.11448% and 0.42826%, depending on the term of the loan (“Adjusted Term SOFR”); provided that,\n50\nTable of Contents\nAdjusted Term SOFR could never be less than 1.00%, and (ii) a margin of between 6.00% and 6.50%, depending on the Company’s then current Secured\nLeverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Alternate base rate loans could accrue interest at an annual rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal\nFunds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus 0.50%, (b) the Agent’s prime rate and (c) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor plus\n1.00% (the “Second Amendment Alternate Base Rate”); provided that, the Second Amendment Alternate Base Rate could never be less than 2.00%, plus (ii) a\nmargin of between 5.00% and 5.50%, depending on the Company’s then current Secured Leverage Ratio.\nThe Second Amendment also provides that the Company may not request any credit extensions under the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement,\nif any of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement cannot be satisfied, including, without limitation, the making of the\nrepresentation and warranty that as of the date of the most recent audited financial statements delivered to the Agent, no event, change, circumstance, condition,\ndevelopment or occurrence has had, or would reasonably be expected to result in, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined\nin the Credit Agreement).\nIn addition, the Second Amendment provided that, no later than January 13, 2023 (or such later date as the Required Lenders shall agree in their discretion), the\nCompany shall (i) appoint a financial advisor on terms reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders and the Company for a term of at least six months, (ii)\nprovide a 13-week budget to the Agent, and (iii) deliver a perfection certificate supplement updating certain information previously provided with respect to\neach of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including information regarding certain collateral and other assets owned by such parties. The Company\ntimely satisfied each of these requirements.\nThird Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn January 9, 2023, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the lenders party thereto, and the Agent, entered into a Third Amendment (“Third Amendment”)\nto the Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment provides that, among other things, during the period beginning on January 9, 2023 and, subject to the terms of\nthe Credit Agreement, ending on the date on which financial statements for the Company’s fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2024 are delivered or are required\nto be delivered, as long as no event of default has occurred (the “Amendment Relief Period”):\n• the Cambodian NHP-related matters, to the extent existing and disclosed to the lenders prior to December 29, 2022, shall not constitute a Material\nAdverse Effect under the Credit Agreement and will not restrict the Company’s ability to request credit extensions under the revolving credit facility;\n• the use of borrowings under the revolving credit facility is limited to funding operational expenses of the Company in the ordinary course and cannot\nbe used for the making or funding of investments, permitted acquisitions or restricted payments, payments or purchases with respect to any\nindebtedness, bonuses or executive compensation, or judgments, fines or settlements; and\n• additional limitations are imposed on the Company under the Credit Agreement, including restrictions on permitted asset sales, a prohibition on\nmaking permitted acquisitions, and significant limitations on the ability to incur additional debt, make investments and make restricted payments.\nThe Third Amendment provides that from and after the date thereof, no incremental facilities under the Credit Agreement may be established or incurred. The\nThird Amendment also provides for additional mandatory prepayments of borrowed amounts following the receipt by the Company of certain cash receipts,\nincluding proceeds from certain equity issuances and cash received by the Company not in the ordinary course of business. Under the Third Amendment, after\nany draw on the revolving credit facility, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held on hand domestically within the U.S. cannot exceed $10,000.\nUnder the Third Amendment, the Company may elect to borrow on each of the loan facilities accruing interest at either an adjusted Term SOFR or an alternate\nbase rate of interest. Term SOFR loans shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the applicable Term SOFR rate plus (i) an adjustment percentage equal to\nbetween 0.11448% and 0.42826%, depending on the term of the loan, provided that, the Adjusted Term SOFR shall never be less than 1.00% per annum, plus\n(ii) an applicable margin of 6.75% per annum for term loans maintained as SOFR loans or 9.50% per annum for revolving loans maintained as SOFR loans.\nAlternate base rate loans shall accrue interest at an annual rate equal to (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) plus 0.50%, (b) the Agent’s prime rate and (c) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor plus 1.00% (the “Alternate Base Rate”), provided that,\nthe Alternate Base Rate is\n51\nTable of Contents\nsubject to a floor of 2.00% per annum plus (ii) an applicable margin of 5.75% per annum for term loans maintained as Alternate Base Rate loans or 8.50% per\nannum for revolving loans maintained as Alternate Base Rate loans.\nThe fee consideration payable by the Company for each consenting lender party to the Third Amendment is: (i) 0.50% of the aggregate outstanding principal\namount of the term loans held by each consenting term loan lender, to be paid in-kind and capitalized to the principal amounts of the term loans held by such\nlender; (ii) 0.50% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loans held by each consenting term loan lender, to be paid in cash upon the\noccurrence of certain prepayments of the term loan under the Credit Agreement; and (iii) 7.00% of the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments held by\neach consenting revolving lender, to be paid in cash upon the occurrence with certain permanent reductions of the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement.\nFourth Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn May 14, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the lenders party thereto entered into a Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the\nCredit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment provides that any charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements may be\nadded back to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA (up to $26,500) for purposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nThe fee consideration payable by the Company for each consenting lender party to the Fourth Amendment is 0.50% of the aggregate outstanding principal\namount of the term loans held by each consenting term loan lender, to be paid in-kind and capitalized to the principal amounts of the term loans held by such\nlender.\nFifth Amendment to Credit Agreement\nOn June 2, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the lenders party thereto entered into a Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Credit\nAgreement. The Fifth Amendment, among other changes, permits charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution Agreement and the Plea\nAgreement to be added back to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA in an amount up to $28,500; excludes any direct effects to the Company resulting from\nthe Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement from being deemed a material adverse effect under the Credit Agreement; permits liens on the Company and\ncertain subsidiaries in favor of the DOJ in connection with the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement; provides that certain uncured or unwaived\nbreaches of the terms and conditions of the Resolution Agreement and the Plea Agreement shall be considered an event of default under the Credit Agreement;\nand enables the lenders to cause, at their discretion, material foreign subsidiaries to be joined as guarantors of the Company’s obligations under the Credit\nAgreement.\nThe fee consideration payable by the Company for each consenting lender party to the Fifth Amendment is 0.50% of the aggregate outstanding principal\namount of the term loans held by each consenting term loan lender, to be paid in-kind and capitalized to the principal amounts of the term loans held by such\nlender.\nAcquisition-related Debt (Seller Notes)\nIn addition to the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have issued unsecured notes as partial payment of the\npurchase prices of certain acquisitions as described herein. Each of these notes is subordinated to the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.\nAs part of the acquisition of Pre-Clinical Research Services, Inc. (\"PCRS\"), the Company issued an unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to the\nPCRS seller in the initial principal amount of $800. The promissory note bears interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum with monthly payments of principal and\ninterest and a maturity date of December 1, 2024.\nAs part of the acquisition of Bolder BioPATH, the Company issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes payable to the former shareholders of Bolder\nBioPATH in an aggregate principal amount of $1,500. As part of the working capital adjustment in March 2022, a reduction of the promissory note of $470 was\nrecorded. The promissory notes bear interest at a rate of 4.50% per annum, with monthly payments of principal and interest and a maturity date of May 1, 2026.\nAs part of the acquisition of Plato BioPharma, Inc. (\"Plato\"), the Company issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes payable to the former shareholders\nof Plato in an aggregate principal amount of $3,000. The promissory notes bore interest\n52\nTable of Contents\nat a rate of 4.50% per annum, with monthly payments of principal and interest and a maturity date of June 1, 2023. The promissory notes were paid in full as of\nJune 1, 2023.\nAs part of the acquisition of Orient BioResource Center, Inc. (\"OBRC\"), the Company agreed to leave in place a payable owed by OBRC to Orient Bio, Inc.\n(the \"Seller\") in the amount of $3,700, which the Company determined to have a fair value of $3,325 as of January 27, 2022. The payable does not bear interest\nand was originally required to be paid to the Seller 18 months after the closing date of January 27, 2022. The Company has the right to set off against the\npayable any amounts that become payable by the Seller on account of indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement. On April 4, 2023, the\nCompany and the Seller entered into a First Amendment to extend the maturity date of the payable to July 27, 2024. On May 24, 2024, the Company and the\nSeller entered into a Second Amendment to extend the maturity date of the payable to July 27, 2025. Further, beginning on July 27, 2024, the note bears\ninterest at a rate of 4.60% per annum. Accrued interest and principal will be paid at the maturity date. Neither the first nor the second amendment to the payable\naffected the rights and remedies of any party under the stock purchase agreement, nor alter, modify or amend or in any way affect any of the terms and\nconditions, obligations, covenants or agreements contained in the stock purchase agreement.\nAs part of the acquisition of Histion, the Company issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes payable to the former shareholders of Histion in an\naggregate principal amount of $433.

These notes were paid in full on January 7, 2024.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn September 27, 2021, the Company issued $140,000 principal amount of its 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued\npursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of September 27, 2021, among the Company, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, BAS\nEvansville, Inc., as guarantor (the “Guarantor”), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”). Pursuant to the purchase agreement between\nthe Company and the initial purchaser of the Notes, the Company granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days\nfrom, and including, the date the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $15,000 principal amount of the Notes. The Notes issued on September 27, 2021\nincluded $15,000 principal amount of the Notes issued pursuant to the full exercise by the initial purchaser of such option. The Company used the net proceeds\nfrom the offering of the Notes, together with borrowings under a new senior secured term loan facility, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the\nEnvigo acquisition and related fees and expenses.\nThe Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured\nindebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively\nsubordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv)\nstructurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder\nthereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s non-guarantor subsidiaries. The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis,\nby the Guarantor.\nThe Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2022.\nThe Notes will mature on October 15, 2027, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before April 15, 2027, noteholders have the right to convert\ntheir Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after April 15, 2027, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the\nclose of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as\napplicable, cash, its common shares or a combination of cash and its common shares, at the Company’s election. The initial conversion rate is 21.7162 common\nshares per $1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $46.05 per common share. The conversion rate and\nconversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a “Make-\nWhole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of\ntime.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAs of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, there were $3,468 and $4,172, respectively, in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Notes. For the three\nmonths ended June 30, 2024, the total interest expense was $2,948, including coupon interest expense of $1,131 accretion expense of $1,580, and the\namortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $237. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the total interest expense was $2,726, including\ncoupon interest expense of $1,071, accretion expense of $1,436, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $219. For the nine months ended\nJune 30, 2024, the total interest expense was $8,755, including coupon interest expense of $3,406, accretion expense of $4,645, and the amortization of debt\ndiscount and issuance costs of $704. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the total interest expense was $8,229, including coupon interest expense of\n$3,371, accretion expense of $4,200, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $658.\nThe Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at the Company’s option at any time on or after October 15, 2024 and on or before the 40th scheduled\ntrading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per common share of the Company exceeds 130.00% of the conversion\nprice on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day\nimmediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such\nnotice. The redemption price is a cash amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling the Notes for redemption pursuant to the provisions described in this paragraph will constitute a Make-\nWhole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time.\nIf certain corporate events that constitute a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then noteholders may require the Company to\nrepurchase their Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nexcluding, the Fundamental Change repurchase date. The definition of Fundamental Change includes certain business combination transactions involving the\nCompany and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common shares.\nThe Notes have customary provisions relating to the occurrence of “Events of Default” (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain\npayment defaults on the Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Notes, are subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) the Company’s\nfailure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) the failure by the Company or the Guarantor to comply with certain\ncovenants in the Indenture relating to the ability of the Company or the Guarantor to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer,\nin one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the Guarantor, as applicable, and its subsidiaries, taken as a\nwhole, to another person; (iv) a default by the Company or the Guarantor in its other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Notes if such default\nis not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by the Company, the Guarantor or any of their\nrespective subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $20,000; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against the Company, the\nGuarantor or any of their respective subsidiaries for the payment of at least $20,000, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after\nthe date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and\nreorganization involving the Company, the Guarantor or any of their respective significant subsidiaries; and (viii) the guarantee of the Notes ceases to be in full\nforce and effect (except as permitted by the Indenture) or the Guarantor denies or disaffirms its obligations under its guarantee of the Notes.\nIf an Event of Default involving bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization events with respect to the Company or the Guarantor (and not solely with respect to a\nsignificant subsidiary of the Company or the Guarantor) occurs, then the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then\noutstanding will immediately become due and payable without any further action or notice by any person. If any other Event of Default occurs and is\ncontinuing, then the trustee, by notice to the Company, or noteholders of at least 25.00% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice\nto the Company and the trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due\nand payable immediately. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may elect, at its option, that the sole remedy for an Event of Default relating\nto certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right of the noteholders to receive\nspecial interest on the Notes for up to 180 days at a specified rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% on the principal amount of the Notes.\n54\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3 – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing financing activities. As of June 30, 2024, our\ndebt portfolio was reliant on reference rates. Based on our interest rate exposure at June 30, 2024 and assumed debt levels throughout the next 12 months, a\none-percentage-point increase in interest rates would result in an estimated $2.7 million pre-tax reduction in net earnings over a one-year period.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows.\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reported in U.S. dollars, our foreign subsidiaries typically conduct their operations in their respective\nlocal currency. The principal functional currencies of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are the Euro, British Pound and, in the fiscal year 2023 periods, the\nIsraeli Shekel.\nFluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash\nflows. As the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the value of our non-U.S. revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally\ndecline when reported in U.S. dollars. The impact to net loss as a result of a U.S. dollar strengthening will be partially mitigated by the value of non-U.S.\nexpenses, which will decline when reported in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue, expenses,\nassets, liabilities, and cash flows will generally increase when reported in U.S. dollars.\nA hypothetical 10% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable to our business would change our June 30, 2024 cash balance by approximately\n$0.5 million and our revenue by approximately $5.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024.\nITEM 4 – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are controls and other procedures designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports\nfiled or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our President and Chief\nExecutive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President - Finance (our principal financial officer), or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (\"Management\").\nManagement has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, Management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of\nJune 30, 2024 because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below.\nPreviously Identified Material Weaknesses\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,\nin internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\n55\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2022, Management identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls, which continued to exist as of June 30, 2024:\na) Management did not design and maintain effective controls over information technology general controls (\"ITGCs\") for all applications that are\nrelevant to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements throughout the year ended September 30, 2022, which resulted in ineffective\nbusiness process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all of the\nfinancial statement accounts and disclosures. Specifically, management did not design and maintain: sufficient user access controls to ensure\nappropriate segregation of duties and adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate\nCompany personnel; and program change management controls to ensure that information technology (“IT”) program and data changes affecting\nfinancial information technology applications and underlying accounting records are authorized, tested, and implemented appropriately. As a result,\nbusiness process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that are dependent on the ineffective ITGCs, or that use data produced\nfrom systems impacted by the ineffective ITGCs were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not remediated and therefore remained\nineffective at June 30, 2024; and\nb) Management did not have an adequate process in place to design and test the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in\na timely manner or an adequate process in place to monitor and provide oversight over the completion of its assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As such, we determined that management did not effectively design and implement components of the criteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO framework) to address all relevant risks of\nmaterial misstatement, including elements of the control environment, information and communication, control activities and monitoring activities\ncomponents, relating to: (i) providing sufficient and timely management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process; (ii)\nhiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company’s internal control objectives; and (iii) performing timely monitoring and\noversight to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. As a result, controls relevant to all\nbusiness processes and related controls (including relevant entity level controls) were deemed ineffective at September 30, 2022, and were not\nremediated and therefore remained ineffective at June 30, 2024.\nAs of the date of this Report, Management has updated the design of several of its controls and modified process designs in an effort to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses described above. However, there remain several\ncontrols and processes that Management continues to re-assess, including the design of controls and modifying processes to improve our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Management’s remediation efforts have included but are not limited to: (i) hiring additional accounting personnel, (ii) hiring key IT\npersonnel with appropriate technical and internal control-related skillsets, and (iii) implementing an internal team dedicated to oversight of control and process\ndesign. Management’s ongoing remediation efforts include: (i) improving consistency in ITGCs supported by standard operating procedures to govern the\nauthorization, testing and approval of changes to IT systems supporting all of the Company’s internal control processes, including the implementation of\ncertain applications to achieve these operating procedures, (ii) enhancing design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of\nformal accounting and IT policies and procedures, (iii) designing, implementing, reviewing, analyzing, and properly documenting our review and approval\ncontrols, as it relates to ITGCs, account reconciliations, journal entries and estimates, and (iv) continuing to provide training to personnel related to ensuring\nthe accuracy and completeness of data used in the performance of the internal controls.\nThe material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded,\nthrough testing, that these controls are operating effectively.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nExcept for the changes in connection with our remediation activities as described above, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially\naffected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II\n56\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1 – LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nInformation pertaining to legal proceedings can be found in Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of\nthis report and is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q from time to time are not the only risks we face. New risk\nfactors or risks that we currently deem immaterial emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor to assess the impact\nsuch risk factors might have on our business, financial condition and operating results, or the extent to which any such risk factor or combination of risk factors\nmay impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nExcept as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors associated with our business previously described in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K filed with the SEC on December 12, 2023. The risk factors set forth below update, and should be read together with our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, including those disclosed under the heading “Risk Factors” appearing in Item 1A of Part I of the Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nAll amounts below are presented in thousands, unless otherwise specified.\nRisks Related to our Financial Activities\nWe have identified conditions and events that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have identified certain conditions or events, which are discussed below, that could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of these and as disclosed elsewhere in this report, substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern exists.\nThe financial covenants under the Company's Credit Agreement include, among others, a requirement to not permit the consolidated debt to consolidated\nEBITDA of the Company to exceed certain leverage thresholds under the Credit Agreement. On June 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment\nto the Credit Agreement, which provides that any charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements may be added back to\nthe Company’s consolidated EBITDA (up to $28,500) for purposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of the date of filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to the decrease in the Company's revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events) to the Credit Agreement, which waives the testing of the secured\nleverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants thereunder as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the unexpected shift in NHP demand as\ndiscussed in the Operational Update above, there is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in revenue for the remainder of the 2024 fiscal\nyear. If the Company's revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit\nAgreement beginning with the September 30, 2024 test date. If at the time the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K it reports a failure to comply\nwith its financial covenants which remains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, this would constitute an event of default\nunder the Credit Agreement and the lenders may, among other remedies set out under the Credit Agreement, declare all or any portion of the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, if the lenders were to accelerate the\nloans under the Credit Agreement, such acceleration would constitute a default under our indenture governing the Company's Convertible Senior Notes (the\n\"Notes\") which, if not cured within 30 days following notice of such default from the trustee or holders of 25 percent of the Notes, would permit the trustee or\nsuch holders to accelerate the Notes. If the lenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, the Company does not believe its existing cash and cash\nequivalents, together with cash generated from operations, would be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned\ntargeted capital expenditures, and repay the entirety of its outstanding senior term loans, repay the entirety of its outstanding Notes and repay the entirety of the\n$12,000 balance of the revolving credit facility in the next twelve months. Additionally, access to the revolver would be restricted and such funds would not be\navailable to pay for any operating activities.\nOur evaluation of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles entailed analyzing\nprospective fully implemented operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of\n57\nTable of Contents\nour cash needs and comparing those needs to the current cash and cash equivalent balances in order to satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for\nplanned targeted capital expenditures, and to comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to\nborrowings pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve months. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential\nmitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented and are outside of its control as of the date the financial statements are issued.\nWhen substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our\nability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be\neffectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will\nmitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that\nthese condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. After considering the factors outlined above, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a\ngoing concern exists.\nIn addition, the fact that there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and that the Company is operating under these\nconditions may adversely affect the Company’s stock price, its ability to raise capital, its ability to comply with its Credit Agreement and its normal business\noperations, among other implications.\nWe have experienced periods of losses and financial insecurity.\nThroughout our history we have experienced periods of financial losses and financial hardship. Our current efforts may not result in profitability, or if our\nefforts result in profits, such profits may not continue for any meaningful period of time. In order to finance various acquisitions and expand certain facilities,\nwe have significantly increased our leverage. Sustained losses may result in our inability to service our financial obligations as they come due, including the\nadditional indebtedness we have incurred to support our growth initiatives, or to meaningfully invest in our business.\nThe Company’s RMS segment revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, due\nprimarily to the negative impact of lower NHP-related product and service revenue. For the 2024 period, such reduction in revenue adversely affected our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, during 2022 and 2023 there were decreases in biotech funding which contributed to a reduced demand for preclinical studies. This reduced demand has\nnegatively impacted the Company’s DSA segment revenue.\nFor further information, refer to the Operational Update within Note 1 – Description of Business and Basis of Presentation of the unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1. There is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in sales for the remainder of\nthe 2024 fiscal year. If the Company’s revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business\nfinancial condition and results of operations, and could result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Company’s Credit Agreement, as\ndiscussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.\nWe have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods, which may impair our ability to raise further capital or impact our ability\nto service our debt.\nWe have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods. Our additional indebtedness may impair our ability to raise further capital,\nincluding to expand our business, pursue strategic investments, and take advantage of financing or other opportunities that we believe to be in the best interests\nof the Company and our shareholders.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is\nsubject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the\nfuture sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or\nmore alternatives, such as selling assets, curtailing spend, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly\ndilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Our additional indebtedness may\nalso impact our ability to service our debt and to comply with financial covenants and the other terms of our relevant credit arrangements, in which case our\nlenders might pursue available remedies up to and including terminating our credit arrangements and foreclosing on available collateral.\nWhile we have implemented efforts to curtail spending, there is no assurance that any such efforts will be successful or will have intended effect on our\navailable cash.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOur credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our business and financing activities. Our assets secure our obligations under the credit\nagreement and may be subject to foreclosure.\nWe are party to a Credit Agreement with Jefferies Finance LLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”).\nThe Credit Agreement contains various covenants, restrictions, and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain\nfinancial ratios, including a secured leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, and impose certain limits on our ability to engage in certain activities.\nThe restrictions in the Credit Agreement impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to compete effectively, take advantage of\nnew business opportunities, or take other actions that may be in our, or our shareholders’, best interests. Further, various risks and uncertainties, including those\narising as a result of the USAO-SDFL criminally charging employees of the Company’s principal supplier of NHPs, along with two Cambodian government\nofficials, may impact our ability to comply with our obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by all assets (other than certain excluded assets) of the Company and each of the subsidiary guarantors.\nOur inability to comply with any of the provisions of the Credit Agreement could result in a default under it. If such a default occurs, including because we fail\nto comply with our financial covenants at the time we file or are required to file our fiscal third quarter results on Form 10-Q, and such non-compliance\nremains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with\naccrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, and they would have the right to terminate any commitments to provide further funds. If the\nlenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, we do not believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from\noperations, would be sufficient to fund our operations, satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and repay the\nentirety of our outstanding senior term loans and repay the entirety of the outstanding Notes in the next twelve months. In addition, if we are unable to repay\noutstanding borrowings when due, the lenders also have the right to proceed against the collateral. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOn August 7, 2024, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the lenders party thereto entered into a Sixth Amendment (the “Sixth Amendment”) to the\nCredit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment among other changes, waives the financial covenant tests set out under the Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter\nending June 30, 2024, establishes a new weekly liquidity reporting requirement to the lenders, and establishes a new minimum weekly liquidity requirement of\n$7,000 for each of the weeks ending August 16, 2024, August 23, 2024 and August 30, 2024, $17,500 for each of the weeks ending October 11, 2024,\nOctober 18, 2024 and October 25, 2024 and $10,000 for each other week thereafter.\nOur failure to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nIf there were an event of default under our Credit Agreement, all amounts outstanding under that agreement could be due and payable immediately, which may\nhave an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An event of default may occur should our assets or cash flow be\ninsufficient to fully repay borrowings under our Credit Agreement, whether paid in the ordinary course or accelerated, or if we are unable to maintain\ncompliance with relevant obligations thereunder, including financial and other covenants. Various risks and uncertainties, including those arising as a result of\nthe USAO-SDFL criminally charging employees of the principal supplier of non-human primates to the Company, along with two Cambodian government\nofficials, may impact our ability to comply with our obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nOur inability to comply with any of the provisions of the Credit Agreement could result in a default under it. If such a default occurs, including because we fail\nto comply with our financial covenants at the time we file or are required to file our fiscal third quarter results on Form 10-Q, and such non-compliance\nremains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, the lenders may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with\naccrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, and they would have the right to terminate any commitments to provide further funds. If the\nlenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, we do not believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from\noperations, would be sufficient to fund our operations, satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and repay the\nentirety of our outstanding senior term loans and repay the entirety of the outstanding Notes in the next twelve months. In addition, if we are unable to repay\noutstanding borrowings when due, the lenders also have the right to proceed against the collateral. Further, access to the revolver under the Credit Agreement\nwould be restricted and such funds would not be available to pay for any operating activities. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n59\nTable of Contents\nWe may need additional capital, and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it.\nSuccessful execution of our growth plans will require that we have access to capital. Our expected financing needs are based upon management’s estimates as\nto future revenue and expense. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change based upon, among other factors, our ability to increase revenues\nand manage expenses and the timing and extent of our future capital expenditures and acquisition activity. If our estimates of our financing needs change, we\nmay need additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need a greater amount of capital.\nIn general, additional capital may be raised through the sale of common shares, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, entry into debt facilities or other\nthird-party funding arrangements. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have\nrights senior to those of our common shares. Agreements entered into in connection with such capital raising activities could contain covenants that would\nrestrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot timely raise\nany needed funds, we may be forced to reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term strategic roadmap\nand grow our business.\nThe financial covenants under the Company's Credit Agreement include, among others, a requirement to not permit the consolidated debt to consolidated\nEBITDA of the Company to exceed certain leverage thresholds under the Credit Agreement. On June 2, 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment\nto the Credit Agreement, which provides that any charges or expenses attributable to or related to the Resolution and Plea Agreements may be added back to\nthe Company’s consolidated EBITDA (up to $28,500) for purposes of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of the date of filing the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, due to the decrease in the Company's revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, the\nCompany entered into the Sixth Amendment (as defined in Note 15 - Subsequent Events) to the Credit Agreement, which waives the testing of the secured\nleverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenants thereunder as of June 30, 2024. As a result of the unexpected shift in NHP demand as\ndiscussed in the Operational Update above, there is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in revenue for the remainder of the 2024 fiscal\nyear. If the Company's revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit\nAgreement beginning with the September 30, 2024 test date. If at the time the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K it reports a failure to comply\nwith its financial covenants which remains unremedied for the period of time stipulated under the Credit Agreement, this would constitute an event of default\nunder the Credit Agreement and the lenders may, among other remedies set out under the Credit Agreement, declare all or any portion of the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the borrowings plus accrued and unpaid interest to be immediately due and payable. Furthermore, if the lenders were to accelerate the\nloans under the Credit Agreement, such acceleration would constitute a default under our indenture governing the Company's Convertible Senior Notes (the\n\"Notes\") which, if not cured within 30 days following notice of such default from the trustee or holders of 25 percent of the Notes, would permit the trustee or\nsuch holders to accelerate the Notes. If the lenders accelerate the loans under the Credit Agreement, the Company does not believe its existing cash and cash\nequivalents, together with cash generated from operations, would be sufficient to fund its operations, satisfy its obligations, including cash outflows for planned\ntargeted capital expenditures, and repay the entirety of its outstanding senior term loans, repay the entirety of its outstanding Notes and repay the entirety of the\n$12,000 balance of the revolving credit facility in the next twelve months. Additionally, access to the revolver would be restricted and such funds would not be\navailable to pay for any operating activities.\nOur evaluation of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles entailed analyzing\nprospective fully implemented operating budgets and forecasts for expectations of our cash needs and comparing those needs to the current cash and cash\nequivalent balances in order to satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows for planned targeted capital expenditures, and to comply with minimum\nliquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to its Credit Agreement for at least the next twelve\nmonths. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of management’s plans that have not been fully implemented\nand are outside of its control as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the\nmitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of management’s\nplans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial\nstatements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about\nthe entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are\n60\nTable of Contents\nissued. After considering the factors outlined above, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists.\nRisks Related to NHP Supply and Demand\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows have and may continue to\nbe adversely affected by our dependence on the importation of NHPs from suppliers located outside the U.S., particularly from communist countries\nin Southeast Asia, legal issues related to these suppliers, and any inability to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, including the carrying value of certain of our assets, and cash flows have and may continue to be\nadversely affected by our dependence on NHP suppliers that are located outside the U.S. and difficulties in being able to diversify our suppliers located outside\nthe U.S. China exited the NHP exportation market in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has repeatedly stated that it strategically intends to dominate,\namongst other things, worldwide biomedical research. As such, their demand for NHPs has shifted a previously exported supply to their domestic use. Legal\nmatters affecting the Cambodian supply of NHPs further exacerbated an already constrained NHP supply for U.S. research. The allegations contained in that\nindictment also led us to refrain from selling or delivering any of the Cambodian NHPs we held in the U.S. until we could evaluate what additionally could be\ndone to confirm that the NHPs in inventory from Cambodia could be reasonably determined to be purpose-bred. The decision to refrain from selling or\ndelivering the Cambodian NHPs had a material adverse effect on our liquidity. In order to address the material adverse effect, we entered into an amendment to\nour credit facility.\nWhile we are seeking to diversify our suppliers located outside the U.S., the number of NHP suppliers is limited, and we may not be successful in doing so. If\nwe are unable to obtain NHPs in sufficient quantities of the required species or in a timely manner to meet the needs of our clients, if the price of NHPs that are\navailable increases significantly, or if we are unable to ship the NHPs in our possession to our clients because of governmental restrictions or limitations, our\nbusiness, particularly in our RMS segment, will be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, overall supply constraints with respect to NHPs has led to an extremely dynamic pricing environment for NHPs, which has, and could continue to,\nmake it difficult to predict results, lead to reduced volumes, and require us to adjust operations. Further, during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 to date, the volume\nof NHPs we sold to third parties was significantly lower than in fiscal 2022.\nOur sales of NHPs have decreased significantly in recent periods, which adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations,\nand this trend may continue.\nThe Company’s RMS segment revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, due\nprimarily to the negative impact of lower NHP-related product and service revenue. For the 2024 period, such reduction in revenue adversely affected our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that the Company will experience an increase in sales for the remainder of the\n2024 fiscal year. If the Company’s revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business financial\ncondition and results of operations, and could result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Company’s Credit Agreement, as discussed\nelsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Legal Matters\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings related to various matters, including employment and securities litigation, and may become involved in other legal\nproceedings that arise from time to time in the future. For example, as discussed further in Note 14 - Contingencies to our unaudited interim condensed\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item I, a putative securities class action and derivative securities lawsuits have been filed against the\nCompany and certain officers and directors, alleging, among other things, violations of the Exchange Act related to the Company’s disclosures concerning its\nacquisitions of Envigo and OBRC and their regulatory compliance.\nAny claims against us, whether meritorious or not, can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. In addition, the expense of litigation and the timing of this expense from period to period are difficult to\nestimate and subject to change. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the\nfuture. Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that\n61\nTable of Contents\ncould result from an unfavorable outcome. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations in any particular period.\nWe are subject to inspections, investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which could lead to penalties, including substantial\nfines, warning letters, a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal penalties, and/or license suspension or revocation.\nWe are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, including the FDA, the USDA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. As part of these\ninspections, the regulatory authorities seek to determine whether our facilities, operations and animal research model importation practices comply with\napplicable laws and regulations. Adverse findings as a result of these inspections could lead to enforcement actions, including substantial fines, warning letters\nthat require corrective action (including potential facilities improvement requirements), revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in\ngovernment healthcare programs, criminal prosecution and even the denial of the right to conduct business. For further information, refer to Note 14 -\nContingencies to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1.\nInspections, investigations and/or other actions could result in penalties that could include a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal\npenalties, debarment and/or permit and/or license suspension or revocation. The imposition of any of these penalties or other restrictions on our business could\nadversely affect our business reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs, liabilities and\nobligations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws, regulations, initiatives and permits that govern, among other things: the\nemission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases, in air, land and water; the remediation of soil, surface water and groundwater contamination;\nthe generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials and wastes, including biomedical and radioactive wastes; and health\nand safety. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or permits could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate existing or\npotential contamination, third-party property damage claims, personal injury claims, natural resource damages claims or modification or revocation of\noperating permits and/or licenses, debarment and/or may lead to temporary or permanent business interruptions. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, we\nmay be held strictly, and under certain circumstances jointly and severally, liable for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites which we\ncurrently own or operate, or sites we or our predecessors have owned or operated in the past. Further, we could be held liable at sites where we have sent waste\nfor disposal.\nEnvironmental laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Compliance\nwith the requirements of laws and regulations may increase capital costs and operating expenses or necessitate changes to our production processes.\nWe use, and in the past have used, hazardous materials and generate, and in the past have generated, hazardous wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of\naccidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and incur liabilities\nwhich could exceed our resources. Our costs, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor further information on these and other actions, see Note 14 – Contingencies to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained\nin Part I, Item 1.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results, and requirements to comply with new laws,\nregulations and guidance may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to\nregulatory authorities. For example, if we were to fail to properly monitor compliance with study protocols, the data collected could be disqualified. Under\nsuch circumstances, we may be contractually required to repeat a study at no further cost to the client, but at substantial cost to us. That development would\nharm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. The issuance of a notice from the FDA or the USDA, or other relevant authorities,\nbased on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice, good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements, animal welfare\nlaws and regulations, or other applicable\n62\nTable of Contents\nregulations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance, including fines or sanctions, debarment and/or permit and/or license\nsuspension or revocation. Furthermore, the cost to comply with new federal or state legislature may adversely affect our operating results.\nFor further information on these and other actions, see Note 14 – Contingencies to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained\nin Part I, Item 1.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe rely on a limited number of key clients, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key\nclients may adversely affect our operating results.\nOne client related to the RMS segment accounted for approximately 22.0% and 28.2% of our total revenue during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFive clients of the DSA segment in the aggregate accounted for approximately 5.4% and 7.2% of our total revenue during fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The loss of a significant amount of business from one or more of our major clients would materially and adversely affect our results of operations\nuntil such time, if ever, as we are able to replace the lost business. Significant clients or projects in any one period may not continue to be significant clients or\nprojects in other periods. In any given year, there is a possibility that a single client may account for a significant percentage of our total revenue or that our\nbusiness may depend on one or more large projects. Since we do not have long-term contracts with most of our clients, the importance of a single client may\nvary dramatically from year to year as projects end and new projects begin. To the extent that we are meaningfully dependent on any single client, we are\nindirectly subject to risks related to that client, including if such risks impede the client’s ability to stay in business or otherwise to make timely payments to us.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, no clients accounted for more than 10% of sales. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, one client\naccounted for 16.1% of sales. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, one client accounted for 19.7% and 22.5% of sales, respectively. During\nthe three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, no vendors accounted for more than 10% of the sum of cost of services and cost of products.\nRisks Related to the Industries we Serve\nWe are substantially dependent on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nOur revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development, including their decisions\nto outsource drug development services to providers like us, rather than handling such services in-house. In some instances, companies in these industries are\nreliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects and to compensate us for services rendered.\nFluctuations in the research and development budgets of researchers and their organizations has, had and could continue to have a significant effect on the\ndemand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and\nbiotechnology companies, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies, among other reasons. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that\naffect our clients in these industries also affect our business. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business depends in large part upon the ability and\nwillingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to purchase the products and outsource\nthe services we provide. If companies in these industries were to reduce the number or scope of research and development projects they conduct or outsource,\nour business could be materially adversely affected. We believe this occurred to some extent in fiscal year 2023 and in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024\nand could continue.\nNHP imports into the U.S. for drug discovery significantly declined from 2022 to 2023. A decrease in overall NHP supply drove an increase in pricing in 2023.\nFurthermore, we believe the decreased U.S. NHP supply caused some studies to be shifted outside of the U.S. We also believe some clients increased their\ninventory levels of NHP’s during 2023 and therefore recently clients appear to be utilizing existing NHP inventory without purchasing normal levels of NHPs.\nRMS segment revenue decreased $49,143 in the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023 due primarily to the\nnegative impact of lower volumes of NHP sales, which decreased by 35.3% year-over-year. For the 2024 period, such reduction in revenue adversely affected\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, during 2022 and 2023 there was a decrease in biotech funding which has contributed to a reduced demand for preclinical studies. This reduced demand\nhas negatively impacted the Company’s DSA segment revenue.\n63\nTable of Contents\nIf the Company’s revenue and related operating margins do not increase, it would have an adverse effect on the Company’s business financial condition and\nresults of operations, and could result in non-compliance with the financial covenants under the Company’s Credit Agreement, as discussed elsewhere in this\n“Risk Factors” section.\nRisks Related to Share Ownership\nOur share price could continue to be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common shares has historically been and might continue to be volatile. Many factors may have a significant impact on the future price\nof our common shares, including:\n• the fact that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;\n• our failure to successfully implement our business objectives;\n• our businesses, operations, results and prospects;\n• changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations by equity research analysts;\n• compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n• market acceptance of our products;\n• technological innovations, new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors;\n• changes in government regulations, taxes, legal proceedings and other developments;\n• inspections, investigations and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities against us or our principal suppliers;\n• negative information related to, or adverse regulatory or other actions against us or our principal suppliers;\n• pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as COVID-19;\n• general economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, and other external factors;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results and those of our competitors;\n• announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n• market conditions in CRO or research model industries;\n• additions or departures of key management personnel;\n• future mergers and strategic alliances;\n• investor sentiment toward the stock of animal breeding companies;\n• maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality;\n• ability to fund future growth;\n• the degree of trading liquidity in our common shares; and\n• our ability to meet the minimum standards required for remaining listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nFactors which may impact the price of our common shares include influences beyond our control, such as market conditions and changes in the pharmaceutical\nand biotechnology industries we serve. The stock market, and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks, has experienced\nperiods of significant price and volume fluctuations, including as a result of recent elevated interest rates and inflation. Volatility and valuation decline have\naffected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and also have adversely affected\nthe price of our common shares.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation and derivative securities\nlitigation have often been instituted against that company, as has been the case with us. Such occurrences of litigation could result in very substantial costs,\ndivert management’s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nITEM 2 – UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNot applicable.\n64\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3 – DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4 – MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5 – OTHER INFORMATION\nTrading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated any\ncontract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of our securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of\nthe Exchange Act or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in the SEC’s rules).\nEquity Awards\nThe Company’s Compensation Committee of the Board and Board of Directors have approved certain equity-based awards under the Company’s 2024 Equity\nIncentive Plan, to be granted on August 10, 2024.
