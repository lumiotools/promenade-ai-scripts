Maximize Your Marketing ROI\n\n10.11.2024 | Featured Homepage, Holiday, Custom Store, Swag, Marketing, 2024, Corporate Gifts\n\nThe holiday season is nearly upon us, and this time of year isn‚Äôt just for celebration‚Äîit‚Äôs the perfect time to connect with the people who help shape your business. And one of the best ways to do that? Sending thoughtful, personalized gifts to your professional network.\n\nCorporate gifting might seem like a small gesture, but it makes a big impact in terms of building lasting relationships with your clients and employees. Let‚Äôs dive into why sending gifts during the holidays is more than just a nice-to-do; it‚Äôs a smart strategy that can drive business opportunities in the new year and beyond. \n\n![Corporate Gifting 2 copy](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Corporate%20Gifting%202%20copy.png?width=511&height=304&name=Corporate%20Gifting%202%20copy.png)\n\n## Why Appreciation Gifts Matter\n\nWhen we talk about ‚Äúmaking lasting connections‚Äù, what it really comes down to is helping your network feel valued. And what better way to show someone in your network that they matter than with a customized, high-quality gift just for them? Corporate gifts can do so much more than simply saying thank you; they‚Äôre a way of strengthening the bonds that help drive your business forward.\n\nA gift says, ‚ÄúI see you, and I value what you bring to the table.‚Äù It helps foster trust, loyalty, and stronger relationships, whether that‚Äôs with a long-term client or an employee who‚Äôs been grinding away all year.\n\nIf valuing your network doesn‚Äôt quite convince you that corporate gifting is worth it, check out these proven impacts that sharing branded gifts can have on your business. \n\n#1 - Strengthen Relationships With Clients and Employees\n\nA recent industry study showed that a whopping 80% of corporate gift buyers say that gifting helped improve their relationships with clients and employees. Surprised? It‚Äôs an impressive stat, but the reason is simple: corporate gifts make people feel seen, valued, and appreciated.\n\nGifts with a little creativity and personal touch can also deliver a memorable experience to recipients. This approach taps into the idea of ‚Äúsurprise and delight‚Äù, and shows that you value your relationship beyond business transactions.\n\nPro tip: [Choose gifts](/holiday-merch) that align with the recipient‚Äôs interests or reflect your shared values to really drive home your connection. \n\n2. Improve Customer Loyalty\n\nIf you want to keep your customers coming back, consider sending them a holiday gift. Roughly  70% of businesses believe that gifting enhances brand loyalty. \n\nAnd that makes sense, right? A thoughtful holiday gift lets your customers know they‚Äôre more than just a number; it shows that you appreciate their business, and builds an even more positive association with your brand.\n\nBonus: Your branded gifts serve as regular reminders of your company. When a customer uses their branded gift (for example, a [cozy new fleece](/promotional-products/apparel) or [sleek tumbler](/promotional-products/drinkware)), they‚Äôre more likely to think of your brand when it‚Äôs time to make a purchase again.\n\n3. Boost Employee Retention and Productivity\n\nEveryone wants to feel appreciated, and your employees are no different. In fact, 75% of employees say they feel more valued and motivated when they receive gifts from their employer. And during the holidays, a small gesture can really lift spirits.\n\nGifting your team members something special shows you see their hard work and dedication, and that you value them beyond their workplace responsibilities. \n\nAnd in return? Happier employees do better work. So take time to share gifts that your team will use again and again to help your employees feel recognized and part of the bigger picture.\n\n4. Generate New Leads and Nurture Relationships\n\nHere‚Äôs where gifting really starts to have a measurable ROI: a well-chosen gift can increase the likelihood of a prospect taking a favorable action by 2.3 times. That‚Äôs right‚Äîa thoughtful gift can help turn a lead into a customer or reignite a connection with someone you haven‚Äôt heard from in a while.\n\nThink of holiday gifting as an icebreaker or a relationship-building tool. It gives you an excuse to reach out in a way that feels warm and personal, rather than just a business transaction. \n\n5. Increase Brand Awareness\n\nBranded gifts aren‚Äôt just appreciated‚Äîthey're cherished over time. As many as 87% of recipients keep corporate gifts for over a year, meaning your brand stays in front of them for a long time. A useful or unique branded item becomes a part of their daily lives, subtly keeping your company top of mind.\n\nWhether it‚Äôs branded drinkware or a [tech accessory](/promotional-products/technology), these items carry your brand into the recipient‚Äôs workspace or home, continuously promoting your business in an organic way. This brand visibility is invaluable, particularly during the holiday season when competition for attention is high.\n\nHow to Build an Effective Corporate Gifting Program![FathersDay_GiftGuide_Hero_1688x1350](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/FathersDay_GiftGuide_Hero_1688x1350.png?width=482&height=385&name=FathersDay_GiftGuide_Hero_1688x1350.png)\n\nIf you‚Äôre thinking of incorporating corporate gifting into your holiday strategy, consider the following best practices:\n\nPersonalization is key: Tailor your gifts to the recipient's interests or your shared business goals. [Customization](/promotional-products) adds a thoughtful touch that makes your gift stand out.\n\nThink practical yet unique: While you want your gift to be useful, adding a creative element helps make it memorable. Branded tech accessories, stylish drinkware, or [premium apparel](/fall-winter-apparel) are great options.\n\nFocus on quality: Low-quality gifts can reflect poorly on your brand. Choose items that convey the same high standards you apply to your business.\n\nTo ensure your corporate gifting program is a success, consider partnering with an expert who can help you navigate options, customization, and fulfillment. Our [corporate gifting services](https://www.stran.com/services/corporate-gifts) at Stran are designed to help you make a lasting impression with thoughtfully curated, high-quality gifts that align with your brand and your recipients‚Äô preferences.\n\nMake an Impact this Holiday Season\n\nThis holiday season, leverage the power of corporate gifting to strengthen relationships, enhance loyalty, and increase brand awareness. A thoughtful, well-executed gifting program can leave a lasting impression on your clients, employees, and business partners.\n\nReady to take your corporate gifting strategy to the next level?

2024\n\n06.07.2024 | Events, Swag, Pride, 2024, Seasonal, Nonprofit\n\n![Screenshot 2024-06-06 163327](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screenshot%202024-06-06%20163327.png?width=888&height=586&name=Screenshot%202024-06-06%20163327.png)\n\nPride Month celebrates the LGBTQ+ community's history, contributions, and ongoing fight for equality. While June brings vibrant parades and events, the spirit of Pride calls for year-round commitment. Celebrations are exciting, but true allyship comes from putting diversity and inclusion at the forefront every day. In this article we‚Äôll highlight how Chipotle, Coca-Cola, and Converse celebrate Pride and work to build equality in the workplace. Take a look for some inspiration on creative and meaningful ways to support your LGBTQ+ team members this year.\n\n## What is Pride and Why It Matters\n\nOriginating from the 1969 Stonewall Riots, Pride month reminds us of the progress towards equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community and the work that still lies ahead. It's a time to celebrate, reflect, and advocate for a world where everyone is accepted for who they are. The significance of Pride goes beyond parades and rainbow flags; it's about recognizing and uplifting the voices of those who have been marginalized and continuing the push for equal rights. \n\n## Companies WITH Pride in their DNA \n\n## Chipotle\n\nChipotle's [\"Love What Makes You Real\"](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2024-05-29-CHIPOTLES-LOVE-WHAT-MAKES-YOU-REAL-CAMPAIGN-RETURNS-FOR-PRIDE-MONTH-AND-BEYOND) campaign returns for Pride Month 2024, celebrating authenticity with limited-edition Pride uniforms and merchandise. Employees can participate by requesting a Pride-themed uniform shirt. Sales from [Chipotle‚Äôs Pride Edit](https://chipotlegoods.com/) merchandise collection benefit [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/), and customers can join in the effort by rounding up their orders to help the same charity. Chipotle also builds representation and cultivates community impact by participating in Pride parades in Orange County, California, and Columbus, Ohio. \n\n## Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola has a rich history of supporting the LGBTQ+ community through various initiatives and partnerships. In past years, Coca-Cola has launched [digital collectibles](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/media-center/pride-inspired-digital-collectibles-benefiting-lgbtqia-charities) to celebrate Pride, with proceeds supporting LGBTQIA+ charities. For Pride Month 2024, Coca-Cola continues to showcase its support with a variety of Pride-branded merchandise. This year, their [collection ](https://www.coca-colastore.com/collections/pride)features vibrant items including custom t-shirts, branded water bottles, special edition bags with a Pride version of their logo, and more. By offering these bespoke items, Coca-Cola empowers its customers to celebrate Pride and represent their favorite brand while supporting the LGBTQ+ community. This is a fantastic example of how large brands can make a positive impact through marketing. \n\n## Converse\n\n[Converse ](https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/releases/converse-10th-annual-lgbtqia-pride-campaign)is celebrating its 10th annual LGBTQIA+ Pride campaign 4 with a focus on storytelling and community support. For Pride 2024 the Boston-based lifestyle brand introduced a new collection featuring designs by LGBTQIA+ artists. The proceeds of these exclusive designs will benefit organizations including the [It Gets Better Project](https://itgetsbetter.org/) and the [Ali Forney Center](https://www.aliforneycenter.org/). Converse encourages employees to participate in local Pride events and offers educational resources to foster an inclusive workplace. The brand also highlights personal stories from LGBTQIA+ community members to amplify diverse voices and experiences.\n\n###### üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà [Looking For More Brand Inspiration For Pride? Check out Our Pride Lookbook!](/pride-2024)\n\n## Promoting Equality and Allyship in the Workplace\n\n## What Companies Can Do\n\nBuilding an inclusive workplace requires continuous effort. Here are five impactful jumping-off points that companies can enact to improve inclusivity, promote equality, and amplify marginalized voices: Diversity and Inclusion Training: Regular workshops help employees appreciate diverse perspectives and build a more inclusive culture. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs): ERGs for LGBTQ+ employees create a supportive community within the workplace. Comprehensive Benefits: Offer benefits that cover same-sex partners and support LGBTQ+ health needs, like gender-affirming surgery or therapy. Anti-Discrimination Policies: Enforce clear policies to protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Support for LGBTQ+ Events: To show genuine support, Sponsor Pride events, create custom merch, and support local LGBTQ+ causes.\n\n## How Employees Can Demonstrate Equality and Allyship\n\nEmployees can make a big difference in creating an inclusive workplace. Here are five practical ways to show equality and allyship: Ask for Pronouns: Respectfully ask colleagues for their pronouns and use them. MyPronouns.org is a great resource. Use Inclusive Language: Use terms like \"partner\" or \"spouse\" instead of \"husband\" or \"wife\" to include everyone. Learn Continuously: Educate yourself on LGBTQ+ issues through resources like GLAAD and The Trevor Project. Create (or Be!) a Safe Space: Offer support by listening and amplifying the voices of your LGBTQ+ colleagues and by advocating for inclusive policies. Join Events: Participate in Pride and other LGBTQ+ events to show your support. \n\n# What Do Companies Do for Pride Month?\n\n1 - Organize Pride Events Companies can host or participate in local Pride parades, workshops, and seminars. These events create visibility, show public support for the LGBTQ+ community, and promote a sense of inclusivity and engagement among employees and customers. For example, check out Boston Pride for event ideas.\n\n2 - Develop Authentic and Inclusive Marketing Campaigns Pride isn't about rainbow-washing your brand's feed‚Äîthat's just hopping on the marketing bandwagon. Instead, use Pride Month as a jumping-off point for making your content more inclusive year-round. Consider bringing in guest posters from the LGBTQ+ community to raise awareness or showcasing LGBTQ+ stories and achievements to promote genuine representation.\n\n3 - Support Charities Support charities by donating or partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, The Trevor Project, and GLAAD. This financial support helps these organizations continue their vital work and reflects your company's dedication to social responsibility. Want more ways to support charities? Check out #4 on our list. It might inspire you to create limited-edition promotional items that support the LGBTQ+ community and help raise money for these important organizations.\n\n4 - Create Custom Promotional Products When your brand stands for something, you want to shout it to the word‚Äîand custom promotional products help you do just that! One way to support Pride is by creating and selling Pride-themed products that match your brand's values and support your broader inclusivity goals. Popular options for branded merchandise include custom t-shirts, bags, and drinkware. These items can be used at events or sold, with proceeds supporting LGBTQ+ causes. Efforts like these demonstrate allyship and commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, help raise awareness, and promote inclusivity within your customer base. Plus, custom merch is a great and really fun way to show support for Pride in June and beyond!\n\n5 - Provide Employee Education Offer training sessions and resources on LGBTQ+ issues and allyship. Education fosters a more inclusive workplace by increasing awareness and understanding among employees, which is essential for creating a supportive and welcoming environment for everyone. \n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nPride is a movement, not a month. Companies committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce must model these expectations and behaviors for their teams. Household brands like Chipotle, Coca-Cola, and Converse may have large-scale, public Pride initiatives, but brands of every size can draw inspiration from these Pride campaigns and create their own ways to champion inclusivity, allyship, and equality. Don‚Äôt be afraid to get creative in cultivating a workplace where everyone feels valued and respected daily.\n\n### Want more Pride Content?

to Support Important Causes\n\n11.11.2024 | Featured Homepage, giving back, Holiday, Volunteering, Swag, 2024, Beverage, Corporate Gifts\n\nBreast Cancer Awareness Month might be over, but supporting the movement doesn‚Äôt have to end. The season of giving is just beginning, as the final quarter of the year has become a time for companies to refocus on giving back‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through donations, team volunteer events, or putting remaining budgets to good use in support of charitable causes.\n\nFor companies looking to make a meaningful impact, branded merchandise provides a unique opportunity to support causes that matter to them and their communities. Here‚Äôs how your organization can leverage merchandise to make a difference this season.\n\n### **Choosing Cause-Driven Brands in Corporate Gifting Programs**\n\nCorporate holiday gifts are an ideal way to give back while showing appreciation for employees, clients, and partners. By selecting mission-driven merchandise, you can make a positive impact through products that come with charitable giving built in.\n\n**Top Pick for Impact: Backpacks for the American Cancer Society**\n\nThese bags are a practical option for branded merch, and a portion of each purchase goes directly to the American Cancer Society. If you‚Äôre looking to continue Breast Cancer Awareness initiatives through the rest of the year, we can‚Äôt think of a better product than this bag.\n\n**![WHAT DO AWARDS LOOK LIKE](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE.png?width=421&height=421&name=WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE.png)**\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Contact our team to add this bag to your branded swag options this holiday season!\n\n**Mission-Driven Brands We Love**\n\nWe work with a host of brands that have giving back built into their business. By incorporating products from these brands into your holiday gifts, you‚Äôre giving a high-quality item that aligns with eco-friendly and socially responsible initiatives. **![WHAT DO AWARDS LOOK LIKE \\(1\\)](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE%20\\(1\\).png?width=232&height=689&name=WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE%20\\(1\\).png)**\n\n**Tentree: **Tentree‚Äôs mission is as clear as their name; the company is committed to planting ten trees for every item purchased in an effort to regenerate ecosystems, capture carbon and provide planting jobs in communities around the world. Their products are also created with an \"Earth-First\" approach, meaning they‚Äôre made in fair, safe working conditions, and constructed using only sustainably sourced and recycled materials.\n\n**MiiR: **MiiR keeps its mission closely connected to its product of high-quality drinkware by donating a portion of proceeds to fund clean water projects. In addition, the company has committed to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2030 and minimize the impact of materials, manufacturing, and distribution of their products.\n\n**Corkcircle:** Corkcircle has partnered with charity: water to ensure that every purchase made on Corkcicle products brings clean water to those in need. With the mantra of \"clean water changes everything,\" this company is on a mission to save lives, boost economies, and empower women through providing access to safe drinking water. \n\n**Storm Creek:** Storm Creek has sustainability ingrained in every layer of its organization, from the recycled bottles that become fibers of their high-quality apparel to their carbon-offset initiatives, this brand showcases how a major company can still put the planet first. In addition, the brand has a goal of donating $5 million to charity by 2030, and hit their first million in donations in 2022. \n\nShelter to Soldier: Shelter to Soldier is a CA 501c3 nonprofit organization that adopts dogs from local shelters and trains them to become psychiatric service dogs for post-9/11 combat veterans to help both recover and move forward. A portion of all proceeds from the Work¬Æ/iCOOL¬Æ is donated to Shelter to Soldier.\n\nSupporting brands with a mission amplifies the impact of your gifts, creating an opportunity for your company and recipients to connect with causes that align with their values.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Want to know what other brands and products are available for mission-driven merch? [Learn more here!](/mission-driven-merch)\n\n### **Creating Special Edition Merch to Fundraise for a Cause**\n\nThe holiday season is a great time to launch special edition merchandise, with proceeds dedicated to a cause close to your brand‚Äôs heart. Limited-edition items allow you to get creative with design while highlighting a purpose that resonates with your audience. We love [these examples](https://wwd.com/lists/companies-supporting-breast-cancer-awareness-month-1236644397/) of Breast Cancer Awareness supporting products, and we've seen some [truly creative ideas to support Pride](/blog/celebrate-pride-2024) each year.\n\nIf you're interested in creating special edition merchandise, you might consider products like [cozy fleece pullovers](/promotional-products/apparel) or [bags](/promotional-products/bags) that carry a message of hope or empowerment. For example, a limited-edition holiday sweater with a portion of sales going toward a nonprofit not only makes a memorable gift but also supports a meaningful mission. \n\n**Pro Tip:** If you create a special edition product to support the cause of your choice, make it clear about the intentions and impact of that product. People are more likely to support causes that come with a tangible outcome, so make sure to communicate the specific impact of each purchase‚Äîsuch as meals provided, funds raised for research, or resources allocated. This transparency adds value, helping your audience see how their support translates into real-world change.\n\n### **![WHAT DO AWARDS LOOK LIKE \\(2\\)](https://www.stran.com/hs-fs/hubfs/WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE%20\\(2\\).png?width=423&height=423&name=WHAT%20DO%20AWARDS%20LOOK%20LIKE%20\\(2\\).png)**\n\n### **Providing Branded Merch for Volunteering Events**\n\nFor companies organizing volunteer events, branded merch helps foster a sense of unity and provides a practical keepsake for the team and the organizations you support. \n\n**Team Unity Through Branded Apparel** : Outfit your volunteers with branded T-shirts, caps, or jackets to create a cohesive look during events. Branded apparel makes your team easily recognizable, promoting your brand‚Äôs involvement and demonstrating a united front for the cause.\n\nThis can also double as a fun way to experiment with design ‚Äî like these fundraiser T-Shirts that Stran created for a client! \n\n**Practical Products for the Partner Organization** : Gifting practical branded items‚Äîlike water bottles, hats, or tote bags‚Äîto the nonprofit and their clients or volunteers can extend your impact. These items not only serve as useful, everyday tools but also act as lasting reminders of your brand‚Äôs commitment to supporting their mission.\n\nMerch for volunteer events can serve as a memorable touchpoint for everyone involved, strengthening your company‚Äôs bond with the community and reinforcing your dedication to making a difference.\n\n### **Making a Lasting Impact With Purpose-Driven Merch**\n\nAs we enter a season that celebrates generosity, branded merchandise offers companies an effective, authentic way to engage with social causes. By choosing mission-driven products for corporate gifting, creating special edition merch with a purpose, and bringing branded items to volunteer events, you‚Äôre ensuring that every piece of merch contributes to a greater good. This holiday season, let your brand‚Äôs presence create lasting positive impact‚Äîone meaningful item at a time.\n\n### Loved this blog? get more insights from our team!\n\n[üëê Subscribe to our blog](https://share.hsforms.com/1bw1iPC-RQFmAI4s_Fu8-7g30kxd?__hstc=104330591.98ed62b34e2880ebad48b991d8e8b5f3.1723144411677.1730299339467.1730303715460.172&__hssc=104330591.12.1730303715460&__hsfp=1740939083)to get the first look at our latest swag collections\n\nüéß Reach out to our friendly branding experts\n\n### more Resources\n\n[Our Holiday Gift Guide](https://www.stran.com/holiday-merch)\n\n[2024 Top Retail Brand Gifts](https://www.stran.com/top-holiday-retail-brand-gifts)\n\n[How to Thank Your Employees This Holiday Season](https://www.stran.com/blog/how-to-thank-employees-this-holiday)\n\n[How Corporate Gifting Programs Maximize Your Marketing ROI](https://www.stran.com/blog/corporate-gifts-roi)\n\n[Simplify Holiday Gifting With a Custom Pop-Up Store](/blog/simplify-holiday-gifting-custom-pop-up-store)\n\n## Elevate Your Branded Merch Strategy\n\nContact us today to explore how our marketing services can be a game-changer for you!\n\n![_Kitting 2](https://www.stran.com/hubfs/_Kitting%202.jpg)\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nCompany Name*\n\nCompany Email*\n\nService Interested In*\n\nPlease SelectCorporate SwagEcompany Store Packaging & Point of Sale Tradeshow & Event ManagementWarehouse & FulfillmentPrint Management Engagement ProgramsCorporate Gifts\n"

For the past seven years, we‚Äôve gathered clients, vendors, and our team under one roof for our favorite event of the year.\n\nIt‚Äôs the perfect opportunity to explore the latest trends in merch, spend quality in-person time with our network, and most importantly, celebrate another successful year together.\n\nHosting this event has become a non-negotiable for us, and for good reason. Here are the Top 5 reasons we love hosting an open house for our network. \n\n## #1 - Strengthen Client Relationships \n\nAt the heart of any successful business are strong relationships. Our Open House gives us a chance to connect face-to-face with our clients, vendors, and team, going beyond virtual meetings to build genuine connections. This in-person time allows us to not only catch up but also share industry insights, understand our clients' needs better, and brainstorm new ways to collaborate.\n\nAnd of course, getting together with our network is _fun_! We‚Äôve cultivated incredible relationships over the past 30 years, and our Open House is the perfect opportunity to celebrate those bonds, talk shop, and enjoy the company of great people.\n\n## #2 - Showcase New Products & Trends\n\nStaying ahead of the latest trends in merch is our specialty, and our Open House is the ideal platform to showcase what's new. From innovative products to cutting-edge designs, this event lets us introduce our favorite finds to clients, vendors, and partners in a hands-on environment.\n\nNo matter how many emails we send or Zoom calls we host, nothing beats seeing and touching products in person. Our Open House lets everyone experience the quality and creativity of our offerings firsthand, making it easier to understand how we can elevate their brands through merch.\n\n## #3 - Get Feedback & Foster Collaboration \n\nCommunication is the key to any successful relationship, and our Open House creates the perfect space for open dialogue. Face-to-face interactions help us gather real-time feedback, brainstorm fresh ideas, and strengthen our collaborative efforts with clients and vendors alike. We‚Äôre deeply invested in the success of our partners, and this event is a way to show just how committed we are to making a positive impact in the industry. By listening to our network, we continue to evolve and innovate, keeping us at the forefront of the market.\n\n## #4 - Walk Down Memory Lane \n\nThis year, we‚Äôre celebrating our 30th anniversary with a ‚Äú1994‚Äù throwback theme. Expect ‚Äò90s-inspired cocktails, tunes, activities, and even attire! But beyond the nostalgia, our anniversary is a chance to reflect on how far we‚Äôve come as a company, the lessons we‚Äôve learned, and the relationships we‚Äôve built. We‚Äôve grown a lot since 1994, and we can‚Äôt wait to celebrate this milestone with the people who have been a part of our journey.\n\n## #5 - Highlight the Road Ahead\n\nInnovation has always been at the core of what we do, and our Open House is the perfect setting to showcase how we‚Äôre continuing to push boundaries in the merch world. We‚Äôll be offering product demos, showing off new branding techniques, and sharing insights from industry experts. Our \"Women on the Rise\" Cocktail Hour is another highlight of the event. This panel discussion, featuring five women leaders in the promotional products industry, will cover industry trends, best practices, and strategies for adapting to our ever-changing world (hello, AI!). It‚Äôs a great opportunity to network and gain valuable insights from some of the brightest minds in the business.\n\n## _Bonus!_ #6 - Explore the Possibilities of Merch\n\nOur Open House is designed to be an immersive experience, and we don‚Äôt hold back on that promise! With interactive activities, on-theme cocktails, and ‚Äò90s music setting the mood, we‚Äôll demonstrate exactly how merch can create memorable experiences. From innovative trending products to hands-on product customization and live demos, every year we strive to show our clients and vendors that we‚Äôre not just talking about the potential of branded products‚Äîwe‚Äôre living it. This event highlights the creativity and innovation we bring to our clients' merchandise programs and showcases the full range of possibilities that merch offers.\n\nCheck out this video from our 2023 Open House to get a peek at how we built an immersive experience for the event.\n\nCentered Video\n\n## Open House Events: A Win for Everyone\n\nAn open house is more than just a fun event‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful tool to strengthen relationships, showcase your offerings, and position your company as a leader in the industry. From creating lasting impressions to fostering new partnerships, the benefits are clear. By inviting your network to experience your products and services firsthand, you elevate your brand and deepen the connections that matter most. If you're a merchandising company looking to grow, consider making an open house part of your strategy.

Team building is important all year long, but summer offers the added opportunity to take advantage of the weather and shake things up. Team building isn‚Äôt just about taking a break from daily duties; it‚Äôs a simple, effective way to build connections and foster collaboration on your team. Check out our recommendations for team-building activity ideas below! \n\n# Why Team Building Is Important \n\nWhat makes team building so important? No matter what industry your business is in, you need to rely on your team to work together towards a common goal. That‚Äôs where team building comes in! Regular team building activities have been shown to enhance employee engagement and improve collaborative efforts. \n\nSummertime team building is especially helpful to keep folks connected despite summer travel and shifting routines! As many employees take time off in the summer or move to hybrid and remote schedules, planning a team-building activity can be a great way to make sure everyone on the team feels included, in the know, and connected to the overall mission and direction of the company. \n\nBut team building isn‚Äôt just about better business results; it‚Äôs also proven to boost morale and trust among a team. These added benefits can improve employee retention and strengthen positive company culture. When employees are connected, engaged, and feeling positive about their work life, everyone wins. \n\n# Four Types of Team Building Activities \n\nThere are endless examples of team building activities, and if you‚Äôre looking to create your own it can be helpful to organize them by ‚Äútype.‚Äù\n\nEach type of activity has a specific goal:\n\n**1. Communications Focused**\n\n2. Problem Solving\n\n3. Planning\n\n4. Trust Building \n\n_Want to see these a ctivity types in action? Read on for examples!  _\n\n## Communication Activities \n\nCommunication activities often involve active listening, critical thinking, varied communication techniques, and giving or receiving feedback. This is a great type of exercise for teams of any size, because everyone can benefit from improved communication. Plus, you might learn something about your team members in the process! \n\n###### **Summer Team Building Activity: Outdoor Scavenger Hunt**\n\nMost scavenger hunts involve three elements: items, clues, and prizes. Items are placed in strategic locations, and each clue offers a hint (sometimes even a brainteaser or riddle) to find the next item. Prizes are earned by solving the scavenger hunt quickly or with creative solutions.\n\nScavenger hunts make great team-building exercises because teams must work together to find the items, solve the clues, and move forward through the challenge. They also offer an opportunity for friendly competition and connectivity, especially for larger companies with multiple departments. \n\nRather than having teams organized by specialty (e.g. Finance team, Marketing team, Ops team), try setting teams with folks who wouldn‚Äôt normally connect in their day-to-day workflow. This allows for more diverse perspectives and helps individuals get to know each other better, setting everyone up for more collaboration in the future. \n\nWhen the scavenger hunt is set and the teams are organized, let the games begin! \n\n###### **Scavenger Hunt Swag**\n\n[**Solo Stove S'mores Bowl**](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/jjyl/?1718128139/#p=63)\n\nPerfect for summer adventures, this portable tabletop s‚Äômores roaster brings flickering flames and crackling campfire sounds with clean-burning, smoke-free gel fuel.

Our favorite problem-solving activity is an Escape Room, because it tasks a group with getting organized, communicating, and figuring out a solution that works for all. \n\n###### **Summer Team Building Activity: Escape Room Challenge**\n\nEscape Room Challenges are a top choice for group problem solving activities. From family reunions to corporate retreats, it‚Äôs clear that booking an Escape Room is a great way to get folks working together, and the thrill of racing the clock brings another level of fun to the activity. Want to make the most of Escape Room activities?\n\nBreak your team up into small groups ahead of time, and give each group the chance to select a team name and symbol. As the Escape Room date approaches, distribute [custom T-shirts and hats](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/pywj/#p=10) with each team name. Nothing gets folks excited like team pride and some friendly competition! Planning ahead also encourages each group to connect and create a winning strategy. Allowing folks to work together before the activity begins can help everyone problem-solve more efficiently during the challenge, and ensure everyone gets involved in solving the puzzle. And of course, don‚Äôt forget prizes. The fastest team to complete the activity can get the top prize, with other teams getting participation prizes, too. \n\n###### **Escape Room Swag**\n\n**[Next Level Apparel Stretch ¬Ω Zip Hoodie](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/ykfp/?1713274859/#p=19) **\n\nBring team spirit to your Escape Room challenge with personalized swag.

No matter what kind of work you do, everyone can benefit from coordination and adjusting on the fly. Planning activities can also overlap with other types of team-building exercises. For example, if your company plans a field-day, there are multiple activities, games, and initiatives that could happen on that day. \n\n###### Summer Team Building Activity: Field Day on the Beach\n\nSummer and the outdoors go hand in hand, don't they? Companies can take advantage of summer weather and foster collaboration by coordinating [games](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/pywj/#p=41), exercises, and initiatives at a beach or local park. Getting folks out of the office and into nature can also serve as a mental reset for teams, helping them bring a fresh perspective back to the office when it‚Äôs time to get back to work.\n\nFor a summer field day, try incorporating a few different types of activities from this list. An outdoor scavenger hunt, a sandcastle-building competition, relay races, and beach volleyball are all fun group activities to get folks engaged, communicating, and using their problem-solving skills in a fun and low-stakes environment. \n\nIt‚Äôs a great practice to offer prizes and incentives for every activity, and if you really want to get creative, set up an activity bracket or tournament. Throughout the day teams can advance or fall out of the running for a grand prize, and the whole staff can get in on cheering for their colleagues. \n\n###### Custom Merch that's Perfect for the Beach\n\n[PARKIT Voyager Chair ](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/jjyl/?1718128139/#p=66)\n\nDesigned for maximum comfort and ultimate durability, the PARKIT Voyager Chair is a summer relaxation prize for the outdoor enthusiast.

When team members trust one another, they‚Äôre more likely to brainstorm openly, offer honest opinions, try new ideas, and support each other. Trust is necessary to get the most out of your team, and any activity that challenges teammates to lean on each other is a good option.\n\nThe classic examples of trust-falls and blindfolded activities work great, but also consider collaboration games like a 3-legged race or a cooking competition. Another option is to invest in immersive offerings like a retreat to help people feel comfortable and more open to connection. \n\n###### Summer Team Building Activity: Team Recipe Challenge\n\nWhat better way to engage employees than by uniting over food? In this easy-to-facilitate team-building activity, break your team up into groups of three and offer the task of creating a recipe from scratch. Have one person write a recipe, another provide verbal instructions, and the third person to cook the food.\n\nThis activity encourages good communication and trust among colleagues, and often brings lots of laughs. Teams will quickly realize that being clear and straightforward with communication is essential and that listening to one another is key to finding success. \n\nMake this activity more engaging with simple details like custom aprons and chef hats and offer prizes for the teams who generate the most creative and tastiest recipes. \n\n###### Trust Building Swag\n\n[Recycled Cotton Bib Front Apron](https://online.fliphtml5.com/cbxii/jjyl/?1718128139/#p=68)\n\nDurable, stylish, and brandable.
